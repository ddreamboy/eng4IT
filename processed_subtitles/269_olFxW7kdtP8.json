  "text": "hi guys i'm anirban from simply learn\nand today i will be giving you a\ntutorial on one of the most talked about\ntopics in the world of technology and\nthat is machine learning\ni'm sure that if you are watching this\nvideo you must have heard about machine\nlearning somewhere or the other and yes\nit is quite an intriguing topic\nthis video will act as a supplement for\nthe ones who know the basics of machine\nlearning and are aware of where it is\nbeing used and how it is being used for\nthe ones who are completely new to this\nyou don't have to worry\nwe will be brushing up the basics as\nwell\nso to start off with let's have a look\nat the agenda\nfirst we'll look into a life without\nmachine learning\nthen we'll move into a life with machine\nlearning\nthen we'll try to understand what is\nmachine learning actually\nthen we look into the types of machine\nlearning we'll talk about the right\nmachine learning solutions\nthen we'll move into the different\nalgorithms that machine learning has\nlet's talk about a life without machine\nlearning\nfor someone who doesn't know anything\nabout machine learning or artificial\nintelligence he or she might think that\nit is only being used in robots or\nmachines and stuff which is actually\ntrue as ported by most of the sci-fi\nmovies nowadays\nbut you wouldn't believe how much more\nmachine learning is giving us how much\nof it we are using in our daily lives\nlet's say you need information on any\nrandom topic say a computer\nthe first place you would check would\ndefinitely be google right\nit would collect all the information on\nthe word you search for and present it\nto you according to relevance if there\nwas no google you would have to do it in\na very hard way that is by going through\ntens or hundreds of books and articles\neven after which you won't find the\nanswer\nif we go back four to five years facial\nrecognition would be a thing only showed\nin movies like mission impossible or\nterminator or any of the sci-fi movies\nyou pick\nbut machine learning has made it\npossible for facebook and instagram to\nuse this feature for your benefits you\ndon't have to go through the trouble of\ntagging every single person present in a\npicture that you have posted\nfacebook will automatically recognize\nthe people in the photo and tag them for\nyou\nthat saves a lot of time for you doesn't\nit\nalso siri cortana iris all of them would\nnot be there to help you if there was no\nmachine learning\nnow that we know life would be a lot\nmore difficult without machine learning\nlet's look into the things that are run\nby machine learning and we are using\nthem on our daily basis\nlet's enter the world of gaming ps4s and\nxboxes have introduced virtual reality\nglasses which brings a whole new level\nof detail into gaming\nevery time your head moves in real world\nit replicates the movement in the\nvirtual world providing an excellent\ngaming experience\nthen there is gesture control gaming\nwhere in machine learning tracks your\nbody movement and makes a corresponding\nmovement in the game\nfinally in the game fifa your opponent\ntends to adapt based on the kind of\nstrategy or gameplay you follow\nthat is again done by machine learning\ni'm sure you must have shopped a lot\nfrom amazon so let's look into some of\nthe places amazon makes use of machine\nlearning\nlet's say you buy a formal t-shirt on\namazon now as you buy it it suggests you\nformal shoes ties blazers and apparels\nthat go with what you have bought\nthat's the recommendation system powered\nby machine learning again\nthe price on every product that you see\non amazon is varying every moment based\non demand\nthat's being done by machine learning\nalgorithms\nthen comes customer segmentation\ncustomer segmentation is one of the most\ncrucial thing for all the e-commerce\nplatforms machine learning helps them\ndifferentiate between customers based on\nwhat they buy how frequent are they and\ntheir reviews\nthis helps the companies to make sure\nthat their customers are taken care of\nand the needs are being fulfilled\nnow let's talk about an app\nthat you use on a daily basis to reach\noffice on time\nyes it's uber gaps once you have\ntraveled with uber you must have noticed\nthat it suggests you the places you\nmight want to go based on your previous\njourneys when you are taking a share how\ndoes the app make sure that the cab you\nget is travelled by the same route you\nwant to travel in\nthere are so many factors like the\ndistance the traffic the ratings all of\nit is taken care of by machine learning\nfor the past five minutes we have been\ntalking about how machine learning is\nimproving our lives where all it is\nbeing used i have probably said machine\nlearning 100 times already\ni think it's about time that i tell you\nwhat machine learning actually is\nlet's take an ordinary system that you\ncurrently are using it can't do much\nexcept from the basic operations that\nyou already know about\nnow\nlet's add artificial intelligence or for\na layman's point of view let's give the\nsame machine the power to think on its\nown\nthat is what machine learning basically\nis\nit's an application of artificial\nintelligence that provides systems the\nability to learn on their own and\nimprove from experience without being\nprogrammed externally\nso if your computer had machine learning\nmay be able to play the difficult parts\nof a game for you or probably solve a\ncomplicated mathematical equation for\nyou\nthat could be really helpful\nlet's dive in a little deeper and see\nhow machine learning works\nlet's say you provide a system with the\ninput data that carries the photos of\nvarious kinds of fruits now you want the\nsystem to figure out what are the\ndifferent fruits and group them\naccordingly so what the system does it\nanalyzes the input data\nthen it tries to find patterns patterns\nlike shapes size and color\nbased on these patterns the system will\ntry to predict the different types of\nfruit and segregate them\nfinally it keeps track of all such\ndecisions it took in the process to make\nsure it's learning the next time you ask\nthe same system to predict and segregate\nthe different types of fruits\nit won't have to go through the entire\nprocess again\nthat's how machine learning works\nnow let's look into the types of machine\nlearning\nmachine learning is primarily of three\ntypes first one is supervised machine\nlearning as the name suggests you have\nto supervise your machine learning while\nyou train it to work on its own it\nrequires labeled training data\nnext up is unsupervised learning wherein\nthere will be training data but it won't\nbe labeled\nfinally there's reinforcement learning\nwherein the system learns on its own\nlet's talk about all these types in\ndetail\nlet's try to understand how supervised\nlearning works look at the pictures very\nvery carefully the monitor depicts the\nmodel or the system that we are going to\ntrain\nthis is how the training is done\nwe provide a data set that contains\npictures of a kind of a fruit say an\napple\nthen we provide another data set which\nlets the model know that these pictures\nwere that of a fruit called apple\nthis ends the training phase\nnow\nwhat we will do is we provide a new set\nof data which only contains pictures of\napple\nnow here comes the fun part the system\ncan actually tell you what fruit it is\nand it will remember this and apply this\nknowledge in future as well that's how\nsupervised learning works you are\ntraining the model to do a certain kind\nof an operation on its own\nthis kind of a model is generally used\ninto filtering spam mails from your\nemail accounts as well\nyes\nsurprise aren't you\nso let's move on to unsupervised\nlearning now let's say we have a data\nset which is cluttered in this case we\nhave a collection of pictures of\ndifferent fruits we feed this data to\nthe model and the model analyzes the\ndata to figure out patterns in it\nin the end it categorizes the photos\ninto three types as you can see in the\nimage based on their similarities\nso you provide the data to the system\nand let the system do the rest of the\nwork simple isn't it\nthis kind of a model is used by flipkart\nto figure out the products that are well\nsuited for you\nhonestly speaking this is my favorite\ntype of machine learning out of all the\nthree and this type has been widely\nshown in most of the sci-fi movies\nlately\nlet's find out how it works\nimagine a newborn baby\nyou put a burning candle in front of the\nbaby\nthe baby does not know that if it\ntouches the flame its fingers might get\nburned\nso it does that anyway and gets hurt\nthe next time you put that candle in\nfront of the baby it will remember what\nhappened the last time and would not\nrepeat what it did\nthat's exactly how reinforcement\nlearning works\nwe provide the machine with a data set\nwherein we ask it to identify a\nparticular kind of a fruit in this case\nan apple\nso what it does as a response it tells\nus that it's a mango\nbut as we all know it's a completely\nwrong answer so as a feedback we tell\nthe system that it's wrong it's not a\nmango it's an apple what it does it\nlearns from the feedback and keeps that\nin mind\nwhen the next time when we ask a same\nquestion it gives us the right answer it\nis able to tell us that it's actually an\napple that is a reinforced response so\nthat's how reinforcement learning works\nit learns from its mistakes and\nexperiences\nthis model is used in games like prince\nof persia or assassin's creed or fifa\nwherein the level of difficulty\nincreases as you get better with the\ngames just to make it more clear for you\nlet's look at a comparison between\nsupervised and unsupervised learning\nfirstly the data involved in case of\nsupervised learning is labeled as we\nmentioned in the examples previously\nwe provide the system with a photo of an\napple and let the system know that this\nis actually an apple\nthat is called label data so the system\nlearns from the label data and makes\nfuture predictions\nnow unsupervised learning does not\nrequire any kind of label data because\nits work is to look for patterns in the\ninput data and organize it\nthe next point is that you get a\nfeedback in case of supervised learning\nthat is once you get the output the\nsystem tends to remember that and uses\nit for the next operation\nthat does not happen for unsupervised\nlearning\nand the last point is that supervised\nlearning is mostly used to predict data\nwhereas unsupervised learning is used to\nfind out hidden patterns or structures\nin data\ni think this would have made a lot of\nthings clear for you regarding\nsupervised and unsupervised learning\nnow let's talk about a question that\neveryone needs to answer before building\na machine learning model\nwhat kind of a machine learning solution\nshould we use\nyes you should be very careful with\nselecting the right kind of solution for\nyour model because if you don't you\nmight end up losing a lot of time energy\nand processing cost\ni won't be naming the actual solutions\nbecause you guys aren't familiar with\nthem yet\nso we will be looking at it based on\nsupervised unsupervised and\nreinforcement learning\nso let's look into the factors that\nmight help us select the right kind of\nmachine learning solution\nfirst factor is the problem statement\ndescribes the kind of model you will be\nbuilding or as the name suggests it\ntells you what the problem is\nfor example let's say the problem is to\npredict the future stock market prices\nso for anyone who is new to machine\nlearning would have trouble figuring out\nthe right solution\nbut with time and practice you will\nunderstand that for a problem statement\nlike this\nsolution based on supervised learning\nwould work the best for obvious reasons\nthen comes the size quality and nature\nof the data if the data is cluttered you\ngo for unsupervised if the data is very\nlarge and categorical we normally go for\nsupervised learning solutions\nfinally we choose the solution based on\ntheir complexity\nas for the problem statement wherein we\npredict the stock market prices it can\nalso be solved by using reinforcement\nlearning\nbut that would be very very difficult\nand time consuming unlike supervised\nlearning\nalgorithms are not types of machine\nlearning\nin the most simplest language they are\nmethods of solving a particular problem\nso the first kind of method is\nclassification which falls under\nsupervised learning\nclassification is used when the output\nyou are looking for is a yes or no or in\nthe form a or b or true or false like if\na shopkeeper wants to predict if a\nparticular customer will come back to\nhis shop or not he will use a\nclassification algorithm\nthe algorithms that fall under\nclassification are decision tree knife\nbase random forest logistic regression\nand\nknn the next kind is regression\nthis kind of a method is used when the\npredicted data is numerical in nature\nlike if the shopkeeper wants to predict\nthe price of a product based on its\ndemand it would go for regression the\nlast method is clustering\nclustering is a kind of unsupervised\nlearning again it is used when the data\nneeds to be organized\nmost of the recommendation system used\nby flipkart amazon etc make use of\nclustering\nanother major application of it is in\nsearch engines the search engines study\nyour old search history to figure out\nyour preferences and provide you the\nbest search results\none of the algorithms that fall under\nclustering is k-means\nnow that we know the various algorithms\nlet's look into four key algorithms that\nare used widely\nwe will understand them with very simple\nexamples\nthe four algorithms that we will try to\nunderstand are k nearest neighbor\nlinear regression\ndecision tree and naive bayes\nlet's start with our first machine\nlearning solution k nearest neighbor k\nnear its neighbor is again a kind of a\nclassification algorithm as you can see\non the screen the similar data points\nform clusters\nthe blue one\nthe red one\nand the green one there are three\ndifferent clusters\nnow if we get a new and unknown data\npoint it is classified based on the\ncluster closest to it or the most\nsimilar to it\nk in k n is the number of nearest\nneighboring data points we wish to\ncompare the unknown data with\nlet's make it clear with an example\nlet's say we have three clusters in a\ncost to durability graph\nfirst cluster is of footballs\nthe second one is of tennis balls\nand the third one is of basketballs\nfrom the graph we can say that the cost\nof footballs is high and the durability\nis less\nthe cost of tennis balls is very less\nbut the durability is high and the cost\nof basketballs\nis as high as the durability\nnow let's say we have an unknown data\npoint\nwe have a black spot which can be one\nkind of the balls but we don't know what\nkind it is\nso what we'll do we'll try to classify\nthis using knn\nso if we take k is equal to 5 we draw a\ncircle keeping the unknown data point at\nthe center and we make sure that we have\nfive\nballs inside that circle in this case we\nhave a football a basketball and three\ntennis balls\nnow since we have the highest number of\ntennis balls inside the circle\nthe classified ball would be a tennis\nball\nso that's how k nearest neighbor\nclassification is done\nlinear regression is again a type of\nsupervised learning algorithm this\nalgorithm is used to establish linear\nrelationship between variables one of\nwhich would be dependent and the other\none would be independent\nlike if we want to predict the weight of\na person based on his height\nweight would be the dependent variable\nand height would be independent\nlet's have a look at it through an\nexample\nlet's say we have a graph here showing a\nrelationship between height and weight\nof a person\nlet's put the y-axis as h\nand the\nx-axis as weight\nso the green dots are the various data\npoints\nthese green dots are the data points\nand d\nis the mean squared error that is the\nperpendicular distances from the line to\nthe data points\nare the error values\nthis error tells us how much the\npredicted values vary from the original\nvalue\nlet's ignore this blue line for a while\nso let's say if this is our regression\nline\nyou can see the distance from all the\ndata points from this line is very high\nso if we take this line as a regression\nline\nthe error in the prediction will be too\nhigh\nso\nin this case the model will not be able\nto give us a good prediction\nlet's say we draw another regression\nline here like this\neven in this case you can see that the\nperpendicular distance of the data\npoints from the line is very high\nso the error value will still come as\nhigh as the last one\nso this model will also not be able to\ngive us a good prediction\nso what to do\nso finally we draw a line which is this\nblue line\nso here we can see that the distance of\nthe data points from the line is very\nless\nrelative to the other two lines we drew\nso the value of d for this line will be\nvery less\nso in this case if we take\nany value on the x-axis the\ncorresponding value on the y-axis will\nbe our prediction\nand\ngiven the fact that the d is very low\nour prediction should be good also\nthis is how regression works\nwe draw a line a regression line that is\nin such a way that the value of d is the\nleast eventually giving us good\npredictions\nthis algorithm that is decision tree is\na kind of an algorithm you can very\nstrongly relate to\nit uses a kind of a branching method to\nrealize the problem and make decisions\nbased on the conditions\nlet's take this graph as an example\nimagine yourself sitting at home getting\nbored you feel like going for a swim\nwhat you do is you check if it's sunny\noutside so that's your first condition\nif the answer to that condition is yes\nyou go for a swim if it's not sunny then\nthe next question you would ask yourself\nis if it's raining outside so that's\ncondition number two if it's actually\nraining you cancel the plan and stay\nindoors if it's not raining then you\nwould probably go outside and have a\nwalk\nso that's the final node\nthat's how decision tree algorithm works\nyou probably use this every day it\nrealizes a problem and then takes the\ndecisions based on the answers to every\nconditions\nnybis algorithm is mostly used in cases\nwhere a prediction needs to be done on a\nvery large data set it makes use of\nconditional probability\nconditional probability is the\nprobability of an event say a happening\ngiven that another event b has already\nhappened\nthis algorithm is most commonly used in\nfiltering spam mails in your email\naccount\nlet's say you receive a mail\nthe model goes through your old spam\nmail records\nthen it uses space theorem to predict if\nthe present mail is a spam mail or not\nso pc of a is the probability of even c\noccurring when a has already occurred\nb\na of c is the probability of event a\noccurring when c has already occurred\nand b c\nis the probability of event c occurring\nand p a is a probability of event a\noccurring\nlet's try to understand naive bayes with\na better example\nnybase can be used to determine on which\ndays to play cricket\nbased on the probabilities of a day\nbeing rainy windy or sunny the model\ntells us if a match is possible\nif we consider all the weather\nconditions to be event a for us\nand the probability of a match being\npossible even c\nso the model applies the probabilities\nof event a and c into the bayes theorem\nand predicts if a game of cricket is\npossible on a particular day or not\nin this case if the probability of c of\na is more than 0.5 we can be able to\nplay a game of cricket if it's less than\n0.5 we won't be able to do that that's\nhow naive algorithm works\nso that brings us to the end of the\nvideo i hope you guys understood the\nconcepts put your doubts and feedbacks\nin the
