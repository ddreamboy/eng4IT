  "text": "hey how you doing so JavaScript is the\nmost popular programming language in the\nworld today and for the foreseeable\nfuture and it's not because it's the\nbest there's no such thing as the best\nprogramming language that does not exist\nit's a fantasy it's a fantasy so why is\nJavascript the most popular language in\nthe world today well because it it's the\nonly game in town in terms of the web\nbrowser\nso that gives it a nice stable base to\nwork off of and because developers had\nthis weird idea that somehow having the\nsame language on the server and on the\nclient that's the web browser client is\nthe web browser since they thought that\nwas better uh JavaScript has been widely\nimplemented to work on the back end as\nwell on the server backend is\nserver with node so uh yeah there you go\nthat's the main reason why now it's also\na very light in Nimble language\nuh it's not verbos like we see in Java c\nnot that I'm picking on Java\nC and uh there you go\nso the problem with JavaScript though is\nthat it's a huge mess at the same time\nyou\ngot 100 million Frameworks to choose\nfrom a new framework comes out every 69\nseconds and of course that new framework\nis the best framework since sliced bread\nso I'm Uncle Steph I've been developing\nfor three decades for longer than you've\nbeen alive probably so I'm just going to\ngive you my uh ancient\nnerds perspective on JavaScript so I\nwent looking around on the interweb so\nyou don't have to and we're going to\nlook at some data with regards to\nJavaScript Frameworks and so on so\nbuckle up because it's going to be not\nvery interesting all right so I started\nlooking around and within about 15\nminutes I fell asleep but I did get some\ngood information so let me just jump\ninto the first site here so we got this\nuh Lambda test site so I give them a\nlittle shout out because they put out\nthis very thorough article I have\nnothing to do with them though I don't\nknow if their product is any good but\nthis article is interesting and we'll\nlook at others so 27 best JavaScript uh\nFrameworks in\n2024 so let's look at some data in terms\nof popularity so here's a\nsurvey\nuh as per the state of JS 2022 survey\nhere are eight best JavaScript so it's\nfrom\n2022 anyway no it's yeah up to 2022 so\nyou can see I don't know let me see if I\ncan zoom in\nhere so uh you see in 2016 react was 53%\nangular 20% Ember 14% view 10% so we're\ngoing to zoom forward to 2020 2 and I\nbelieve the trends have continued you\nsee react is by far dominant\n82% angular 49% I'm suppli I'm surprised\nit went up to be honest with you\nactually went down from uh it peaked in\n2018 2019 so it's actually on the way\ndown and you can see on the top blue\nhere react is actually it's hovering\naround the same for several years now\nVue uh vuejs which was at 10% 2016 it's\nreally jumped up when 10 22 32 47 49 51\nback down\n46 so um anyway so you got these other\nFrameworks as well so what you have to\ndo as a developer is uh you're going to\nhave to learn every single framework\nthat's out there because they're all the\nbest okay you don't have to learn every\nsingle framework that is out there if\nyou want to get into advanced JavaScript\ndevelopment\nmy advice is concentrate on your\nfundamentals of JavaScript first of all\nyou have to know the core language you\nhave to know core Dom manipulation then\nback up look a little bit at node maybe\nspend two three days on\nnodejs and then once you got your head\nwrapped around that just again just the\nbasics I'm not say you're not going to\nbe an expert at node in two three days\nbut you're just going to get your head\nwrapped around the basic if you\nunderstand the foundations of JavaScript\nwell enough so so the next thing you do\nis you jump into I would pick uh maybe\nthe top three framework to spend two\nthree days on each just to get your head\nwrapped around them so you kind of\nunderstand what they are all about right\nagain uh all these JavaScript Frameworks\nI would consider these need to nerd\nTechnologies meaning you only learn them\nwhen you need to learn them based on\njobs so you see here the top three right\nnow well in 2022 and I'm sure the trend\nis about the same as react angular View\nso I would spend two three days on react\ntwo three days on angular two three days\non view you're going to see you're going\nto learn these pretty quickly again the\nbasics I'm not saying you're going to be\nan expert at least but you can\nunderstand and if you uh feel so\ninclined maybe look at schel and Ember\nand others um I wouldn't go down into\nthe the weeds here with these other ones\nI wouldn't spend too much time you don't\nwant to get caught up in tutorial Hell\nby the way you don't want to be\ncontinuously\nuh researching and so on again Pro\ndevelopers they learn their fundamentals\nyou may learn one Library one framework\nrather one library and then you just\nwant to get into the game you want to\nstart building web apps websites you\ndon't want to start you don't want to be\na Perma student that's not the way to go\ndevelopers in the first uh the first 3\nto four years is when you really learn\nthe craft you get paid to learn these\nthings that's a good thing so in this\narticle they say react also known as\nreact GS is one of the best JavaScript\nFrameworks in the front end category it\nis an open source friend end JavaScript\nlibrary created by the team at Facebook\ndevelopers blah blah blah react\nintroduces a component based functional\nand declarative programming style for\nCreative interactive user interfaces for\nmainly single page web\napplications react delivers blazingly\nfast fast rendering making making use of\nvirtual Dom so they go into it I will\nskip those details so let's see what\nthey say pros of react it's component\nbased reusable components that's good uh\neasy integration easy integration of the\nfront end and backend Frameworks like\nthe popular PHP framework laravel to\nwork seamlessly without a hitch uh\nDirection data flow main difference\nbetween react JS follows a downward\ndirectional data flow\narchitecture this ensures that a Child\nEl element cannot affect a parent making\nthe code more stable and less prone to\nerrors all right simpler syntax that's\ngood virtual Dom okay cool SEO all right\nso it's SEO friendly yeah that makes\nsense because if what's seo seo short\nfor search engine optimization a\ntraditional single page applications uh\nbecause the URLs were kind were hidden\num it would be difficult\nfor Google let's face that's the only\nsearch engine that people really pay\nattention to for the most part\nGoogle would have would have a hard time\nindexing these things so with modern\nJavaScript Frameworks they create uh\nURLs that you Google can use to uh to\nbetter\num snarf up your website so it can uh so\nyou have SEO\nright uh yeah let's go\nback continuous Improvement uh Rich\nCommunity that's huge so yeah let me\njust comment on that when you're looking\nat any technology you have to look at\nits adoption in the uh by the community\nyou don't want to find yourself using\nsome Super Hyper Niche Tech you may\nthink it's the best tech since sliced\nbread but if nobody's using it it's\nyou're going to have less and less\nSupport over time and then you're going\nto find yourself uh abandoned uh this\nTech being abandoned and you're going to\nhave websites or web apps based on a\ntechnolog that is no longer relevant no\nlonger being supported that's big\ntrouble I've been there don't do that\nmake sure that there is a good Community\nbacking a particular technology whether\nit be JavaScript or any technology\nreally don't uh find yourself in some\nhyper Niche Tech so um the community is\na huge part of it so one of the first\nthings I look at I look at Community\nSupport so what are the cons although\njsx is simpler syntax but it's easy to\nread and comprehend it might present an\nadditional learning barrier okay many\ndevelopers feel react as much as a much\nsteeper learning curve and Bloated\ncomplexity uh van key rival Frameworks\nlike Vue and other best JavaScript\nFrameworks yeah I uh I've talked about\nthis many times for my learning SAS\nStudio web we use\nview for that reason react is often\nplayed with complaints about poor\ndocumentation and cannot catch up with\nthe new releases and features forcing\ndevelopers yeah well this is a\nJavaScript thing when you have a uh\nwhat's the word I'm looking for not an\nenvironment but when you have a tech\nthat moves so quickly uh documentation\nis often a problem don't undercount that\nby the\nway often times what makes a particular\ntechnology useful is how good the\ndocumentation is so don't undercount\nthat don't I uh I stress that I've seen\nit again per firsthand documentation is\nhuge so lots of big websites use react\nright Airbnb and so on so next one's\nangular so angular angular uh open\nsource framework by Google so angular is\nmore um I would say it's\nEnterprise so in 2022 they say angular\nhas ranked as the number two front end\nbest JavaScript fror in the state of JS\n2022 survey so it's a survey I'm not\nsure what the usage rates are uh stack\nOverflow developers in 2023 said angular\nwas r f was ranked fifth for front end\njobs scpt Frameworks with 17% positive\nresponse so it's quite opt it's quite uh\nbig uh I going to registered a massive\n3.5 million weekly uh downloads on\nnpm uh npm is the uh node package\nmanager it's the way you share libraries\nin the JavaScript world uh so they give\nyou the pros here I'll put the links\nbelow so you can read all this stuff\nyourself if you're really really really\nuh bored one day get up uh so what's\nthis cool a component base cool server\nperformance cool MVC I like MVC MVC is a\ndesign\npattern it's short for model view\ncontroller it's just a way that you\norganize your code into logical chunks\nand it's uh company a language called\nsmall talk I think it is Small Talk\ninvented that design pattern way back\n200,000 years\nago and uh yeah everybody's adopted it\nI'm a big MVC guy I was doing that in\nthe 90s with uh\neven classic ASP but mainly in\nJava all right two-way data binding one\nkey feature of angular is two-way data\nbinding which forms a link between the\nmodel layer and the view layer in such a\nway that each one reflects the change in\nthe other however other rival Frameworks\nhave adopted a one-way data B biing for\nSimplicity H that's uh again A lot of\ntimes when you're looking at specific\nfeatures of a framework the thinking\nbehind um how the framework\nWorks often times the choice between one\nor the other depends on the type of app\nyou are working on and the needs of an\napp so that's why I say you learn the\nbasics of let's say the top three so you\ncan again not becom an expert just don't\nspend months on this spend you know a\nfew days on each so at least you get an\nidea of what's going on here and you may\nsay okay for this particular app angular\nmight be better or for that particular\napp react might be better right\nuh massive Community third party\nIntegrations you know generally speaking\nfrom my uh\nunderstanding angular is is is really uh\nfor big big huge websites react can you\nbe us can be used on big websites but it\ncan also it's actually more approachable\ncould be wrong that was I haven't looked\nat these things closely in years so you\nknow they it for what it is cons typt\nto use angular you must use typescript\ntypescript is uh it's basically a\nmodified JavaScript if you will strongly\ntyped which makes it more secure uh\namongst other things uh apparently a\nposes a big learning challenge to new\ndevelopers yeah you know typescript is a\nbig barrier to entry and explains why\nangular has struggled against View and J\nreact in\nview if you know your JavaScript well\nyou should be able to get into\ntypescript pretty easily it's heavy and\nBloated yeah yeah that's how it was back\nin the\nday uh so heavy bloated 550 600 kilobyte\nfile not good which might not be suited\nfor small scale applications as I\nsaid angular is more of the Enterprise\nlevel stuff you're looking at heavy duty\nheavy duty uh\nwebsites poor SEO no SEO so yeah it's\nit's more that to me heavy bloated\npoo I would see oh maybe I should show\nyou this heavy\nbloated and poor SEO to me that screams\ninterprise development mean huge\norganization not maybe\nfor not so much for selling product not\na not for light Nimble sites uh who need\nto sell product and it's for Enterprise\nlevel application banking sites that\nkind of stuff view this is what I use\nthis is what we use in studio web open\nSource lightweight framework okay let's\nlook at Stats always like stats view has\nbeen has been placed at number three in\nthe list of best JavaScript Frameworks\nfor front end in the state of 2022\nsurvey so this is a survey this is\npeople's opinions right so that really\ntells you that it's probably the third\nmost used uh 46% of JavaScript devs\ncurrently use View and pledge to keep\nusing it while 50% have shown Keen\ninterest in using it so lots of you b\nboom 4.8 million weekly downloads so\nbigger than re angular strongest Ace r\nview is Simplicity any react or angular\ndeveloper can pick up view in a\nheartbeat without breaking a sweat yep\nthe structure of view is simple and\nenables you to code more with typeless\nsyntax view use a single file component\nsystem meaning that HTML CSS and\nJavaScript deide in a single file for\nany given component built-in MVC all\nright like that easy to learn boom boom\nboom very cool you see one things you\nhave to understand is the\ndeveloper when companies are looking at\nTechnologies they look at a lot of fun\nfactors but one of the factors they look\nat is how easy it is to get people new\ndevelopers trained in a particular Tech\nthat to me is a huge issue\nespecially especially for uh smaller\ncompanies like my businesses are all\nsmall businesses and so small easy to\nlearn lightweight Technologies what I\nalways look for uh amongst other\nthings another key Advantage it's\nsurprisingly white lightweight given the\nsize of its impressive prowess zip\nversion of you is barely 18 to 20 kiloby\nthat's pretty small much lighter than\nthe bloated bulky rifles like reacting\nangular so that to me is huge I like\nthat uh cannot be integration cannot\nonly be used to create application from\nscratch at blazing fast space could also\nPoss integrated into existing web app\nseamlessly without any trouble yeah view\nis\num I think it still is like it's default\nit is the default framework or library\nfor PHP laravel which is the the\ndominant uh MVC framework for the PHP\ncommunities con small\ncommunity so it doesn't have the backing\nof Facebook Google like reacting angular\nbut view has indeed managed to create a\ncommunity of backers on GitHub view has\n360 360 plus contributors which is\ndecent but nowhere closer to the ranking\nreact Joys at 1 1\n1,600 that's still pretty good I think\nyou're pretty good I'm think you're\npretty safe with react limited\nemployment\nopportunity yep you got to look at that\nlike any technology I always tell of\ncourse Adobe uses it Apple Swift\nUI laral lar well lar cast laral\nNintendo\nuh stack Overflow so you got a lot of\n[Music]\num BMW so you got a lot of big companies\nthat\nuse uh Vue so I think you're pretty safe\nthere Ember open source good scalable\nsingle page web page for business model\nview model view view model architecture\nis the foundation for Ember unlike other\nFrameworks we have discussed Ember was\noriginally a sprout Cor 4 2.0 framework\nthat was renamed Ember to by its creator\nYehuda cats an accomplished developer\ncreated as one of the chief creators of\njQuery huh one of the most adoring key\nfeatures Ember is Ember command line\ninterface tool which a productivity\nPowerhouse not bad even though Ember is\nan older front-end JavaScript framework\ncompared to react VI felt Shelt it's\nstill packs a punch it has big user\nbased with major companies like\nMicrosoft LinkedIn twitch okay rank\nnumber four\nin the uh JavaScript Frameworks in this\nsurvey here what are the cons steep\nlearning curve no good highly complex no\ngood highly opinionated opinion senses\nany deviation from things in a standard\nway might lead to frustrating problems\nthat's no good uh stagnation in popular\nsoftware stagnation over the last few\nyears falling to attract failing to\nattract new developers so you know\nanyway I'll stop there I'll just link to\nthe article so I'm H I'm providing some\nvalue in this uh stream stream that's\nnot a stream so let's uh I have another\nsite here and uh yeah so here's a visual\npresentation of uh so number one is\nreact to express three next for J jQuery\nfive U six what the hell is this Vite I\nnever heard of Vite anyway so this is uh\nA visual representation I think a plot\nof uh JavaScript Frameworks so they have\na nice summary here I'll put the link to\nthat one as well uh react angular view\nEmber backbone so same cast of\ncharacters how many JavaScript\nFrameworks are there about\n800,000 uh so I wouldn't get too\nconcerned about them all which are the\nbest JavaScript Frameworks to learn yeah\nyou know I would say learn the basics of\nreact the basics of view and learn node\nthat would be my choice and then from\nthere you'll be able to assess all the\nother Frameworks very very easily and\ncomparatively speaking so there you go\nthat's uh an overview of uh the\nJavaScript Frameworks I give you my two\ncents of how to approach it don't let it\noverwhelm you remember that there's no\ndeveloper out there who knows more than\n5% that's going on in a particular may\nmaybe 10% in a particular ecosystem I\ncan tell you there's no JavaScript\ndeveloper who knows all these Frameworks\nwell uh you might never actually use one\nof these JavaScript Frameworks by the\nway and if you do you might use just one\nmaybe two in your career so don't get\ndon't get too caught up on this uh the\nkey again is just to\nunderstand the main reason for a\nparticular framework so somebody will\ncome up with a framework and say I put\nout this framework because I want to\nsolve this particular\nproblem so understand that for maybe the\ntop three\nFrameworks maybe have a scattering of\nunderstanding of some of the uh\nsecondary Frameworks so that when you\ncome across a project you can make that\ndecision that being said if this is much\nmore important\nfor Freelancers or entrepreneurs where\nyou're developing an app and you have a\nlot a lot of control over decision\nmaking in terms of what JavaScript\ncomponents you might use or not use if\nyou're just getting a job look at the\njob market look what's available out\nthere so again do those three as I\nsuggested and then\nuh react view maybe angular if you want\nto work for Enterprise and understand a\nbit about node again don't spend too\nmuch time you don't want to be on\ntutorial H but just understand what's\ngoing on there and then when you start\nlooking for jobs uh as I say as I said\nin many videos study the prospective\nemployer look at what they're doing and\nBone up on whatever Technologies they\nneed from you so you find out their\nreact health and they use this that and\nthe other thing learn that reorient\nreorientate your resume to emphasize\nyour JavaScript skills don't be asked\nthough and then if you do get the\ninterview you can go in there with\nupto-date knowledge about whatever\nlibrary or whatever aspects of react or\nangular review that they happen to be\nusing and this will maximize your\nchances of uh getting a job in terms of\nthe tech end that all said apply to jobs\nuh where you have skills that align for\nthat job right so if you don't know\nanything about react and you start\napplying to for react\npositions probably not a good idea\n",
