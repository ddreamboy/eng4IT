  "text": "hello friends welcome to engineering\ntutorial\nso in the previous videos\nwe have discussed the basic introductory\nconcepts related to iot and the\ndesign of the iot network\nokay the various concepts basic concepts\nrelated to\nthat so\nthe basic definition of iot which we\nhave already\ncovered in the\ndesign aspects of the iot\nnetwork okay basically the\nphysical design it involves the\ncommunication\nprotocols okay the in the physical\ndesign\naspect which involves the\ndefining the things that are involved in\nthe iot network\nand the communication protocols the\ncommunication protocols\nthe which defines how the data exchange\nor sharing of information or data\nbetween the various devices that are\ninvolved in the network that happens in\nseveral layers\ni've already discussed that in the\nprevious video okay the design of the\niot networks i would please recommend\nyou to watch that video\nfirst the two videos which i posted you\nplease watch that and then\ncome to this so this uh\ncommunication it happens in several\nlayers\nokay at several levels\nso that is what is the topic of today's\ndiscussion okay the communication layers\nokay the levels\nso we all know the basic definition of\nthe iot let just\nlook at it in order to just be\nrefresh a certain things so basically\niot can be defined as a world of\ninterconnected\nthings where each and every thing\na simple electronic or electrical\napparatus appliance\nmachinery which is powered by electrical\nmeans\nit is connected to the internet okay\nfor sensing actuation monitoring\nprocessing control or simply\nto exchange or share data among the\nvarious\ndevices okay and everything\nhere is automated which means\nall of these things take place without\nminimal\nor no interference by the\nhuman beings okay so the main objectives\nof the iot which we have already\ndiscussed in the previous video it\ninvolves\nconnecting the various things that are\noperated through\nelectrical means device appliances\nmachines whatever\nto achieve exchange of data and\ninformation to share data and\ninformation among one another\nfor achieving these functions\nsensing processing controlling actuation\nmonitoring and to provide various\nvalue-based\nservices okay\nthe iot network design it involves two\naspects\nthe physical design and the logical\ndesign\nso the physical design of the iot\nthat involves two things\nthe things in iot which we have already\ndiscussed what those\nthings are it is anything which is\noperated through electrical means and\nhas a unique\nidentity defined by the ip address or\nurl link okay\nand it has the ability to\nsense remote sensing actuation\nmonitoring\ncontrol it should fit into one of these\nthings okay one of these objectives\neither it can it has sensing properties\nactuation properties monitoring\nproperties control\nprocessing whatever it should fit into\none of the\nthings one of the objectives\nthe second aspect is the communication\nprotocols now the communication\nprotocols\nin iot they define or they determine\nhow the data is shared\nor exchanged between the various devices\nand this\nthing happens at several\nlayers at several levels now i have\nalready posted a video related to\nopen system interconnection model in the\ncomputer networking and data\ncommunication\nsubject that section so you can please\ncheck out that video and i would\nrecommend you to watch all of those\nvideos\naround i think 15\naround videos are there you please check\nout those videos because it is\nit is very much related to this subject\nokay a lot of terms that we will be\nusing here\nthe in these basic uh introductory parts\nit has already been covered there those\nconcepts so you please watch\nwatch those videos first now this\nlayers or levels in which the\ncommunication takes place between\nthe various devices in the iot network\nthey are\nthe link layer the network or internet\nlayer\nthe transport layer and the application\nlayer\ngenerally there is a top two bottom or\nbottom to top\napproach that is used depending upon\nin which direction the data is being\nsent or which is the sending device\nwhich is the receiving device\nso generally the\niot layers are in this way link layer is\nat the bottom\nabove the link layer is the network or\ninternet layer\nabove that is the transport layer and\nfinally at the top\nis the application layer now each of\nthese\nlayers has a specific task a specific\nfunction which which which which\nfacilitates the exchange of data between\nthe two devices that are involved or the\ndevices that are\ninvolved in the communication process\nfirst the link layer the functions of\nthe iot layer so first is the link layer\nnow the link layer is mainly concerned\nwith the\nphysical medium okay connecting medium\nwhich is being used\nit can either be wired or wireless\nif it is wired it it depends on\nupon what type of wire it is what type\nof cable is used whether it is a twisted\npair cable\ncoaxial cable optical fiber and if it is\nwireless\nwhat wireless means is used okay\nin the electromagnetic spectrum which\nfrequency range is used microwave radio\nwave whatever\nokay it it involves determining the\ncharacteristic features\nassociated with the physically\nconnecting medium\nthat connects the two devices okay\nnow we'll be discussing about these\nthings in detail\njust here to give you an overall idea i\nhave just\ncovered it in short so the various\nexamples of\nthe link layer protocols that are used\nokay they are eight zero two\npoint three ethernet eight zero two\npoint one one which is the wi-fi\neight zero two point uh this is the y\nmax\n2g 3g 4g communication protocols\nso these are the examples of\nthe link layer protocols\nokay so these are the protocols that are\nused\nfor the uh\nwhich is related to the physical\ncharacteristics of the connecting medium\nnow here i would like to make a\ncorrection it is eight zero two point\none six which is the my y max\nby mistake i've written it one one okay\nit is uh y max is eight zero eight zero\ntwo point one six okay so\nthe next is the network or\ninternet layer now\nthis is the layer which is just above\nthe link layer\nnow the link layer is concerned with the\nphysical characteristics of the\nconnecting medium\nnow the internet layer or the network\nlayer\nthis is responsible for the\nsending and receiving of the\nip datagrams now what is this ip it is\nthe\ninternet protocol datagrams\nnow basically it is used for addressing\npurpose\nokay to determine the identity\nof the source and the destination device\nokay you know to identify which device\nis sending the data\nand to which device the data is being\nsent okay where to send the data\nso that is done achieved through the\ninternet protocol\ndatagrams or the ip datagrams which is\nhandled\nby the network or internet layer\nokay so the main objectives is the\naddressing\nor identification of the communicating\ndevices\nor the devices that are involved in this\nexchange of data the sending and\nreceiving of the data\nand the routing of the data packets\nrouting means to\nto send the data from the source device\nto the destination device it can be it\ncan take place\ndirectly or indirectly through various\nintermediary nodes\nuh so the various protocols network\nlayer protocols that are used are\nipv4 ipv6 6lowpan so basically it is\ninternet protocol version 4 internet\nprotocol version 6.\nso these are the short forms we'll be\ndiscussing about these protocols in\ndetail\nso now you just know that these are the\nnetwork layer protocols\nthen is the transport layer okay which\nis the layer above the\nnetwork or internet layer now\nthis layer it ensures\nthat the data or the information which\nis\nsent from the sending device or the\nsource it reaches\nthe destination it makes sure of that\nokay so that is what is referred to as\nend to end message transfer\ncapability okay so it can either be\nstateless\nor stateful now in stateless what me\nwhat i don't want into i don't want to\ngo into that because\ni have not described it here so\nbasically stateless means that\nonce the data is sent from the source\nwhether it reaches the destination or\nnot it does the the protocol has no\n[Music]\nrole to play in that but in stateful it\nmakes sure\nthat the data is which is being sent\nfrom the source it reaches the\ndestination\nonly then after receiving the data\nthe next data packet will be allowed to\nuh the next communication will be\nallowed to take place so that is\nto to explain it in simple way so\nthe transport layer it provides various\nservices such as error control\nit means any damaged data which is\nx which is received by the destination\nit will request\nfor to resend those data packets\nagain segmentation to divide the large\nbunch of data or large data information\nbunch\ninto several smaller packets then\nthe rate in which the data is being sent\nand received\nokay and the overcrowding of the data\npackets to control that so this is what\nerror control segmentation flow and\ncongestion control generally\nare an example of transport layer\nprotocols\nare transmission control protocol tcp\nand universal datagram protocol udp okay\nnow finally is the layer at the top\nwhich is the application layer\nnow the application layer it defines the\nrules regulations and protocols\nabout how a particular layer\ninteracts or is interfaced with the\nlayers that are below it\nokay how the various layers okay each of\nthese layers\nthey are interfaced with one another how\nthey communicate with\none another how the data flow will take\nplace that is governed by the\napplication layer so generally\nit performs data encoding which means\nconverting a data\nor any data audio video image\nanything into certain bit streams okay\nbit streams means a\nseries of binary bits zero\nand one zeros and ones that is what is\ncalled as\ndata encoding and process to process\ncommunication\nnow process to process communication\ni've already discussed in the\ncomputer networking and data\ncommunication section in detail so\nprocess to process communication\ngenerally refers to the\nthe program from which the data is\nsent to another program in the\ndestination device so that is basically\nwhat process to process\ncommunication is so here network\nsecurity comes into play cryptography\ncomes into play in the data encoding and\ndecoding\nuh concept so we will not go into\nthose things now so just you remember\nthat this is the\nfunction of the application layer the\nexample of the application layer is\nhttp protocol hypertext transfer\nprotocol which is used\nfor you can see hutp and whenever you\nlook at a particular url\nor website you will find this then\nwebsocket\ndata distribution service dds and many\nother protocols are there these are just\nto name a\nfew so here we have discussed\nthe various layers in which\nthe communication protocols\nthey function okay the link layer the\nnetwork or internet\nlayer the transport layer and the\napplication layer\nnow here we have just covered them in\nshort we'll be discussing about each of\nthese\nthings in detail so i hope you like this\nvideo\nand please subscribe my channel\nengineering tutorial for more such\nvideos related to electrical electronics\ninstrumentation and communication\nengineering\nhave a great day thank you very much\nyou\n",
