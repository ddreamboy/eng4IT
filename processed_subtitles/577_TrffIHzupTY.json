  "text": "[Music]\nso\n[Music]\nhi my name is professor don patterson\nand in this lecture i'd like to talk a\nlittle bit about the concept of\nubiquitous computing\nand how it leads into the idea of cloud\ncomputing\nkey points from this lecture are to\nrecognize that ubiquitous computing is a\nparadigm for people's relationship to\ncomputers\nabout the scale the invisibility and\nthen what results from the changes\nwhen we get a mobile-first kind of world\nso let's start with the idea of what is\nubiquitous computing let's give it a\ndefinition\nwe can start by looking at what the\ndefinition of ubiquitous is\nand from this dictionary entry we can\nsee that ubiquitous means present\nappearing or found everywhere and you\nmight use it in a\nsentence like the air is ubiquitous it's\nall around me\nor like the one here in the dictionary\ncowboy hats are ubiquitous among the\nmale singers\nokay in one sense then\nwhen we talk about ubiquitous computing\nwhat we mean is we mean a world in which\ncomputers are all around us\nthey're part of our daily routine we use\nthem when we're\ndoing work and when we're doing leisure\nwe use them to get places and we use\nthem when we\nare still at home and at work all the\ndifferent places where we are\nbut ubiquitous computing is also an\nacademic discipline as well\nso beyond just describing a kind of\ncomputing\nit also is a term that refers to a\nparticular line of research\nand that research started with an\narticle published in\nscientific american in 1991 called the\ncomputer for the 21st century\nby a guy named mark weiser he was\nworking at xerox park at the time\nand he was thinking about the ways in\nwhich technology was advancing\nlooking at the ways that different\nphilosophers had been thinking about\ntool usage\nand putting together a prediction about\nwhat the world was going to be like\nhis predictions were remarkably good\nconsidering they were made in 1991\ngood 25 years before the iphone came out\nand yet he was predicting a kind of\nmobile environment\nor a mobile computing\n[Music]\nworld that's very much like the one that\nwe have today\none of the things that he thought a lot\nabout was about ways of\nwaves of computing that go\nthrough different kinds of relationships\nthat people have with computers\nand as a good computer scientist i'm\ngoing to start with wave zero which is\none that wiser didn't really\ntalk about but which i think is\nimportant to point out and i would call\nthis one the zero wave of computer\ncomputing and this was the age of\ncomputerless computing\nand to give it a cut a rough timeline\nrough time frame i'd say that\nit was between about 1930 and 1940 when\nthis was\num happening at this point computers are\ntheoretical technology\nand individuals like church and alan\nturing\nestablished some fundamental limits on\ncomputability\nthey were kind a new kind of\nmathematician\nkind of mathematician that would\neventually become a computer scientist\nbut they existed at a time before there\nwas actually a physical computer around\nto work on\nand using some abstract ideas of what a\ncomputer would be like\nthey talked about some fundamental\nproblems like the p\nequals np problem or whether a class of\ncomputing problems called polynomial\ntime algorithms\nare really the same as another class of\nalgorithms called\ncalled non-deterministic polynomial time\nalgorithms\nthis question if p equals np remains one\nof the most foundational\ntheoretical theoretical problems that\nexist in computer science today\ni would say the zero wave of computing\nis a little bit like where we're at with\nquantum computing today\nwhile there are some small quantum\ncomputers and different approaches and\ndifferent organizations that are taking\nsteps\ntrying to create them there's a much\nricher set of research that has been\ndone\nthinking about what a quantum computer\ncould do if we had a fully featured\nquantum computer that was much larger\nthan a handful of\nqubits so the same way that we have sort\nof\nan idea of what a quantum computer might\nbe like if it is fully realized\nin the zero wave of computing the idea\nof what the cur the computers that we\nhave today\nare going to be like we're being decided\nof course we did end up with the\ncomputers that they were\nenvisioning so wiser introduced an idea\nof the first wave and the first wave\ncentered around mainframe computing\ngiving it a rough time frame about 1960\nto 1970\nand in this world there were massive\ncomputers doing simple data processing\nbut there were very few computers in the\nworld um here's a picture of a mainframe\nwith a dot ma\nit's with a printer i think it's a dot\nmatrix printer in front of it one of the\nmain ways in which you got output out of\nthese computers\nmany people use these computers so you\ncouldn't afford very many of them\norganizations like maybe government\nagencies or scientific agencies\nwould have them maybe a large\ncorporation might have them\nthey did relatively simple work by our\nstandards today\nin the military context they computed\nvarious kinds of ballistics tables\nin a business context they might have\ncomputed simple spreadsheets or\ndone accounting work and in scientific\nenvironments they might have been the\nfirst\nkinds of weather prediction sources of\nweather prediction at the time\nwell wiser indicated that this would be\nthe beginning and then predicted that\nthe second wave would come around\nthe second wave which we eventually came\nto know is desktop computing\nroughly the for the time frame from 1980\nto 1990\ntime when microsoft really came to the\nforefront as a massive global\ncorporation\nthat did computing what drove it were\nbusiness applications these were the\nprimary applications of the desktop\ncomputer\nand the vision would be would be that\nthere would be one computer per desk\nthis was focused on the business\nenvironment and desktop computers looked\na little bit like\nthis one here although this is a desktop\ncomputer at home so\npardon the slight mismatch in that way\nthese computers were connected in\nintranets and they were in a massive\nglobal network but\nthey weren't really in the internet as\nwe know it today mostly they were um\nintranets that were isolated from one\nanother they existed within particular\nacademic institutions or within\nparticular offices connecting the\ncomputers in those local areas\nwith maybe very small or if any\nconnections to the rest of the internet\nand all of these computers were wired\nthe idea of a wireless computer wasn't\nreally\na thing that was was entering the market\nat that point\neventually of course these computers\nmoved into the home environment where\nthey would be used for working from home\nand sometimes entertainment purposes\ngames\nmaybe learning educational context as\nwell\nwiser than said the third wave would be\nubiquitous computing as we know it today\nroughly from 2000 maybe to the present\ni'm not sure that we would say we've\ngone beyond the ubiquitous computing\nstage yet this is a stage of computing\nwhere\nit's not really business or government\napplications that are driving usage\nit's much more about information\ncreation information\naccess and communication that's driving\nthe usage\nso here's an example of third wave\ncomputing this is someone with a\nearly phone taking a picture of a lion\ntaking it to share it with someone else\nor maybe just for their own memory\nbut certainly not driven by a business\napplication trying to get some sort of\ncompetitive advantage\nin this world though we're starting to\nthink about the relationship between\ncomputers changing so there are multiple\ncomputers per environment or multiple\ncomputers per person\nterms like wan wide area network lan\nlocal area network\npan personal area network and ad hoc\nnetworking\ncame to the forefront and wireless\nnetworking was clearly\na direction that the computers were\ntaking at this point\nwhy is it predicted that computers would\nbegin to disappear\nnow when you first hear that you think\noh computer's disappearing that's\nbecause they're getting smaller yeah i\nget that\nand while wiser was certainly talking\nabout that in part\nhe was also talking about computers\ndisappearing in a very different way\nhe was talking about computers\ndisappearing uh from\nour awareness when we're using them so\nas an example you might think about\nsomething like\na hammer a hammer if you know how to use\none and it's functioning well\nyou don't really think about it when\nyou're using it to hammer in a nail\nyou act through that hammer to build\nyour\nbirdhouse or your house or whatever\nyou're trying to build or another\nexample\nis a car once you've learned how to\ndrive a car\nand you want to go somewhere you don't\nthink very much about the controls of\nthe car\nwhen you turn you turn the steering\nwheel but you're focusing mostly on\nwhere you're going when you want to go\nfaster you hit the accelerator when you\nwant to slow down you hit the brake\nbut those controls become an extension\nof your will and an extension of your\nbody\nas you move through the world as long as\nthe car is functioning okay and\nyou could just work through that those\nvehicle the vehicle or the hammer\nto accomplish what it is that you want\nto try and do\nin a similar way wiser anticipated that\nwe would begin to work through computers\nin this way\nthat we would stop thinking about the\nfact that we're using computers and we\nwould start just working through them\nand they would become tools that we\nbecome very naturally attuned to\nin many cases the kinds of things that\nwe do today maybe with\ninstagram or instant messaging or\ncomputing\nor communications we're still kind of\nvery aware that we're using computers so\nthey haven't exactly shifted seamlessly\ninto the background\nthose things are pretty obviously front\nand center yet\nthere are many computers that we\ninteract with on a daily basis where we\ndon't actually think very much about the\ncomputer\nthe car for example is cars modern cars\nare filled with all kinds of computing\ndevices appliances that we use are\nfilled with all kinds of\ncomputing devices maybe in some of our\nvoice enabled assistants\nlike alexa or siri or google home\nwe're beginning to get a sense we're\nbeginning to lose\nuh focus on the computer and we're\nstarting to be able to act naturally\nwith our computers and\nnot think so much about the technology\nthat's supporting it along the way\nwell the relationship to computers\nchanges in these each\neach of these waves in the zeroth wave\nthe relationship is just a thought\nexperiment people are thinking about\ncomputers\nin the first wave there are many people\nworking on one computer\nso a mainframe computer team of\ngovernment scientists\na team of corporate accountants all\nworking together on one computer in one\nparticular space\nin the second wave there's a one-to-one\nmapping\nbetween individuals and computers\ndesktop computing paradigm being the\npredominant way in the third wave we\nstart to get into a world that starts\nthat seems a little bit more familiar to\nthe one we're in now\nwhere one person has many different\ncomputers\nmaybe a phone maybe a smart watch maybe\na desktop maybe a server maybe a tv\nmaybe kind of sophisticated appliances\nmaybe you have a fancy\ninterface on your car and now one\nindividual has many\nmany different computers that they're\nmanaging\nthe relationship has changed in this\nthird wave\nanother thing that wiser brought out in\naddition to the relationship between the\npeople and the computers in terms of\nscale and also in terms of the\ninvisibility of the computers as they\ndropped to the background of our\nconsciousness as we were using them\nhe also wanted to draw a distinction\nbetween different kinds of computing\nthat even at the time were people were\nvery excited about that's the difference\nbetween ubiquitous computing and virtual\nreality\none thing about ubiquitous computing is\nthat when you do ubiquitous computing\nactions and when you're operating in\nthat kind of paradigm you're thinking\nabout\nthe devices adapting to the way in which\nwe live our life\nso here's an example of a phone and just\nin a very simple example\nas you turn the phone 90 degrees so it\ngoes from portrait to landscape mode\nthe screen layout changes this is a\nreally simple example but it's a way in\nwhich the computer is aware of its\nenvironment and it adapts\nto the way that we're moving through the\nworld likewise as this is a mapping\napplication\nif that dot presumably is where i am\nit's also responding to my location\nand it's changing the way in which it's\ndisplaying that information\nin order to react to the world now a\nproper ubiquitous computing\napplication would take some kind of\naction on behalf of the user when\nthey're in a\nparticular space and have indicated a\nneed for some kind of\ncomputational support this is just\ndisplaying the location rather than\nactually doing anything in particular\nnow on the other side though is virtual\nreality this is an example of someone\nusing virtual reality gear\na headset that's covering their complete\nvision gloves that have haptics in it\nthrough which they can control objects\nin the virtual\nworld and receive feedback and what is\nit that they're experiencing\nwell they might be looking at a virtual\nworld like this virtual world from\nopen simulator created by users\ncompletely\ncovering the field of view of the\nindividual and the user can move through\nit\nbut they have to be careful because it's\nvery easy to forget that you're\nconnected to this gear and if you move\ntoo fast you might\npull a wire or if you're in a more\nmobile environment\nyou might hit a real wall as you try and\nwalk through the virtual environment\nand don't see an actual don't see a\nvirtual wall where the real wall is\na third kind of thing like virtual\nreality is something that i would call a\nmirror world\na mirror world is something maybe more\nlike google earth or google maps\nwhere a virtual world is constructed\nthat's designed to mirror the real world\nso that you can enter into the mirror\nworld and use it as a proxy\nfor exploring the real world in some way\nmaybe for directions\nmaybe to get a view of what a different\nlocation is like\nmaybe to experience the landscape or\nreal estate or something along those\nlines for\na google map view these are two\ndifferent very\ndifferent ways of thinking about\ninteracting with computing but then\nthere in the middle is augmented reality\naugmented reality is a little of both\nsides and maybe we could think of this\nas being the boundary between ubiquitous\ncomputing and virtual reality\nwhat happens with augmented reality is\nyou use some sort of device and you hold\nit up and a camera on the one side of\nthe device\ntakes a picture of the world in front of\nyou and shows you what you could simply\nsee if you didn't have the camera in\nfront of you\nbut the benefit of looking at the\ndisplay is that the computer\nthe phone in this case can overlay the\nthe view on the camera\nwith information relevant to the view\nthat you're experiencing\nso in this case the application is\nlocation aware and as you look at\ndifferent\nthings in your immediate environment it\nwill overlay it with icons\nrecommendations and information about\nthe places that you're viewing\nkind of a mix between virtual reality\nand ubiquitous computing in that way\nnow the key thing about these two\nparadigms and the way that\nwiser differentiated them was that\nubiquitous computing was really about\ncomputers entering the humans world\ncomputers getting out of the office and\nout of the labs and\nand starting to understand the world the\nsensing\nthe temperature the experiences that the\nhuman was having and\nadapting to that virtual reality in\ncontrast\nis a human entering into the computer's\nworld\naccepting all of the input and sensory\nexperience that the computer wants to\ngenerate\nthe human then reacts to the computer\ninstead of the computer reacting to the\nhuman\ndifferent applications for both sides\nbut also different ideas\nabout what these kinds of paradigms of\ncomputing were\nor are all right so\nwhat's next what's next with our\nrelationship with computers\nwiser really only saw ubiquitous\ncomputing as being\nthe third wave it didn't really talk\nmuch about what the next phase might be\none thing that's clear is that there are\ngoing to be more and more computers\nand that the relationship between people\nand computers might not be quite so\ndistinct it might not be that computers\nare discretely\nowned by one particular individual you\nmight have\na home tv for example that's owned by\nmultiple people\nor you might have phones that you share\ncomputers that you swap or different\naccounts so that now\nthe ability to find these relationships\nbetween different\ncomputers and different people becomes a\nlot more muddied a lot more difficult to\nassociate\nthe computing resources with particular\nindividuals\nand a real difficult question is how are\nwe going to manage all of these devices\nhow are we going to keep track of them\nhow are we going to do work with them\non top of that there's a whole lot of\nmaintenance that has to be done\nhow are we going to keep them operating\nhow are we going to keep the software up\nto date\nhow are we going to make sure that the\nnetworks are working how are we going to\nmanage all of that infrastructure\nwell this is something that i think is\nreally drives us into cloud computing\nthis requires professionals and what\nkind of professionals will professionals\nthat run\ncloud computing infrastructures\ncompanies like amazon web services\nand apple computer businesses that are\neager to\nfind a way to provide value to different\nusers and help them navigate\nthis complex digital environment\nso the key points from this lecture are\nthat ubiquitous computing is really a\nparadigm started by mark weiser in the\n1990s\nthat described people's relationships to\ncomputers\non the one hand it talked about scale\ntalked about the scale of\nindividuals to number of computers so\none many people to one computer one to\none\nand then many computers to one person it\nalso talked about the scale of the\ncomputer in terms of its physical size\nare you working with a big computer or\nsmall computers mentioned in his vision\nas well\nhe also talks about invisibility of\ncomputers yes getting physically smaller\nbut more importantly\nbecoming the in\nmoving into the background of our\nconsciousness as we work through them\nas as we stop to recognize that we're\nactually using computers to get work\ndone and then finally he talked a lot\nabout what was what's going to result\nfrom those changes\nand one of the things that we've seen is\nthat cloud computing is a valuable tool\nfor trying to manage\nthis trajectory going forward\nthanks for listening to this short\nlecture on ubiquitous computing an\nacademic discipline that i've done a lot\nof work in\nand how it leads into the current world\nthat we're experiencing\nwith cloud computing services being\noffered to us\nfrom a variety of different companies\nthank you\n[Music]\nyou\n",
