  "text": "jQuery is a library that contains lots\nof methods which make it much easier to\nmanipulate HTML documents ad animation\nalong with a bunch of other things since\njQuery is a library it has an API that\nwe can use to access its functionality\nAPI stands for application programming\ninterface and it basically States the\nmethods or functions we can call inside\nof our code if we import the library for\nexample let's say we had a class named\nBlue and made its elements have blue\ntext we could use the add class me\nmethod and add the blue class to all the\nP elements with something similar to\nthis where we'd have p. addclass blue\nthis may be confusing right now but\ndon't worry we'll figure it out to start\nwe'll open Sublime and create an\nindex.html file so we'll go index. HTML\nand then we'll also create a script.js\nfile and so we'll save this and we'll\nput it in a folder called JS and so\nwe'll have that and then we'll call this\nscript.js and this will hold all of our\nJavaScript and our query code and so\ngoing back to our HTML we'll just add\nsome boiler plate\nhere and we'll add a quick script tag\nhere with JS\nscript.js close it up here and just like\nwe did for our bootstrap we're going to\nneed to import the JavaScript library\nand so we'll go and look up the link\njQuery link and then add that into our\ncode\nhere scrolling down we have the CDN this\nis what we want and since we're going to\nbe using jQuery in our script file we're\ngoing to want to import this jQuery\nfirst save that and then we'll add a\nheader inside of our body we'll call it\nan H1 and we're going to set some\nstyling to that and so basically we're\ngoing to create this hidden header and\nwe're going to do some stuff to it and\nso we'll have the style equal text align\nCenter putting it in the center and\nwe'll give it the color white so it's\nwhite text and it's hidden on you know\nthis page page with a white background\nthen we'll give it the ID hidden and\nwe'll have the text be I was\nhidden and then close that each one now\nif we open this index.html in the web\npage here we are you'll see nothing's\nthere but if I highlight I was hidden\nthat's there what if we can make it so\nwhen I hover over this H1 this ey was\nhidden it reveals itself so maybe it\nturns the text of this header black well\nwe can do this with CSS and jQuery and\nso going back to our code we'll go to\nour script and we're going to write some\njQuery code using you know its libraries\nits methods here we go we'll say\ndocument. ready function open close\ncurly bracket and so basically what will\nhappen is this the inside of this thing\nwill be called when the document is\nready to you know load stuff it's all\nready to go and so what we'll do is\nWe'll add some code to be run once you\nknow this document is ready to go and so\nwe'll say hashtag hidden. hover function\nopen close parenthesis open close curly\nbracket and what this does is if I like\nhover over the thing with the ID hidden\nthe code inside of this will be run and\nso basically this is setting up like hey\nif I hover over hidden like do this\nother stuff that's here and so what\nwe'll want to do is if we hover over our\nheader that has the ID hidden we'll want\nto select that hidden you know element\nand we'll want to say this you know this\nhidden element we're going to change it\nCSS and we're going to set the color\nproperty equal to Black so now you can\nactually see this hidden thing and so\nwhat happens when I you know go away\nfrom the thing so I move my mouse so\nit's no longer hovering over this hidden\nelement while we'd want a place where we\ncan add code that could be run you know\nonce I move over my mouse and so this\nwould be a call back function and so\nonce I stop stop hovering over you know\nthis hidden thing then I would want this\ncall back function to be called and so\nhere we go we're running it function\nopen close parenthesis this is what\nwould be run if I stop hovering over\nthis hidden thing and so we don't want\nanything to happen just yet and so we'll\nleave that call back function empty but\nit's important you have it and then\nwe'll add these semicolons save it up\nmake sure this is saved and then we'll\ngo ahead and refresh our index.html\nand we hovered over it and now it's\nhidden but of course when it doesn't\nre-hide itself once I stop hovering over\nit but what if we wanted it to do that\nwell we could go back to our code and we\ncould actually hide it forever it was\none thing to make the text white but if\nwe go this do hide open close\nparenthesis and then add that semicolon\nsave now when I refresh this I'll hover\nover it and then I'll leave it but now\nwhen I try to find it again it's gone so\nit's like a j Bond you know your message\nself-destructs type of thing but of\ncourse if I refresh the page I you know\nsaw it for like 2 seconds and then it\nhit again and then you can do it again\nyou keep it over this you go away there\nyou go back in our code the hide\nfunction basically hides this element by\nsetting the display property to none and\nso you could accomplish this same you\nknow hide thing if we did display none\nbut of course this is you know less code\nand so we use that instead so we'll go\nahead and comment that out and if we go\nback to our index.html we'll do one more\nexample of how to use jQuery and so if\nwe add this button and we'll say alert\nme button you know save that up and\nwe'll say button doclick function open\nclose parenthesis open close curly\nbracket and so what will happen here is\nif I click the button any button on the\npage it doesn't have to be one specific\nbutton then this type of code will be\nrun if I wanted it to work for one\nspecific button I would do something\nsimilar to this where I'd have a hashtag\nyou know name so would be an ID so\nthat's only for one thing versus this is\na button it's an HTML element so any\nbutton I click this will be run and so\ninside of here we'll you know send out\nan alert because our button says alert\nme and so we'll go\nalerts I'm alerting you that's what the\nalert is going to do we'll save that go\nback here here we have this button we\nclick it it alerts me could we have done\nthis with plain vanilla JavaScript yes\nbut using the jQuery Library makes a lot\nof this much easier to code and easier\nto read later on next week we'll talk\nabout angularjs which is a structural\nJavaScript framework that helps you\nbuild Dynamic web apps for the first\ntime in the series we will not be\nhardcoding our content but we'll be\ngetting it from somewhere else I hope\nyou learned something in this week's\nepisode and I'll see you next Friday\n",
