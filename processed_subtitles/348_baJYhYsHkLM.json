  "text": "hey what up guys welcome back to my\nchannel and today I have a very special\nvideo for you that I think many of you\nwill enjoy because we will namely be\nbuilding a block chain in under 15\nminutes because I want to demonstrate to\nyou guys that block chain in itself is a\nvery simple concept it's a very simple\ndata structure at its core of course\ncryptocurrencies are complicated but the\nblockchain is not the reason they are\ncomplicated the reason why they're\ncomplicated is the consensus algorithm\nit's the mining is the transactions is\neverything that is around but blockchain\nin itself is very easy to understand but\nyou need to know what you need to know\nbefore you can actually understand what\nblockchain is and how it works you need\nto know what hashes are and you need to\nknow how they work and so a hash is\nbasically a digital signature of of some\nkind of data so for example I can take a\nmovie and I can hash it and get a\ndigital signature I can take an email\nand I can hash it and get a digital\nsignature I can take a word and they can\nhash it I can take a whatever data you\njust take it you hash it and you get the\ndigital signature for that data so\nbefore we start with the actual\nblockchain let me just demonstrate it to\nyou how this works so we will be\nbuilding our blockchain in Java it will\nbe very simple and you if you know\nprogramming you can do that in another\nlanguage and if you don't know\nprogramming I think you still will be\nable to understand roughly how this\nworks so let's let's talk about hashes\nas we can see us we have two lists we\nhave one list that contains ABC and we\nhave a second list that also contains a\nB and C so this this is the data this is\nbasically the strings we're trying to\nhash so let's see what kind of what kind\nof digital signature we will get from\nlist 1 and what kind of so we will just\nprint the digital signature or the hash\nwhenever you hear hash guys you can just\nthink you can replace hash with digital\nsignature so let's see what kind of\noutput we get if we print the Dignitas\ndigital signature of a and\nsignature of at least one and digital\nsignature of least two so as you can see\nas we get these two numbers and digital\nsignatures are identical for these two\nlists if I now change anything in list\ntwo for example and I run it again you\nsee that I get a completely different\ndigital signature so if I just make a\nsmall amendment I just meddle with the\ndata I try to change anything in this\nlist I will get a completely different\ndigital signature and that is the\nfoundation of a blockchain because a\nblockchain is a list of blocks basically\na chain of blocks and each block holds\nthe digital signature of the previous\nblock and the digital signature of the\nnext block is based upon the digital\nsignature of the current block so they\nare always together the next signature\nwill be based on the current signature\nand the current signature is based on\nthe previous signature so if you change\nanything back back in the past you will\nbreak all of the signatures they will\nlook completely different and I'm trying\nto adjust the lighting I should get some\nkind of artificial light so I don't need\nto to reduce the window as the light\nsource okay so now that we understand\nwhat digital signatures are hashes and\ndigital signatures is basically the same\nworld and how you use them let's\nactually get into our blockchain coding\nand let's see if I can make it under 15\nin under 15 minutes so the first thing\nwe need to do is talk about our block\nour block in this case will be very\nsimple it will only contain three things\nit will contain the list of transactions\nthat happened in that block it will\ncontain the previous hash the hash or\nthe digital signature of the previous\nblock and it will also contain the hash\nof the current of of itself and this\nhash will be based on the transactions\nand the previous hash so if anyone would\nchange anything in the previous block\nthe digital signature of the current\nblock will change\nand when that changes the digital\nsignature of the next block will change\nyou will see how this works very soon\nguys so let me just remove this this\nclass that I played around with earlier\nlet me see let me delete and let's start\nfrom scratch and we will create a new\nclass and it will be the block so I'm\ndoing it in Java you can do it in\nwhatever language you want it's\nbasically a simple and simple stuff so\nlet's create the fields it will have the\nprevious hash it will have the let me\nsee it will have the previous hash and\nit will have the transactions list of\ntransactions so I'm just making a a an\narray of strings so each transaction\nwill be a string in this case of course\nin in a real block chain the\ntransactions would be their own objects\nand we will need to create a object for\nthat and define a class and all of that\nbut we're just playing around let's just\ncreate let's just create them as strings\nso and each block will also have a its\nown hash and this hash will be based on\nall the transactions let me just define\nand the array on which we will base the\nhash so we first of all need to\ncalculate the hash of the transactions\ntransactions let me add an S here and s\nhere and an S here and here and also\nhere\nso we we will calculate the current hash\nbased on the hash of all of the\ntransactions and the previous hash like\nthis and so the block hash will be the\ndigital signature all the hash however\nyou want to call it of contents and\ncontents are the hash of the\ntransactions that are in this block and\nthe previous hash the hash of the\nprevious block so if I change anything\nin the transactions or if I change\nanything in the transactions in the\nprevious block or anything in these\ntransactions in the block before the\nprevious block\nthis hash will be completely different\nand here you also need to change okay\nvery good guys we have finished our blog\nlet's create the blockchain an ArrayList\nof blocks so it's basically an array of\nblocks and ArrayList is just easier to\nwork with\nlet's see blockchain and it will be\ninteresting new ArrayList like this so\nwe need to create orogenesis block\nbecause each block chain needs a Genesis\nblock that is hard-coded\nthe reason is because as you can see as\neach block has the hash of the previous\nblock however the Genesis block is the\nfirst block so it has no previous block\nso we need to hard code how it looks\nlike so Genesis let's call it Genesis\nblock it will be a new block and let's\nsee what kind of things it needs a\nprevious hash which we don't have and it\nneeds transactions so let's just let's\njust make fake transactions here Tran\nGenesis transactions transactions and\nthey are equal to for example let's say\nSatoshi cent Ivan 10 Bitcoin so I'm just\nwriting the transactions as strings of\ncourse in a real blockchain this would\nbe some other data structure probably\nsome kind of transaction class but for\nsimplicity let's just let's just write\nthem as strings send ten bitcoins to\nIvan so everyone is sending me Bitcoin\nin this Genesis block so I add it like\nthis\nso guys now we can actually output the\nget block hash let's see I need we need\nto create a getter for the block hash so\nnow we can actually output now come on\nyes now we can actually output the\ndigital signature of the block we just\ncreated block hash let's see what it\nlooks like so as we can see I get this\nnumber\nthere is a negative mind\nsomething so this is a digital signature\nof this block that we just created now\nif I change anything at all in this\nblock let's say that I want I want to\ncheat the system and I suddenly say that\nSatoshi sent me a million Bitcoin or\nlike 100,000 Bitcoin and if I run this\nnow we will see that the digital\nsignature is completely different and\nthis is very important because when we\ncreate our second block let's say block\nlet's create our second block it will\nneed the first of all it will need the\nprevious hash it will need the hash of\nthe previous block and that is the\nGenesis block blockchain hash and it\nwill need some kind of transactions I\nsee let's say that block two\ntransactions let's say that in the\nsecond block\nIvan sent ten Bitcoin to Satoshi I sent\nhim back his bitcoins and Satoshi sent\nten Bitcoin to Starbucks like this so\nthese are the transactions in the second\nblock so yes as you can see if I put the\ntransactions and we output now the\ndigital signature of the second block\nlet's just do like this hash of block\ntwo hash of Genesis block so now we can\nactually output the hash of block 2 and\nthe Genesis block something is ok I\nforgotten you\nlet's see let me shrink myself here so\nas we can see hash of the Genesis block\nis this number\nHacha block - is this number now yes\nhere is the interesting part that if I\nchange anything in block 1 for example\nlet's say I suddenly say that Satoshi\nsend me this many bitcoins and they run\nit you will see that these numbers would\nbe completely different as you can see\nthe hash of Genesis block is completely\ndifferent and the hash of the second\nlock is completely different and so this\nis the basic foundation of the\nblockchain that if I change anything\nback here the next block will get a\ncompletely different signature and that\nis because we're passing the previous\nhash and group and we are calculating\nthe current hash based on the previous\nhash and these transactions so if I\nchange anything in the past the\ntransactions will be different the hash\nof the transactions will be different\nand this change will propagate through\nthe blockchain and so let's just create\na third block like this let's say block\n3 transactions and block 3 and now we\nhave the previous hash will be block 2\nblock 2 and the transactions will be\nblock three transactions and let's say\nthat in this block I will I sent one\nBitcoin to my mom like this or let's\ngive her this many bitcoins and if I get\nthe digital signature of that let's see\nblock 3 like this and we'll run it I get\nthe following I get the following\nsignatures so I just want to demonstrate\nnot to you guys now that if I change\nanything in the first block let's say\nthat I add this a I just change it\nchange anything in these strings in\nthese strings as you can see it's\ncompletely different the signatures in\nall of these steps and this this hashing\nalgorithm is\nis very hard to crack and the more\nblocks are created on top of of the of\none block the transactions in that block\nare more and more confirmed because it's\nharder and harder to crack all of these\nhashes because the previous hash will be\nbased on the hash before that and the\ncurrent hash will be based on the\nprevious hash and so as you can see a\nchange in any of these transactions in\nany of the data in the one block will\npropagate and change all of the digital\nsignatures in the future and that is how\nabduction works because if I change\nsomething everyone else will see that my\ndigital signatures are completely\ndifferent from everyone else's so that\nmeans that I have cheated so if I just\ntell everyone that hey Satoshi gave me\nthis many bitcoins back back then and\nhere is the blockchain that that\nconfirms that everyone will take a look\nat it and say well I will know this\nblockchain doesn't confirm that because\nwe have our own versions of the\nblockchain and the digital signatures\nare completely different so guys I hope\nyou enjoyed I hope you understood the\nbasic concepts of hashing of of linking\nblocks together via their digital\nsignatures or the hashes and if you are\nnew viewer and you like blockchain\ntechnology theorum programming software\ndevelopment you should definitely\nsubscribe to this channel guys because\nyou will find it interesting I myself am\na software developer and I'll see you\nguys tomorrow I hope you really know how\nblockchain works and how the concepts\nbehind it have a good day guys goodbye\n",
