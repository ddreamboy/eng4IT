  "text": "your company generates lots of data but\nthe business outcomes you gain from that\ndata can be largely affected by data\nquality\nto use an analogy imagine you're a chef\nand you have the highest accolades in\nthe industry a highly experienced team\nbut when the ingredients come in those\nare poor quality ingredients picture\nrotten tomatoes rotten onions so when\nyou go and make those entrees the end\nresult is poor quality and your\nrestaurant's reputation suffers\nthis is the same impact that poor data\nquality can have on your business\ncausing your company's reputation to\nsuffer as a result\nthere are a lot of different factors\nthat can impact data quality such as the\nnumber of sources or the size of your\ncompany but today i want to talk about\nfour main qualities within data itself\naccuracy unit completeness consistency\nand uniqueness\nand i'm going to talk about them through\nthe lens of a lead generation company\nstarting with accuracy\naccuracy is about the current state of\nyour data versus reality\nso for my lead generation company\nimagine i'm driving traffic to a website\nand all of a sudden i get a sudden spike\nin usage from bots that hit the click\ngeneration\nif i don't account for this spike when i\ngo and pull that data at the end of the\nday it's not going to reflect reality so\nit's not going to be accurate\nnext i want to talk about completeness\nwhich is about how you have filled out\nall the required fields\nin your data set\nso let's say i'm launching a survey\ncampaign\nand i'm collecting\nnames and email addresses\nbut i don't require this field so when i\ngo and pull that data i notice that some\nof my participants didn't put their name\nsome of my participants didn't put their\nemail so when i go and pull that picture\nof the client of the customer i have an\nincomplete data set and a complete\npicture\nnext we talk about consistency which is\nabout how uniform\nyour data set is throughout different\ndata sources\nso back to my lead generation example\nlet's say i'm driving traffic for a drop\nshipping campaign\nand i have my procurement team\ncollecting zip codes and my marketing\nteam collecting zip codes but my\nprocurement team is looking at them\nin a five digit format while my\nmarketing team is collecting them in a\nnine digit format\nwhen i go tap into both of these\ndatabases and pull the customer profile\nit might be incomplete because those zip\ncodes don't match up throughout my\nsystems\nand lastly there's uniqueness which is\nlargely tied to the number of duplicates\ni have in a data set\nso in my lead generation context you can\nimagine having 50 000 leads at the end\nof the year but when i actually go into\nthose leads i realize that 20\nare duplicates from customers who filled\nout the information previously so now\nwhen i go and pull that report i\nactually have 20 percent less data and a\nlot\nless\npositive looking picture for my company\nso\nlooking at these aspects it's easy to\nthink wow there's a lot of manual\ninspection here how can i go through all\nof my data and understand these\nresources these\nqualities right well you can actually\nleverage machine learning and ai to\nautomatically sense these key features\nas data enters your system saving you\ntime and manual inspection\nif you're curious about these ai\nfeatures check out the links below and\nif you're curious about technology\nsubscribe to the channel thank you\n",
