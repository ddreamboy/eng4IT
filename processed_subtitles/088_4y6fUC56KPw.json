  "text": "hello and welcome back to data science\nWednesday my name is Tessa Jones and I'm\na data scientist with decisive data and\ntoday we're going to talk about\npredictive analytics and what it can do\nfor you\npredictive analytics fits into the\nspectrum of analytics that we've talked\nabout before starting with descriptive\nwhich is the most basic of the analytics\nit is basically just cleaning relating\nsummarizing and visualizing your data\nreally getting to the questions about\nwhat's happening in my business and then\nthere's diagnostic which is really\ngetting down to why things are happening\nwhat's causing my revenue to decline or\nto increase how are things related\nthings like that so if you've got a good\nbase in both of these then we're ready\nto move into predictive analytics which\nis gonna dive into what's gonna happen\nin the future which is super powerful if\nyou're a business person and you want to\nbe able to make good business questions\nif you have at least an idea of what\nmight happen in the future your your\nanswers are already gonna be a little\nbit better so let's dive in so let's go\nwith an example cuz that just makes it\neasier to kind of flow through what's\nactually happening here so let's pretend\nthat we are grocery store owners and if\nwe're already talking about predictive\nanalytics you should have a pretty good\ngrasp on descriptive and predictive and\ndiagnostic analytics so you probably\nalready have a decent dashboard that\nreally tells you what's happening in\nyour business right now so something\nlike this where you have you know\nsomething here that tells you revenue by\ndifferent departments like foods meats\nor foods and pastry or how your sales\nchanges by product or overtime things\nlike that so you have an idea of what's\nhappening in your business but now you\nreally want to know what's going to\nhappen in my business so one really\ncommon question is how many of a given\nproduct am I going to sell for every\nstore because this can really give you\nquite answer questions around how you're\ngoing to support supply chain processes\nor how you're going to manage the\nprofits that you're going to have things\nlike that so the first thing we need to\ndo is talk about what happened\npast we really can't do anything or\npredict very easily unless we know or at\nleast have an idea of what's happened in\nthe past so here we have three lines in\nblack that represent basically\nhistorical data each line here is one\nyear worth of sales for a given product\nand then the green line here is the\ncurrent year and here's today and if we\nbuild a predictive model it's going to\ntell us what's going to happen for the\nrest of the year so if this is all set\nup and we build a model basically we mix\nthis information with all the data\nthat's really clean and well-organized\nwe mash it together with a bunch of\nmathematics and coding and basically we\npop out some results and it shows up in\na visual like this where you have these\nare the cells that we have had and these\nare the cells that we think we're going\nto have so a business person can look at\nthis chart and say wow we need to put a\nlot more products to this store because\nI see sales are going to increase or our\nprofit margins are going to be way\nhigher than we thought so we can start a\nnew program things like that you can\nreally start to get innovative with your\nbusiness decisions so let's pretend\nwe've built this model and it's been\nrunning for a year and now we want to\nknow how well is this model actually\nperforming so down here we have a chart\nthat shows in black what we actually\nsold and then in green what we thought\nwe were going to sell and we see that\nthere's some a couple of pretty big\nmisses right here we sold way more than\nwe thought we would which leaves risk to\nyou know missing out on inventory or\nhere we predicted we would sell more way\nmore than we did so both of these are\nkind of misses and so we need to go back\nand look at the data and understand what\nassumptions we we applied that we're\nmaybe a little bit wrong or applied\nincorrectly or look at the data maybe we\nweren't accounting for something and we\nkind of reorganize that and incorporate\nit into the model and then we redeploy\nit and then the then we have a better\nmodel this cycle can you know happen a\ncouple times or it can happen many\nit really depends on the data it really\ndepends on the objective it depends on a\nlot of different things but we do try to\nminimize the number of times that we're\nhaving to iterate through this before we\ncan have a really sound predictive model\nso that's predictive analytics in a\nnutshell basically once you have a solid\nfoundation of descriptive and diagnostic\nanalytics we can really start pushing\nforward with predictive analytics and\nthen next week we're going to start\ntalking about prescriptive analytics\nwhich really gets to the questions of\nokay now that we know what's happening\nin the future what do we do about it I'm\nTessa Jones and that's a reindeer\n",
