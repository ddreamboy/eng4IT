  "text": "Hi I'm Gary. Sentiment analysis, part \nof natural language programming or NLP,  \nis very common very popular, and a very powerful \ntool. For example we can see the sentiment the  \npositive or negative sentiment of someone when \nthey interact with a help desk many help desks  \nuse NLP to see how their customers interact \nwith their staff and their staff interact  \ncustomers also social media, we might be able \nto tell how positive or negative people are  \ntalking about our brand but let me show you how \nsimple it is to do sentiment analysis in Python\nfirst of all on my screen you're going to see my \ndata these are media releases I'm going to create  \nsentiments analysis on these media releases these \nare media releases from various state governments  \nin Australia over the last few years Health \nmedia releases health related media releases  \nso I'm going to look at the sentiment of \nthis text column okay I've got State I've  \ngot the date I've got very it's a few years it's \nseveral thousand rows it's not a huge data set  \nso what I'm wanting to get to what I'll show \nwhat we'll get to so that's what I'm going to  \nanalyze for sentiment I want to know how positive \nand negative every one of these media releases  \nare every single one of these rows so just to \nshow you where we're actually going with this  \nwe're going to get to here so you'll notice \nit's the same as before that's the text I'm  \ngoing to analyze that text column and we \ncan get we can see whether it's positive  \nor negative now the various things that happen \nin this analysis it gives a positive score how  \npositive or what it is each each of these text \nrows for example how neutral or how negative  \nis it and a compounded or an overall score \nso generally we would look at this overall  \nscore so for example anything above zero zero to \none would be positive and anything from zero to  \nminus one would be negative so here you can see \nthat's minus 0.8 so that's a negative sentiment  \num critical workers from certain sectors sectors \nisolating as close contacts will be and on it goes  \nso that was deemed as negative and so on so let's \nsee how we do this I'm going to go across two  \nJupiter notebook I do have if you haven't used \nJupiter before if you need to install python I  \ndo have a a tutorial and I'll leave I'll create \na link for that also the script I'm running uh  \nin this video I will in the description of the \nvideo I'll create a link where you can copy this  \num uh sorry this the script and use it if \nyou if you want to so we're going to run this  \nlet me just go through What's Happening Here \nso we're saying first thing we're going to do  \nis import NLTK that's an NLP or natural language \nprogramming package in Python we're going to be  \nusing the VADER lexicon. VADER is what does the \nsentiment analysis which is part of the NLTK and  \nwe're going to use Pandas so good old Pandas which \nif you're a data scientist or data analyst you  \nyou probably use Pandas a lot if you use Python \nit creates data frame or we can work with data  \nframes let's put it that way so we're going to \nload up the CSV file into the Pandas data frame  \nI'm then going to do a little bit of work \non it for example I'm going to drop in now  \nor drop all columns all with a date column is \nempty I'm going to drop those I just want to  \nget rid of those empty empty columns that's just \nsomething that's probably a good practice to do  \nand then also going to define the various \ndata types you don't necessarily need to  \ndo this but I will just to show you so I've got \na date column a text column and a state column  \ndate is day text is text or a string \nand a state is actually categorical\nin Pandas particularly if you're working \nif you're a researcher for example and  \nworking with large data sets several \nmillion rows for example that would  \ndestroy Excel for example you're going to use \nfar less memory if you define the data types  \ngenerally what happens is using Pandas \nit Imports the data as an object type  \nsome string and you'll notice that you will have \nme or you may well have memory problems but if  \nyou define the data types your memory usage \nwill go down so I've just gotten the habit of  \ndoing it so I'm going to do it in this case you \ndon't need to do it with smaller lots of data  \nso let me just run this and we should see because \nI've said here print the head show the first few  \nin the last few rows we can see here um I've got \nit's not quite Lan but date I've got text and  \nI've got State okay so I've loaded it up now we're \ngoing to create that magic we're going to run that  \nsentiment analysis and create those extra fields \nin my Excel file CSV file saver to a CSV file  \nso I'm going to go through it very very quickly \nwe're going to load up the analyzer we're then  \ngoing to create three sorry four different columns \ncompound negative neutral and positive and VADER  \nis going to calculate that for us the different \nscores based on the text column in our data\num my different columns I'm going to create \nas well a sentiment column because I want to  \njust summarize these so what I'm going to say \nis if the positive score is greater than 0.5\nthen make it positive sorry if the sentiment \nscore is greater than 0.5 add positive into  \nthe sentiment field if in the sentiment field the \ncompound value is less than 0. negative 0.05 then  \nadd negative it's just a very quick way of then \nseeing positive and negative scores and we'll  \njust print it out to the screen and we'll save \nit to a CSV file ending in demo.csv just so I  \ncan show you that it's done so let's run this now \nthis does take a little bit of time to run for the  \namount of data that I have which is um uh uh 2000 \n204 rows it'll take I'm guessing three minutes or  \nso on my computer which is pretty slow if you have \nseveral million uh rows it'll obviously take a lot  \nlonger it's quite a complex thing but I'll get \nback as soon as this is finished we'll carry on  \nokay so the sentiment analysis or the script \nhas now run and you can see here I've printed to  \nthe screen the first value there 52 is there 52 \nneutral comments 1572 positive and 580 negative  \nso in general the media releases at the health \ndepartments in in these uh in the data that I have  \nwere inherently mostly positive but let's go now \nto that CSV file and just make sure that it's into  \nthe data as we expected so going across to that \nfile this is the one there I'll just open that up  \nwe'll just wait for that to load up and Excel\nI'll just make a little bit bigger so \nwe can see so there my column here is  \nr and you'll notice that now it's added \nthe compound negative neutral positive  \nand the general sentiment of course now you \ncould create a chart if you want to in Excel  \nor even using python but please subscribe to \nmy Channel please like this video.
