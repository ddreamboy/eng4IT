  "text": "okay so we are live and ready to go for\nour tutorial today and this is going to\nbe a very gentle introduction to\nprincipal component analysis in\ncytometry for dummies so yeah again\nwelcome to today's tutorial my name is\nromg sason and if you are interested in\nplaying along at home you can play\naround with the demo data set at app.\ntake.\nbio so again today's tutorial is about\nprincipal component analysis in\ncytometry for dummies like me and this\nis going to be a very gentle\nintroduction to a very powerful tool and\njust as a reminder our mission at too is\nto make high parameter or high\ndimensional cytometry simple and easy\nfor cl IAL\ntrials so who might care about today's\ntopic it's anybody who wants to find the\nessential drivers in a big citometry\ndata set and this tutorial is heavily\ninspired by statquest and several others\nso please like And subscribe to\nstatquest channel they do amazing\nwork in short what it means is if you\nhave a big Matrix that is say 33\nDimensions 33 cell populations time 24\nsubjects you can can use magic like\nprincipal components to reduce this 33\ndimensional data set to two dimensions\nand capture a lot of the variantes this\nis a preview of what we're going to walk\nthrough but this is an example study\ncomparing young middle-age and\ncentenarians and seeing the different\nimmune profiles for these different\npatients so how do how do we get here\nand what is that all mean um what we're\ngoing to do is Step through a synthetic\ndata set inspired by real life Lugi at\nAl in\n2007 so this was a experiment designed\nfor this particular uh poster excuse me\nfor this particular paper they had 24\nsubjects nine young people eight\nmiddle-aged seven centenarians and they\ncaptured 33 T Cell subsets from an eight\ncolor flow panel but you can imagine\ncapturing hundreds thousands or millions\nor potentially billions with\nunsupervised\nclustering so we're going to show the\nsynthetic data set and which is inspired\nabout this but then we'll also show the\nreal life findings to to compare\nthose so for example for each patient\nthey had a blood specimen they ran\nthrough a cytometer and then they\ncaptured 33 populations which are the\nrows over here and then the columns are\nthe individual subjects so for example\nthe individual young people over here\nand centenarians on the right and you\ncan see here the percentages which are\nthe percentage of the immune State\ncaptured by\num or of this particular cell type that\nthis person had like 2% 3% Etc so these\nrows and columns are what we're going to\ndo principal component analysis\non so let's let's uh step back a second\nhere so we said 33 populations by 24\nsubjects if we just do two Dimensions so\nwe take a blood specimen put it in a\ncytometer and just capture two\npopulations and we have a lot of\ndata it's easy to plot two dimensions on\nan XY plane so let's take let's go back\nover here so let's take this young one\n75% and\n2% we can plot somebody like this on an\nXY plane because we're only capturing\ntwo Dimensions so young one over here\nyoung two over here centenarians over\nhere\nEtc and let's uh also you know reiterate\nthat this tutorial is only useful if you\nare interested in caring about the\ndifferences between different\npopulations if you don't care about the\ndifferences between uh you know say dose\ngroups response groups then this\nprobably isn't uh a useful tool right\nnow but if you do care about the\ndifferences then principal component\nanalysis is\nawesome so let's bump it up to one more\nDimension so you go when from two\nDimensions to three dimensions so now we\nH have individual cell populations over\nhere um cell population one two three\nand the individual young people and then\ncentenarians on this side\nat three dimensions this is also not so\nbad you can see the XY and Z plane over\nhere and you can see the separation\nbetween centenarians and young people so\nremember in the XYZ plane we can plot\nall of these dimensions and we can see\nthis kind of cluster and or clustering\nand we can see this kind of\nSeparation but what happens when we go\nto four dimensions or 30 Dimensions or\n298 dimensions and this is where Minds\nget blown so the human brain can only\nvisualize in three dimensions and so\nthis is where PCA also known as\nprincipal component analysis comes in\nand there's going to be some fancy\nmathematical jargon but we'll hopefully\nbreak it\ndown a reminder PCA is a way to see the\nessential drivers in a big cytometry\ndata set in two Dimensions or three\ndimensions so if you've got 40\nDimensions or 100 Dimensions or whatever\nyou want to reduce it down to two or\nthree dimensions but not lose a lot of\nthe variation in the underlying data\nset so this is would be the end product\nif you have a 33 dimensional data set\nYou' ultimately be able to reduce it\ndown to a two-dimensional data set as we\nshowed in the beginning with cenarius\nmiddle-aged people young people over\nhere you can see pc1 and PC2 are little\nvariables here that we going to show in\nmore detail and these have numbers here\nof the amount of variance the data set\nthey capture so 24 4.8 over here and\n12.23% variance you sum these up these\nwill the Casual reader will note this\nthese constitute 36% of the variance so\nwe're going to walk through exactly how\nthese are computed and what they mean\nfor your uh data set\nanalysis so how do we get to this this\nparticular two-dimensional plot we\nstarted with this 33 dimensional plot\nwith 33 populations in 24\nsubjects and then we computed What's\ncalled the co-variance between between\nvariables so uh over here this is an\nexcerpt of the of a matrix where we have\nfive individual cells and for each\nindividual cell we compute how much it\nco-varies with itself and how much it uh\ncovaries with other different uh cells\nas well so for example CD4 TN cd127 cd95\nminus cd38 dim with itself and then with\nanother uh variable with another immune\ncell it's etc\netc and the diagonal will show either\nsignal or noise so high uh value over\nhere is probably interesting a small\nvalue is probably noise off diagonal is\nredundancy so large values are redundant\nand small values are going to be noise\nand so we're going to walk through to\nbuild your intuition for\nthat so\nlet's uh go down to a a a smaller\nversion of this data set or excuse me a\ndummy version of this data set and uh to\nexplain that more detail so remember on\nthe diagonal of that covariance M Matrix\nlarge values are interesting and off\ndiagonal uh these are you know the off\ndiagonal shows redundancy so large\nvalues are redundant and small values\nare\nnoise so these are the raw population\npercentages of t- cell subjects across\nsubjects uh t- cell subsets across\nsubjects so if you take a sample over\nhere like high variance T subset one\nthis varies a lot as you look from left\nto right you go from subject one to\nsubject 10 this is going up and down\nquite a bit same with this subject as\nwell this noise subset that we've\nlabeled isn't changing that much so as\nyou go from left to right it varies very\nlittle um off diagonal these look quite\nsimilar to one another so if you look 19\n11 10 Etc so T Cell subset 4 and T Cell\nsubset 5 look very similar to one\nanother so they're likely going to be\nnoise and then off diagonal these vary a\nlot from each other so these are likely\nto what these are likely to be useful so\nif you think about this this High\nvariance population is likely to have a\nhigh covariance with\nitself this noise population is going to\nhave a very low covariance with itself\nit doesn't uh it's not going to change\nthat much these redundant populations U\nwill have a low covariance with one\nanother\nand these uh uh useful populations are\nvery likely to have a high covariance\nwith one another so uh this is very you\nknow uh going to be going to come in\nhandy in our covariance uh diagram\nlater so what principal components goal\nis is to drop noisy populations and\nfocus really on the signal populations\nand potentially eliminate redundant\npopulations as\nwell so let's go down to more more\ndetails so zooming out to all 33\npopulations so here you have the\ncovariance Matrix and high values on the\ndiagonal are signal and uh you can see\nbasically High values on the the off\ndiagonal um are going to be\ncharacterized by co-variance between\nthose two particular populations oops so\nnow let's zoom out to all 33 populations\nso you can see over here the diagonal\nyou'll see a lot of signal on these\nparticular uh values and the off\ndiagonal you're going to see potential\nmarkers of\nredundancy so if two variables vary\ntogether then they have a low covariance\num and if two variables uh are you know\nbasically uh if two variables vary\ntogether they're have a low low Co\nvariance so this this could be\npotentially um interesting for\nus um so now we can to compute the igen\nvalues of this Matrix so we I Val is a\nvery complex term and we're not going to\ngo into the entire derivation here but\nfrom this big Matrix you get all the\nindividual principal components here and\nthen individual igen values so igen\nvalue one is\n3,248 that's 24% of the total variation\nso this is computed by taking 324 and\nsumming this entire column together and\ngetting to 24% so this captures a lot of\nvariation in the population\nprincipal component four\n5737 this is\n8.17% so 573 divided by the entirety of\nthis column gets you to\n8.17% so here's a definition here the\npc1 axis is the first principal\nDirection along which the samples show\nthe largest\nvariation let me pause again here this\nis beyond the scope of this tutorial to\nexplain igen values and igen vectors\nthere's a great tutorial linked here\nthat you'll be able to see\nuh in the YouTube and that's from three\nblue one brown so if you're interested\nin that uh feel free to check that\nout let's assume you have these\nprincipal components derived for your\ncytometry data set so you've got pc1\nthrough pc7 you've got all these\nindividual igen\nvalues each principal component is going\nto correspond to a set of loadings so\nlet's take pc1 and this particular I\nvalue and you're going to go down over\nhere and you can see these coefficients\nare going to tell you which subsets\nmatter the most so for each cellular\npopulation you're going to see pc1\nloadings\n0.237 uh\n0.195 0.183\n0.307 um and we're going to be able to\nplot XY from these pc1 and PC2 loadings\nso we start here with this raw\npercentage\n75.4% and these coefficients will tell\nyou which subsets matter the most so pc1\nloadings PC2 loadings and we multiply\nthrough so 75.4 *\n0.237 gets you to\n17870 75.4 time\n0.156 gets you to\n11725 so this is what we're going to\nplot on the XY\nplane so this is the pc1 and PC2 axes\nand um you can see the centenarians the\nmiddleaged and young people all plotted\nso we reduced 33 Dimensions down to two\nDimensions by taking pc1 and\nPC2 so what is the value of this entire\nexercise we've captured a 33 dimensional\ndata set in two Dimensions so you've got\na big cytometry data sets with dozens\nhundreds or thousands of cells measured\nby specimens and you want to see what\ndrives the difference between an\nendpoint like respons or\ndose now bonus is to explain correlation\nCircle plots this is a way to\ngraphically represent the relationship\nbetween the original variables and the\nprincipal\ncomponents so for these individual t-\ncell populations you're going to have\nthe position of the variable on the plot\nand the igen values which are going to\ndescribe the magnitude of variable\ncontribution so for example pc1 loading\nof 0.29 is high and then you've got 0.13\nand 0.12 these contributions are quite\nlow so let's see how to read a\ncorrelation Circle plot so over here\nyou'll see Sim ly the pc1 and PC2 plots\nand you'll see different cell\npopulations let's take this one CD4\npositive TN cd127 positive cd95 positive\nCD3 dim the magnitude long arrows\ncontribute more to the variation and\nshort arrows don't contribute that much\nand if it's more horizontal then it\ncontributes more to pc1 and more\nvertical it contributes more to\nPC2 so this is showing a correlation\nCircle plot for the top five t- cell pip\nso let's go to some real findings from\nlugli at Al and this is actually came\nfrom the real life data set so you have\nyoung patients over here middle-age\npatients over here centenarians and\ntheir pc1s and PC tws and PC3 is were\nmuch better than the r synthetic they\nhad 60% variation in the first principal\ncomponent 28% over here 4. 77% here so\nthey captured a lot of the variants like\n87 plus almost like 9\n92% from all three components so they\nwere capturing a lot of the the data set\nvariation in their real life data set\nand they s found that young donors in\nadvanced age were different based on\nmemory t- cells and specifically these\ndifferentiation markers were up in young\ndonors and these uh differentiation\nmarkers were up in advanced\nage so now let's turn to a Takeo data\nset so we're we offer CCA on app. take.\nbio and this came from University of\nMinnesota in 2022 this is a phase 2\nclinical trial with 40 subjects 20\nspecimens 20 responders and 20\nnon-responders so let's click on over to\nsee this data set which you can also\nplay around with all the credentials are\nover here so you can log in whenever you\nlike we're going to go to the umn data\nset here and and we're just going to\nquickly reorient ourselves remember\nthere's 40 samples 20 subjects over here\nand let's go to group similarity and\nhere you can see the principal component\nanalysis and the explained variance pc1\n55% PC2\n19.6 so these do a good job of capturing\nthe variant so let's color by response\nso we can see a little bit of separation\nbetween responders and\nnon-responders and then further down\ndown we're going to Let's sh this down\nto seven contributors so we can see\ndifferent contributors what is driving\nthe difference so for example classical\nmonocytes are driving a big difference\nC4 positive T Central memory are driving\nthe second second most and cytolytic NK\ncells which one wouldn't necessarily\nexpect on a classical flow panel are the\nthird\nhere so yeah you can see that in a\nlittle bit more detail over here so\nclassical mon sites all the way down to\ncyto kind producing and K\ncells so this could tell you what drives\nthe difference in treatment response as\nwell so wrapping up PCA is particularly\nuseful when the the um data set is\nhighly correlated so you can assume that\nthere may be redundancy in the data or\nthat you can potentially drop variables\nwithout losing uh an explanatory power\nso this is a great quote which is PC can\nbe used to reduce original variables\ninto a smaller number of new variables\nbut still explain a lot of the variance\nof original variables in fact you can\neven quantify how much is retained\nafterwards so with that we'll wrap up\nand if you're interested in more you can\ncheck out app. too. bio we have tons of\ndata sets there that you can play with\nand uh if you've got any further\nquestions feel free to email us or\ncontact us at take. bio so thanks
