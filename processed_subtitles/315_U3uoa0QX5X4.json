  "text": "well that's pretty cool\nlet's build one\nhi welcome back to omg the cloud\ntoday we are going to go ahead and\nassemble that neat little temperature\nsensor i just showed you so the first\nthing we should do is to step through\nthe components that are involved in here\nfirst we have our solar panel this\nprovides just enough charge\nto keep the battery topped off and power\nthe circuit\nand with this it can essentially run\nindefinitely next up we have our charge\ncontroller our tp4056\nthis takes care of our input from the\nsolar panel and output to the\nmicrocontroller and charging the battery\nand then this is our nice\nlittle environmental sensor so this uh\nhandles temperature humidity and\nbarometric pressure runs on an spi bus\nso this is something that is very\nfamiliar to microcontroller platforms\nand it's addressable so you can put\nother things on that same bus\nand just overall a great choice small\npackage\naccurate and pretty reliable we're also\ngoing to use a 220k\nohm resistor this is going to go between\nan analog pin\nand the battery voltage input so that we\ncan\ndetect the voltage of our battery that's\nan important thing to know when we're\nrunning a battery-powered circuit that\nis being charged\nwe want to know that we are maintaining\na good voltage on that battery\nand i went ahead and pre-cut some of\nthese wires just to make\nthings go a little bit quicker\nadditionally for this project you're\ngoing to need a good soldering iron\nand you want to have one of these\ncleaning ball things here some good\nfine electronics soldering wire i have\nlinks to all of these down in the\ndescription\nso if you're not real familiar with\nsoldering projects this is a good time\nto go ahead and get yourself started out\nwith the proper set of tools\nso let's get started um i want to go\nahead and just pre-tin\nthese solder pads here so go ahead and\nflow out a good little solder pad here\non each\nof the positive and negative outputs on\nthat solar panel another thing to be\nhelpful is one of these little alligator\nclip\nextra pair of hands these can be really\nhelpful just for holding parts while\nyou're soldering so once you have the\ncharge controller soldered up let's go\nahead and get the\nspi bus leads attached onto the micro\ncontroller i'm going to throw a graphic\nup here just to show exactly where we\nare attaching because i know it's super\nhard to see these so yeah take a look at\nthat there we want the\nclock pin and then the data pin soldered\nup and then we're gonna go ahead and\nattach\nground and voltage in and let's turn our\nattention back to our charge controller\nlet's go ahead and get the rest of those\nleads soldered up we got our battery\nholder in place\nand then we need the output leads that\nare going to go to the microcontroller\ni'm going to go ahead and get those guys\nsoldered up real quick too get that\npositive lead soldered in place\ntint up the other end a little bit\nnegative side as well\nand we're going to go ahead and solder\nthe positive side into the vcc\nin on our microcontroller and let's get\nthe negative side over onto a ground pin\non the microcontroller okay i think\nthat's going to do it so we've got our\ncomponents all soldered up\nand our temperature sensor in place and\nsolar panel and battery holder and we're\nready to go\nand if just to test it if i go ahead and\nplug in the battery here\nwe'll see that the microcontroller light\ncomes on\ngood we're in good shape so that's going\nto do it for today\nwe've got our build complete and our\nnext\nepisode we're going to go ahead and\nflash a firmware on here now in order to\nflash a firmware though we need\nsomething to flash with so we're going\nto be\nusing a software package called esp home\nwhich plugs in nicely to home assistant\nand we're going to be using a command\nline tool called esp\ntool to flash our\nfirmware packages on there so we're\ngoing to cover all that in next week's\nepisode\nthank you so much for joining me today\nthis has been a lot of fun i hope you\nlearned something today\nplease subscribe give me a thumbs up and\ndon't forget to hit the notification\nbell so you see when the next episode\ncomes in\nhave a great weekend and i'll see you\nnext time\n[Music]\n",
