  "text": "hey there everyone welcome to\ntechnoholic today we are diving into one\nof the most underused but powerful\nfeature in Windows 11 today in this\nvideo we will talk about wise typing and\nif you are tired of typing long email or\ndocument this video will explain you how\nto dictate text efficiently and unlock\nthe potential of yse typing in Windows\n11 so stick around for accable tips\nhidden features and essential command\nthat will transform how you type so\nwithout further Ado let's dive in and\nthere we go now we are in our computer\nscreen first thing first let's\nunderstand how we can activate Vice\ntyping I would say it is super simple\nall you need to do is you need to press\nWindows key and H button Al together and\nthis will instantly bring up a wise\ntyping toolbar as you can see here and\nthis toolbar will work across all the\napps whether you are in word or a\nbrowser or even in messenging app let me\nquickly show you one such demo for\nexample if we talk about notepad notepad\nis one of the most lean or minimalistic\napplication available in Windows and\nhere you will not see or find any fancy\nfeature so in such situation also you\ncan utilize a Windows wise typing all we\nneed to do here is is we need to just\nsimply click inside Microsoft Notepad\nand now I'm going to hit windows in Ed\nand now I can start dictating and then\nit will able to recognize what I am\nsaying and there we go guys here you can\nsee as I am speaking the notepad is\nwriting and it really doesn't matter\nwhich app we are using now in order to\nstop dictation all we need to do is we\nsimply need to click on our screen like\nthis and then um you will see the typing\nfunction stopped and if you again want\nto continue writing let's repeat the\nsame step I'm going to click on this\nbutton and this will again start\nlistening to what I am\nsaying now we can also click on here to\nstop it and one more important thing\nthat I would like to tell you you will\nrequire an act active internet\nconnection as Windows use cloud-based\nspeech\nrecognition and as I mentioned before\nyou can utilize this voice typing\nfunction not only in notepad but also in\nMicrosoft Word and anywhere else the\nonly thing required is a text field or a\ndata\nfield now we just saw how we can type\nusing wise typing now let's make sure\nyour your wice typing is fully optimized\nfor workflow for that first of all what\nwe will do here is we will enable auto\npunctuation this saves you the hazle of\nmanually saying period or every few\nsecond so now let's see how we can\nenable auto punctuation for that let's\nagain press windows and H and now here\nwe need to click on this setting gear\nicon and then here you can see I\nactually have turned it on from this\nsetting you can turn it off and on okay\nnow let me write here\nsomething to turn this on just click on\nsetting gear on the toolbar and toggle\nthe auto punctuation\nswitch and there we go here we can see\num Auto punctuation tried to add the\nfull stop as well as question mark here\nokay so it may happen in certain\nscenario it may not work that perfectly\nso I would say it totally depend on you\nif you would like to utilize Auto\npunctuation or not you can always toggle\nit on and off if you toggle it off then\nwhat we can do here is we can also say\ncertain command manually for example to\nturn this on Comma just click on the\nsetting gear on the toolbar full stop\nnext line toggling the auto punctuation\nswitch full stop so in this way guys\nalso we can manually ask to add\npunctuation now let's talk about how we\ncan improve accuracy of voice typing\nfirst of all make sure that you are\nusing a good quality mic Windows 11 does\nexcellent job with its speech\nrecognization but the quality of your\nmic can make a huge difference next here\nyou need to make sure that your correct\nmic is selected for that let's again\njump into our computer screen and now\nhere I'm going to click on Windows and\nthen um let's click here on settings and\nin settings uh what I'm going to do here\nis I'm going to go to system and in\nsystem let's search for sound so here we\ncan see the sound is there and from here\nyou need to select the correct mic so in\nmy case I think I already have selected\ncorrect mic which is sh mb7 another\nthing what we can do is avoid accessive\nbackground noise for best result also\nkeep your speech language settings\naligned to your accent for that we need\nto look for time and language which is\nhere and then here we need to click on\nspeech now from here you need to choose\nappropriate language so here seems like\nI already have installed only one VI\npackage let's say I am more comfortable\nwith English India so I can basically\nadd English India here\nokay and then you can select that\nparticular language here okay but the\ngood thing here with Windows 11 is now\nyou're going to get this option which\nsays that recognize non-native accent\nfor this language so if you enable it\nyou will see that even non-native accent\nwill be recognized by this language\nwhich will further improve in\nidentifying what we are saying now let's\ntake our voice typing experience a notch\nwith some wise command this is where the\nwise typing became even more powerful\nfor example um let me actually open\nMicrosoft Word and then um here what I\ncan do is let me again start writing\nhere the quick brown fox jump over the\nlazy dog select that delete that so you\nsee these keywords can help you to\nselect your word word delete it as well\nnow let's talk about wise typing in\nMicrosoft Word if you are using the 365\nversion then you can also utilize the\ninbuilt typing function available in\nMicrosoft Word Excel and PowerPoint just\nyou need to Simply go to your home Tab\nand on the rightmost side you will see\nthis dictate function just you need to\nclick on dictate and then you can start\nspeaking this works similarly to to the\nbuiltin wise typing tool in Windows 11\nand yes Auto Punctuation is also\navailable here too that one can enable\nAgain by going to settings and then here\nyou need to click on enable auto\npunctuation after enabling Auto\npunctuation now you will see that the\nnecessary comma full stop are being\nadded\nautomatically next line don't forget you\ncan also customize your dictation\nfurther by adjusting the spoken language\nand enabling the profant filter if you\nare working on professional or school\nprojects sometime you may also run into\nissues then in that case you do not need\nto worry about it is usually an easy fix\nif your voice typing is not working make\nsure that you are selecting correct\nmicrophone again you can check that by\ngoing to settings in settings we have\ngot this privacy and security and then\nyou need to look for speech so make sure\nthat this option is turned off and now\nyou are ready to take full advantage of\nwise typing in Windows 11 and that's all\nguys from my side in this video I hope\nthat you find this video helpful and\ninformational if so then please don't\nforget to subscribe to technoholic to\nsee for more productivity hacks and if\nyou have got any kind of questions or\ndoubt drop the comment with your\nfavorite VI typing tip thanks for\nwatching and I will see you soon with\nthe next one till then you take care and\nbye-bye\n",
