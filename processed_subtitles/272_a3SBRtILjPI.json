  "text": "roboflow is a set of tools for building\nproduction ready computer vision\nworkflows fast better data sets seamless\nmodel training easier deployment let's\nsay you're a cashier and people often\npay in your store in individual coins\nwe want to build a model that's able to\nidentify each of those individual coins\nsum them up and tell us how much someone\nhas paid now while in this problem we're\ncounting coins we could be counting a\nvariety of things cars in our parking\nlot taking inventory in our back rooms\nmaybe we're even a manufacturer and\nwe're looking for defects on the coins\nthat we're producing at any rate\neverything gets started with a workspace\nand a project let's dive in I've already\ncreated a workspace here called coin\ncounting Inc I also collected some\nimages earlier where I stabbed some\nphotos of these coins on my counter I'll\nbe creating an object detection problem\nbecause I only need to know the\nindividual coins and what they are to\nsum up their value roboflow supports\nclassification and segmentation as well\nI'll be detecting coins and then\nbuilding a counter\nhere is where I can upload my images\nnote that Rebel flow supports videos and\nimages alike so if I drop in a video it\nbreaks it in individual frames for me\nI'll also drop in all of these images\nthat I already have prepared\nnotably these images aren't annotated\nbut I did annotate a couple of them in a\ndifferent tool earlier roboflow supports\nover 34 annotation import formats so if\nyou already have annotated images from\nelsewhere you should add the annotations\nand robofo will automatically match them\nup I'll save and continue and create a\ntraining test split for later when we're\nprepping our model now I uploaded my\nimages using the web interface but I\ncould have uploaded them using an API I\ncould also use open images or open\nsource data sets to add here\nnow I'm ready to annotate I'm only going\nto annotate alone so I'll assign all the\nimages to myself\nfor annotation I jump in to this\nindividual image and I just start\ndrawing boxes because I'm doing an\nobject detection problem\nI'll create here a class 4 quarter\nhere I see a nickel\nsee another nickel over here so I'll add\nanother box there this is a dime so I'll\nuse the dime class here there's another\ndime\na dime here\nand a dirty Penny but nonetheless a\npenny and over here a quarter I only\nhave a small number of images here but\nit's good enough to get started I'll use\na little uh movie Magic to fast forward\nlet's pretend I was labeling for instant\nsegmentations that have object detection\nso I needed to create polygons I could\nuse the smart polygon tool to draw a box\nand then have that box snap to the shape\nI can click the areas that I don't want\nthe polygon to include so it gets a\nlittle bit more fine-tuned\nand voila I have a much nicer polygon\nlabel since I'm only doing object\ndetection I'll continue with bounding\nboxes\nbecause I've already labeled a lot of\nthese images and trained a model I can\nuse model assisted labeling to label\nthings for me so to turn that on I'll\nturn on label assist all labeled with my\nmoney counter model that I already have\nit asks which classes I want to use and\nthen it makes guesses based on the prior\nmodel that it might have already trained\nand it looks like here it nailed it\nNickel Nickel Dime Diamond dime so I'll\njump to the next image\nand there it's doing a really good job\nof filling these in here it looks like\nthis was actually a quarter and this is\nhow I'm going to finish labeling the\nrest of the images\nokay great I've annotated all of my\nimages I'll go ahead and add all these\nto my data set when I generate a data\nset version I can do things like ad\npre-processing and augmentation steps\nI'll add a few steps that I think will\nincrease the variety of images that I\nthink the model might encounter in the\nreal world like flipped coins maybe the\ncoins are sometimes closer further away\nmaybe the Hue may vary sometimes the\nexposure could even be brighter or\ndarker that looks pretty good now I can\ngenerate a data set version for a quick\nfirst check I'll just kick off a\ntraining job I'll kick off from the\nMicrosoft Coco checkpoint so the\ntraining is faster and easier if I\nwanted to train my own architecture I\ncould get the data in the format that I\nneed for example maybe YOLO V5 and here\nrobothole will automatically create the\ndownload code that I need I could then\ngo to use Rebel flow's model Library\nwhile the model is training I get a\ntraining graph to see roughly if the\nmodel is learning the task let me show\nyou another model that's out of the oven\nand already done baking it did a pretty\ngood job it got 77.6 map which is a good\nstarting point when a model finishes\ntraining in roboflow we can easily try\nout that model by clicking the deploy\ntab we have examples available to us\nthat our model has never seen before in\nfact I have an example image that the\nmodel has never seen before here on my\nlocal computer and I can drop this in\nand see if the model finds those claims\nand indeed it does with the deploy tab I\ncan also get ready to use my model in a\nwide array I could use on a webcam I\ncould use it in real time I could use it\nvia API I could deploy it to a Jetson I\ncould use it on an iOS I could use it in\nmy own Docker container and deploy that\ninside my own environment offline for\nthis example I'll use the hosted API so\nI can make an API call with an example\nimage and get back the responses with\nthose responses Alden see which coins\nare present and do summing let's get\nstarted with our script so I'll go ahead\nand copy this python of course you want\nto keep your API key secret and I'll\ninvalidate mine I'll drop this in I'll\nshow you that I can load in my example\nimage name here\nand it'll print out the predictions\nand you'll see below I get all the\nresponses in this nice Json so for pred\nin response inside the predictions\ndictionary\nI will print the pred class\nthis will print out all the example\nclasses that the model sees in this\nimage\nat 40 confidence it does see each of\nthose classes I like to bump this up to\n70 just to be a little bit more certain\nthough it depends on the problem that\nyou're solving for each of those preds\nwe actually want to do logic if it's a\nquarter at 25 cents if it's a dime at 10\ncents I've already written that logic so\nI'm going to just copy paste that\ndirectly into my script\nsum them up and print out the results\nand sure enough the sum is 68 now what's\nalso exciting is I can use this model\nimmediately on my webcam I'll take my\nphone here and I'll open up the webcam\nformat and let me show you this work in\nreal time\nover top of my coins\nso there you have it good luck building\n",
