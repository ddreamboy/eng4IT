  "text": "I'm Joel Young and I'm the CTO here at\ndigi international at digi security is\nat the forefront of everything we do yet\nwe see that in planning an IOT strategy\nit oftentimes isn't as well thought\nthrough as it should be I often hear\nquestions like I want to know if the\ncloud is secure or how can i deploy\napplications in our data center but\nrarely does someone ask me to prove that\na specific device is secure and it's a\nquestion that should be asked more often\nHP security research did an evaluation\nand found that 70% of what we call IOT\ndevices are vulnerable to an attack\ntoday I want to cover five steps to help\nensure a more secure Internet of Things\napproach through stronger device\nsecurity the first one will call secure\nboot that means that only authorized\nfirmware can be put on your machine so\nin essence you no matter who's updating\nyour firmware no one can add a few lines\nof code here and there or install some\nmalware because if it isn't authorized\nit's not making it onto that machine now\nlet's take a look at authentication how\nmany devices do you think are shipped\nwith default password authentication or\nno authentication at all passwords are\npasse especially for machines strong\ncertificate based authentication is the\nbest way to secure access to a device\nyou only have to look to the recent\nmirai ddos attack which took out\ncompanies like amazon spotify and\ntwitter all because there is no\nauthentication on home routers and\nset-top boxes often overlooked are\nprotected ports this is physical\nsecurity sometimes they're called JTAG\nports essentially there are other ways\nof actually going in and physically\ndebugging the system and since you have\nto physically have access to the device\nmost people don't worry about it what do\nwe know about the world of Internet\nwell what we know is that machines are\nplaced in places where people often art\nor people that care aren't right if I\nshowed up in a maintenance suit and told\nyou I was just doing some repairs you\nmight not think anything of it but\nunless those debugging ports are\nprotected you've just opened yourself up\nto being hat now let's talk storage many\nof us know that if we're storing data on\na large enterprise system the data is\nsecure but what about the flash storage\non your embedded device it turns out\nembedded systems typically have\nsomething called flash storage and they\nmight hold some information from time to\ntime that's not immediately secured or\nencrypted and that can open you up to a\nsecurity breach leaving all that\ninformation at risk last but not least\nthere's secure connections secure\nconnections have two components one of\nthose components is actually encrypting\nthe over-the-air data and the other is\nappropriate key exchange appropriate key\nexchange must include authentication and\nauthorization upfront to set up that\nencrypted connection why are they both\nimportant because if you don't do the\nfirst part right then the keys are open\nand anybody can unencrypted and if\nyou're not encrypting then someone could\neasily take a peek at your data but not\nall data is created equal right does\nanyone really care about your\ntemperature sensor data well it turns\nout that things like IP addresses and\nport identification may also get sent\nand if you're not securing that whole\ncommunication pipe it leaves it open for\nan attack\nso what's included with digi trust fence\nsecure booth that's the secure firmware\nauthentication covers proper\nidentification no default passwords\nprotected ports those debug ports\nrequire authentication so that they're\nnot open secure storage\nin other words encrypted storage even in\nan embedded device secure connections\nmake sure that you have secured\nconnections encrypted authorized and\nauthenticated so when you think in terms\nof IOT security remember those five key\nareas and then look to digi trust vents\nto give you the security tools you need\nso that you don't have to worry and you\ncan sleep well at night\n",
