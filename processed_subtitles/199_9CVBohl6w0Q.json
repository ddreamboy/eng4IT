  "text": "hello guys welcome back my name is Adam\nand is the fifth episode in our\nfundamentals course the topic for today\nis cloud service models what are their\ndifferences and what are their key\ncharacteristics stay tuned as always at\nthe beginning of the episode let me\nstart with the session objectives so\nwhat is being tested during the exam in\nthis section you need to understand what\nexactly is infrastructure platform and\nsoftware as a service but also\nunderstand them well enough to be able\nto compare and contrast them between\neach other and to better understand that\nwe need to first understand what exactly\nis considered infrastructure platform\nand software and for that reason I\nprepared you a very small exercise an\nexample so let's imagine we are a\nstartup company and we want to host our\nown application and build entire\ninfrastructure for that reason of course\nthe first thing we will need to do that\nis to purchase some servers so all the\nhardware that will actually run the\napplications themselves obviously our\nservers needs to be able to connect to\nthe Internet\ntherefore we will need to provide all\nthe networking infrastructure as well\nincluding the Internet connectivity\nitself because every server needs a\nstorage you will need to additionally\nprovide a storage infrastructure another\ndoors our hard drives or solid stair\ndrives some raid our eyes and things\nlike that we need to provide that\nadditionally once this is in place you\nhave all the hardware needed in order to\nrun the server now in order to ensure\nthe best utilization of the hardware\nthat you have you will want to run some\nvirtualization software so that you can\nrun multiple virtual machine on a single\nHardware piece so that you can host\nmultiple applications but still maintain\nthe total separation of the environments\nand virtualization software will allow\nyou to do that at that point you will\nstart creating multiple virtual machines\nin order to host your applications all\nthose virtual machines will need an\noperating systems\nwhenever does Windows or Linux or any\nother operating system on the market as\nthe operating system is in place you\nadditionally want to install a\nmiddleware which typically means all the\nsoftware additions that you need in\norder to run the system and the\napplication itself and a typical\napplication will additionally need a\nruntime so another layer of the software\nwhich will host your application if this\nis a web application this could be IES\nweb container if it's a container\napplication and maybe a docker but\nruntime is additional layer that you\nwill need to maintain yourself once all\nof those layers are in place we are now\nfinally ready host our application and\napplication data on that system well\nthere are quite a few layers on the\nscreen a few clear distinctions can be\nmade here first four layers from the\nbottom are so-called infrastructure so\nall the layers that directly are related\nto the hardware and the virtualization\nnext layers can be grouped our platform\nlayers so operating system middleware\nand runtime to all the software's all\nthe system and configuration that is\nrequired for you to run the application\nbut not the application itself and the\nlast part the application and the data\nitself is so-called software layer and\nthe asset service part of our episode\nmeans who will manage what if you manage\nall of those layers that means we're\ntalking about the on premises so the\nclear ownership is on you you manage all\nthe infrastructure platform and the\nsoftware and cloud providers not even\ninvolved but if you decide to outsource\nthe infrastructure purchase the\ninfrastructure from the cloud provider\nto let Microsoft manage the\ninfrastructure while you manage the\nplatform and software this is so-called\ninfrastructure as a service so the\nownership of that part goes to a cloud\nprovider in this case Microsoft will\nmanage all the networking hardware and\nthe virtualization itself while you will\nmanage the platform and the software\npart typical use cases here are\nmigration of the world from the\non-premises testing and development but\nalso extending your on-premise\nenvironment of the capacity of the cloud\nso that you can create storage backup\nand disaster recovery scenarios\nthe list of services used in order to\nimplement infrastructure-as-a-service\nsolutions is quite long but typically\nyou will see things like virtual machine\nvirtual networks managed disks or one of\nmany services that you can use for this\npurpose but in general the rule of thumb\nis if someone says that they have\ninfrastructure as a service solution\nthat means they have a lot of virtual\nmachines and probably this is the skills\nthey're looking for if you're designing\nfor the cloud you most likely will go\none level up so you will allow Microsoft\nto manage the platform and the\ninfrastructure part while you just build\nyour own applications in that case we\nare talking about platform as a service\nin this model cloud provider will manage\nthe infrastructure and the platform so\nbesides the hardware Microsoft will need\nto manage operating system all the\nsecurity patches all the middleware and\nthe runtime to host your application and\nyou will only need to build and manage\nyour own applications typically this\nmodel is used whenever you're developing\ncloud applications this could be a\nstate-of-the-art web applications AI\nmachine learning business analytic\nsolutions well pretty much anything if\nyou're building applications you're most\nlikely using platform as a service\nsolutions in this case we can talk about\nSQL for relational databases app service\nfor web hosting logic apps for\nenterprise integrations function apps\nfor several Azure one of the dozens or\neven hundreds of other services allowing\nyou to take advantage of cloud in a\nplatform as a service model and if you\ndecide to outsource everything to\nMicrosoft that means you are using\nsoftware as a service model in that case\nthe ownership of the cloud provider is\neverything and there's nothing on you\nyou could think what would be the case\nof software as a service usually this\nmeans buying of the Shelf applications\napplications like Outlook Skype onedrive\nand all the other business applications\nthat you're probably using every day\nthis is software as a service from\nMicrosoft managers every\nand you just use the applications I will\nnow summarize the differences between\nthose service models but from a little\nbit different angle if you let cloud\nprovider manage the physical data center\nbuildings\nnetworking security servers and storage\nwe are talking about infrastructure as a\nservice if that cloud provider\nadditionally manages the operating\nsystem and the development tools we are\ntalking about the platform as a service\nbut if that cloud provider additionally\nmanages the applications in the data we\nare talking about the software as a\nservice maybe this view will let you\nbetter understand the scope of\nresponsibilities for each of those\nservice models and that's pretty much it\nif you want to summarize what you\nlearned go to my website - episode\nnumber 5 check out the study guides with\nofficial links to Microsoft documents on\nthose free service types\ncheck out the cheat sheet and check your\nown knowledge what you learned here in\nthe practice test and that's it for
