what\nexactly is infrastructure platform and\nsoftware as a service but also\nunderstand them well enough to be able\nto compare and contrast them between\neach other and to better understand that\nwe need to first understand what exactly\nis considered infrastructure platform\nand software and for that reason I\nprepared you a very small exercise an\nexample so let's imagine we are a\nstartup company and we want to host our\nown application and build entire\ninfrastructure for that reason of course\nthe first thing we will need to do that\nis to purchase some servers so all the\nhardware that will actually run the\napplications themselves obviously our\nservers needs to be able to connect to\nthe Internet\ntherefore we will need to provide all\nthe networking infrastructure as well\nincluding the Internet connectivity\nitself because every server needs a\nstorage you will need to additionally\nprovide a storage infrastructure another\ndoors our hard drives or solid stair\ndrives some raid our eyes and things\nlike that we need to provide that\nadditionally once this is in place you\nhave all the hardware needed in order to\nrun the server now in order to ensure\nthe best utilization of the hardware\nthat you have you will want to run some\nvirtualization software so that you can\nrun multiple virtual machine on a single\nHardware piece so that you can host\nmultiple applications but still maintain\nthe total separation of the environments\nand virtualization software will allow\nyou to do that at that point you will\nstart creating multiple virtual machines\nin order to host your applications all\nthose virtual machines will need an\noperating systems\nwhenever does Windows or Linux or any\nother operating system on the market as\nthe operating system is in place you\nadditionally want to install a\nmiddleware which typically means all the\nsoftware additions that you need in\norder to run the system and the\napplication itself and a typical\napplication will additionally need a\nruntime so another layer of the software\nwhich will host your application if this\nis a web application this could be IES\nweb container if it's a container\napplication and maybe a docker but\nruntime is additional layer that you\nwill need to maintain yourself once all\nof those layers are in place we are now\nfinally ready host our application and\napplication data on that system well\nthere are quite a few layers on the\nscreen a few clear distinctions can be\nmade here first four layers from the\nbottom are so-called infrastructure so\nall the layers that directly are related\nto the hardware and the virtualization\nnext layers can be grouped our platform\nlayers so operating system middleware\nand runtime to all the software's all\nthe system and configuration that is\nrequired for you to run the application\nbut not the application itself and the\nlast part the application and the data\nitself is so-called software layer and\nthe asset service part of our episode\nmeans who will manage what if you manage\nall of those layers that means we're\ntalking about the on premises so the\nclear ownership is on you you manage all\nthe infrastructure platform and the\nsoftware and cloud providers not even\ninvolved but if you decide to outsource\nthe infrastructure purchase the\ninfrastructure from the cloud

cloud\nprovider in this case Microsoft will\nmanage all the networking hardware and\nthe virtualization itself while you will\nmanage the platform and the software\npart typical use cases here are\nmigration of the world from the\non-premises testing and development but\nalso extending your on-premise\nenvironment of the capacity of the cloud\nso that you can create storage backup\nand
