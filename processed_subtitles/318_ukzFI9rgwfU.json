  "text": "we know humans learn from their past\nexperiences\nand machines follow instructions given\nby humans\nbut what if humans can train the\nmachines to learn from the past data and\ndo what humans can do and much faster\nwell that's called machine learning but\nit's a lot more than just learning it's\nalso about understanding and reasoning\nso today we will learn about the basics\nof machine learning\nso that's paul he loves listening to new\nsongs\nhe either likes them or dislikes them\npaul decides this on the basis of the\nsong's tempo\ngenre\nintensity and the gender of voice for\nsimplicity let's just use tempo and\nintensity for now so here tempo is on\nthe x axis ranging from relaxed to fast\nwhereas intensity is on the y axis\nranging from light to soaring we see\nthat paul likes the song with fast tempo\nand soaring intensity while he dislikes\nthe song with relaxed tempo and light\nintensity so now we know paul's choices\nlet's say paul listens to a new song\nlet's name it as song a song a has fast\ntempo and a soaring intensity so it lies\nsomewhere here looking at the data can\nyou guess whether paul will like the\nsong or not correct so paul likes this\nsong by looking at paul's past choices\nwe were able to classify the unknown\nsong very easily right let's say now\npaul listens to a new song let's label\nit as song b so song b\nlies somewhere here with medium tempo\nand medium intensity neither relaxed nor\nfast neither light nor soaring now can\nyou guess whether paul likes it or not\nnot able to guess whether paul will like\nit or dislike it are the choices unclear\ncorrect we could easily classify song a\nbut when the choice became complicated\nas in the case of song b yes and that's\nwhere machine learning comes in let's\nsee how in the same example for song b\nif we draw a circle around the song b we\nsee that there are four votes for like\nwhereas one would for dislike if we go\nfor the majority votes we can say that\npaul will definitely like the song\nthat's all this was a basic machine\nlearning algorithm also it's called k\nnearest neighbors so this is just a\nsmall example in one of the many machine\nlearning algorithms quite easy right\nbelieve me it is but what happens when\nthe choices become complicated as in the\ncase of song b that's when machine\nlearning comes in it learns the data\nbuilds the prediction model and when the\nnew data point comes in it can easily\npredict for it more the data better the\nmodel higher will be the accuracy there\nare many ways in which the machine\nlearns it could be either supervised\nlearning unsupervised learning or\nreinforcement learning let's first\nquickly understand supervised learning\nsuppose your friend gives you one\nmillion coins of three different\ncurrencies say one rupee one euro and\none dirham each coin has different\nweights for example a coin of one rupee\nweighs three grams one euro weighs seven\ngrams and one dirham weighs four grams\nyour model will predict the currency of\nthe coin here your weight becomes the\nfeature of coins while currency becomes\nthe label when you feed this data to the\nmachine learning model it learns which\nfeature is associated with which label\nfor example it will learn that if a coin\nis of 3 grams it will be a 1 rupee coin\nlet's give a new coin to the machine on\nthe basis of the weight of the new coin\nyour model will predict the currency\nhence supervised learning uses labeled\ndata to train the model here the machine\nknew the features of the object and also\nthe labels associated with those\nfeatures on this note let's move to\nunsupervised learning and see the\ndifference suppose you have cricket data\nset of various players with their\nrespective scores and wickets taken when\nyou feed this data set to the machine\nthe machine identifies the pattern of\nplayer performance so it plots this data\nwith the respective wickets on the\nx-axis while runs on the y-axis while\nlooking at the data you'll clearly see\nthat there are two clusters the one\ncluster are the players who scored\nhigher runs and took less wickets while\nthe other cluster is of the players who\nscored less runs but took many wickets\nso here we interpret these two clusters\nas batsmen and bowlers the important\npoint to note here is that there were no\nlabels of batsmen and bowlers hence the\nlearning with unlabeled data is\nunsupervised learning so we saw\nsupervised learning where the data was\nlabeled and the unsupervised learning\nwhere the data was unlabeled and then\nthere is reinforcement learning which is\na reward based learning or we can say\nthat it works on the principle of\nfeedback here let's say you provide the\nsystem with an image of a dog and ask it\nto identify it the system identifies it\nas a cat so you give a negative feedback\nto the machine saying that it's a dog's\nimage the machine will learn from the\nfeedback and finally if it comes across\nany other image of a dog it will be able\nto classify it correctly that is\nreinforcement learning to generalize\nmachine learning model let's see a\nflowchart input is given to a machine\nlearning model which then gives the\noutput according to the algorithm\napplied if it's right we take the output\nas a final result else we provide\nfeedback to the training model and ask\nit to predict until it learns i hope\nyou've understood supervised and\nunsupervised learning so let's have a\nquick quiz you have to determine whether\nthe given scenarios uses supervised or\nunsupervised learning simple right\nscenario one facebook recognizes your\nfriend in a picture from an album of\ntagged photographs\nscenario 2 netflix recommends new movies\nbased on someone's past movie choices\nscenario 3 analyzing bank data for\nsuspicious transactions and flagging the\nfraud transactions think wisely and\ncomment below your answers moving on\ndon't you sometimes wonder how is\nmachine learning possible in today's era\nwell that's because today we have\nhumongous data available everybody is\nonline either making a transaction or\njust surfing the internet and that's\ngenerating a huge amount of data every\nminute and that data my friend is the\nkey to analysis also the memory handling\ncapabilities of computers have largely\nincreased which helps them to process\nsuch huge amount of data at hand without\nany delay and yes computers now have\ngreat computational powers so there are\na lot of applications of machine\nlearning out there to name a few machine\nlearning is used in healthcare where\ndiagnostics are predicted for doctor's\nreview the sentiment analysis that the\ntech giants are doing on social media is\nanother interesting application of\nmachine learning fraud detection in the\nfinance sector and also to predict\ncustomer churn in the e-commerce sector\nwhile booking a gap you must have\nencountered surge pricing often where it\nsays the fair of your trip has been\nupdated continue booking yes please i'm\ngetting late for office\nwell that's an interesting machine\nlearning model which is used by global\ntaxi giant uber and others where they\nhave differential pricing in real time\nbased on demand the number of cars\navailable bad weather rush r etc so they\nuse the surge pricing model to ensure\nthat those who need a cab can get one\nalso it uses predictive modeling to\npredict where the demand will be high\nwith the goal that drivers can take care\nof the demand and search pricing can be\nminimized great hey siri can you remind\nme to book a cab at 6 pm today ok i'll\nremind you\nthanks no problem comment below some\ninteresting everyday examples around you\nwhere machines are learning and doing\namazing jobs so that's all for machine\nlearning basics today from my site keep\nwatching this space for more interesting\nvideos until then happy learning\n",
