  "text": "computer vision explained in five\nminutes hi everybody if you're looking\nto start your career as a computer\nvision professional from scratch then\nyou are in the right place computer\nvision or CV is a branch of computer\nscience that empowers machines to see\nrecognize and process images just like\nhumans computer vision is in fact a\nmultidisciplinary field it could be\ncalled a subfield of artificial\nintelligence Ai and machine learning and\nml computer vision makes use of General\nlearning algorithms and may require the\nuse of specialized methods this diagram\nshows the relationship between\nartificial intelligence and computer\nvision being a multi-disciplinary field\nof study can seem messy for a beginner\nthe reason for this is some techniques\nare borrowed and reused from an\nassortment of engineering and computer\nscience Fields understanding the content\nof digital images is the main objective\nof computer vision this might seem easy\nbut it's not so because computers are\nnot the same as humans they don't have\nthe gift of vision and perception while\nseeing and perceiving the world around\nthem comes naturally to humans that's\nnot the case with\n[Music]\ncomputers how do computer vision\nalgorithms work the computer vision\nalgorithms used today are based on\npattern recognition they typically rely\non convolutional neural networks or CNN\ncomputers are first trained on an\nenormous amount of visual data in this\nstep computers process images and label\nthe various objects on them they also\nfind patterns in those objects for\ninstance if we send a million images of\ncats the computer will first analyze all\nthe images it will then identify\npatterns that are similar to all cats\nand at the end of the whole process\ncreate a model cat as a result the\ncomputer can accurately detect whether\nor not a particular image is a cat each\ntime we sended\npictures the unprecedented growth of\ncomputer vision images dominate the\ninternet today they are everywhere\nsocial media e-commerce stores travel\nsites and more but along with an\nenormous amount of visual data over 3\nbillion images are shared every day we\nalso have easy access to the computing\npower needed to analyze this data\ncomputer vision is a booming field due\nto the latest advancements in this field\nit's true that the field of computer\nvision has grown exponentially in the\nlast few years alone new hardware and\nadvanced algorithms have ensured that\nthe accuracy rates for object\nidentification are high in less than a\ndecade the Improvement in the accuracy\npercentage has been phenomenal it's gone\nup from 50% to 99% making today's\nsystems more accurate than humans it's\nan accepted fact that computers react\nmuch more quickly than humans to visual\ninputs the applications of computer\nvision the earliest experiments in\ncomputer vision began in the 19 1950s\ncomputer vision was however first put to\ncommercial use only in the 1970s to\ndifferentiate typed text from\nhandwritten text but today computer\nvision is a reliable and mature\ntechnology that generates huge cost\nsavings and saves time from defect\ndetection to Intruder detection mask\ndetection to tumor detection crop\nmonitoring to plant monitoring vehicle\nclassification to traffic flow analysis\nand from customer tracking to theft\ndetection the applications of computer\nvision are truly varied computer vision\nis used extensively in the following\nFields retail and Manufacturing\nTransportation Insurance media\nagriculture Health Care Sports banking\naugmented reality and mixed reality home\nsecurity and content management and\nAnalysis the most popular computer\nvision applications include object\nclassification recognizing the broad\ncategory of an object in a photograph\nobject\nidentification identifying the type of\nobject in a photograph object detection\ndetecting the location of an object in a\nphotograph object verification verifying\nthe presence of an object in a\nphotograph object Landmark detection\ndetecting the key points for an object\nin a photograph object segmentation\nsegmenting the pixels that belong to an\nobject in an image and object\nrecognition recognizing the objects in a\nphotograph and pinpointing their\nlocation your path to computer vision\nMastery we have an in-depth course on\nthe AI Sciences platform that covers\ncomputer vision we also have a short\ncourse on computer vision for beginners\nname of the course computer vision\nTheory and projects in Python for\nbeginners 18 sections you'll learn the\nCore Concepts of the computer vision\nfield in this course the important\nelements of this course are the two\nHands-On projects in the concluding\nsection change detection in CCTV cameras\nand smart\nDVRs name of the second course mastering\ncomputer vision Theory and projects in\nPython 323 lessons in this in-depth\ncourse you'll learn to master the basic\nconcepts of computer vision first next\nyou'll move onward to advanced concepts\nif you're interested in learning more\nabout becoming a computer vision\nprofessional then be sure to check out\nour courses at the first link in the\ndescription subscribe and turn on\nnotifications so you don't miss more\nvideos helping you to start your data\nscience and AI career and more check out\nthis playlist of our data science and\ncomputer vision lessons and see you in\nthe next video take care\n[Music]\n",
