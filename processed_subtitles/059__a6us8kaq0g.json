  "text": "What is cloud computing? So that is the topic \nof this video. Now you may have heard of people  \ntalking about the cloud, such as cloud computing \nor cloud storage, but you probably weren't sure  \nexactly what it was. Well, the term cloud computing \nrefers to data and applications being stored and  \nrun on the cloud rather than being stored and run \non your local computer or on any equipment that  \nyou own. Then this data and the applications which \nare on the cloud are accessed through the internet  \nSo the workload is no longer on your computer or \non any equipment that you own, it's on the cloud.  \nSo what is the cloud?  Now to put it simple, the \ncloud is just a big building that's filled  \nwith computers.  To be specific, it's a big building \nfilled with servers and servers are just computers  \nthat provide services on behalf of clients.  Now \nthese buildings are very large, and well they have  \nto be, because when you take a look inside, it's a \ngiant data center that contains servers as far as  \nthe eye can see.  And these servers perform numerous \ntasks, such as running applications, storing data,  \ndata processing, web hosting, and so on.  And they \nare also all networked together and they can be  \naccessed on the internet.  So what is the purpose of \na cloud?  Well, the companies that own these clouds  \nare called cloud providers and their purpose is to \nsell their computers as a service.  Now a service is  \njust something that you pay someone to do for you \nrather than doing the job yourself.  So if a person  \nor a company wanted to hire another company \nto do part or all of their computing workload,  \nthey would outsource it to a third party.  In\nother words, they would use cloud computing  \nSo back in the old days before cloud computing and \nas an example we'll use email.  So at your home or  \noffice if you wanted to use email you would have \nyour own physical email server.  So you would have  \na server, an operating system, and email software \nsuch as Microsoft exchange.  And then after some  \nconfiguration , you would be able to use email. \nBut the problem is, is that if anything goes  \nwrong with the server, such as a hardware failure \nor a software problem , or if the operating system  \ncrashed, then you would be responsible for fixing \nthe problem, not to mention any maintenance that is  \nneeded to keep the server up and running. However \nyou do have the option of eliminating all the  \nhassle and upkeep of your own email server and \nhave another company host all of your email on  \ntheir servers in the cloud for you, such as gmail \nhotmail and a bunch of others.  But email is just  \none example of cloud computing.  There are also \nother services such as productivity software,  \nweb servers, databases, and even Youtube.   So yes \nyou as an individual can use Youtube as a cloud  \nSo if you're a video creator and instead \nof building and maintaining your own video  \nserver and software and the extreme high cost of \ninternet bandwidth that you would need for people  \nto watch your videos from your server, you can \nbypass that and you can just upload your videos  \nto Youtube and let Youtube handle everything for \nyou.  But instead of directly paying youtube like a  \nregular cloud provider, Youtube will get a share of \nthe ad revenue generated by your videos.  So another  \nquestion is, why would an individual or a company \nuse cloud computing?  Well as I just mentioned a  \nmajor reason is cost.  With cloud computing a person \nor company eliminates a lot of the expense of  \nbuying their own hardware and software, along \nwith the building maintenance and electricity  \nit takes to run their own data center.  So it would \nbe more cost efficient to use a cloud instead.  \nAnd another reason is reliability.  Because when you \nhire a cloud, the cloud provider is responsible for  \nall of the data backup and disaster recovery.  And \nif one of its data centers goes down, they will  \nalso have several redundant sites as a backup \nwhich will ensure that there is no downtime.  And \nanother reason is scalability.  Cloud providers will \noffer a 'pay as you go' method where you can pay for  \nonly what you need.  So whether you need to rent \na few computers or a lot, it doesn't matter.  So if  \nyou only want to rent a small amount of computers \nto start out, you can do that.  But as your business  \nexpands, you have the option of instantly \nrenting more computers to suit your needs  \nAnd if you don't need to rent as many computers, \nyou can instantly scale back to renting only a few  \nSo who are the cloud providers today?  Well \nthe major cloud providers today are Amazon  \nWeb Services or (AWS).   Microsoft Azure,  Google Cloud Platform, Alibaba, and IBM.  With Amazon Web Services  \nbeing the biggest of them all - taking about a third \nof the cloud market share.  In fact one of AWS' \nbiggest customers is Netflix.  Netflix uses Amazon Web Services for nearly all of its computer and  \nstorage needs including databases, analytics ,video \ntranscoding, and so on.  So instead of building its  \nown data center and spending hundreds of millions \nof dollars on hosting its own data, Netflix chose  \nto outsource it to a cloud provider which is \nAmazon.  So a major advantage that Netflix has  \nof using a cloud is that they don't have to worry \nabout downtime, security, data backup, or the high  \ncost of building and maintaining their own data \ncenter.  They can just pay Amazon to do it for them  \nSo this takes a tremendous burden off of Netflix \nwhich allows them to focus on other things  \npertaining to their business.  Now there are \nthree different types of cloud computing. There's  \ninfrastructure as a service or (IaaS).  Platform as a \nservice or (PaaS) and Software as a service or (SaaS). \nAnd these three vary in control and flexibility. \nSo it's up to the user to decide what suits their  \nneeds.  So the first one is infrastructure as a \nservice.  Now this type is basically where you're  \ngoing to let the cloud provider manage a portion \nof your business which is going to be the hardware  \nportion.  The cloud provider will manage the servers, \nstorage, virtualization, and the networking portion.  \nYou on the other hand will still have control over \nthe software portion.  Such as the applications, data,  \noperating system, middleware, and runtime.  Some \nexamples of infrastructure as a service that  \nthe common person would use would be online data \nbackup services, such as iDrive and Carbonite that  \nprovide cloud storage.  And the next one is called \nplatform as a service.  Now (PaaS) like (IaaS) allows  \nthe cloud provider to manage a portion of your \nbusiness.  But the cloud provider has more control.  \nIn a (PaaS) the cloud provider not only manages the \nhardware such as servers, storage, and networking, but  \nit also manages the operating system, middleware, \nand runtime.  You on the other hand are only  \nresponsible for the applications and the data.\nAnd finally there's software as a service or (SaaS)  \nNow this is probably the most common cloud \nservice by far.  In this type, all the applications  \nare hosted by the cloud provider.  There is no \nsoftware to install on your computer and no  \nhardware to manage.  You just simply access and \nrun the application from your computer when you  \nconnect to the cloud service through the internet. \nSo the cloud provider manages all the hardware,  \nsoftware, networking, operating system, and storage. \nA good example of (SaaS) is something that I use  \nall the time, which is Google Docs.  Google \nDocs is a free online office suite that is  \naccessed using a web browser.  There is no \nadditional software that needs to be installed  \non your computer to use Google Docs.  Everything \nis accessed and managed from your web browser. \nSo this concludes the video on cloud computing. \nPlease subscribe and thank you for watching.\n",
