  "text": "The Internet of Things\nis the giant network\nof interconnected devices\nfrom these devices are capable\nof making decisions\nwithout any human intervention.\nEdureka welcome you\nto the full course session\non the internet of things\nand what follows is a series\nof fundamental concepts\non the internet of things\nwhich will help you\nget started with IoT.\nBut before we begin let's look\nat our agenda for today.\nso we can start out\nwith introducing you\nto the concept of iot.\nWe are going to discuss.\nWhy do you need I will take\nwhat is iot of you benefits\nof iot for biofuel features\nand finally the very\nimportant five layer\narchitecture of authority.\nThen you're going to discuss\nRaspberry Pi in this section.\nWe are going to talk\nabout why you need Raspberry Pi\nwhat does Raspberry Pi\nof you Hardware specifications\nand the installation\nof Rosman fire also,\nThis module.\nWe have a few demos\nincluding the Raspberry Pi\na few cents hats and\nRaspberry Pi camera module.\nNext.\nWe are going to discuss\nthe top seven projects\nin iot in this section.\nWe're going to talk\nabout the best projects\nthat we found in Rog next.\nWe will talk about iot devices\nare going to talk\nabout various devices\nwhich came into Inception\nafter the concept\nof iot was introduced\nthen we want to talk\nabout iot applications\nin this Section we\nare going to discuss\npractical applications of iot\nin various domains\nsuch as Healthcare\nsecurity traffic governance.\nSo on and so forth and finally\nwe are going to discuss\nall things career in Ironton.\nThey're going to talk\nabout the job market\nthe opportunity the salary\nin different geographies\nand experience so on\nand so forth,\nbut that we come to the end\nof our agenda also going to take\nup this time to subscribe to us\nand don't forget to hit that\nBell icon to double missile.\nUpdate from The Edge\nArabia YouTube channel.\nSo without Much Ado,\nlet's get started\nwhat is internet of things\nnow to help you understand\nwhat is internet of things?\nLet's look at an example\nof a mobile phones Forest.\nOkay.\nOur mobile phones\nhas GPS tracking.\nIt also has mobile gyroscope\nyou have adaptive brightness,\nwhich gets adjusted\nbased on the light falling on it\nyou have voice recognition.\nAnd you also have face detection\nwhich identifies who is\nthe user now again iPhone x\nis coming with face detection.\nSo again, these are\na lot of features\nthat are coming pre-built\non the mobile asset\nand most of these have a common\ninteraction between them\nbecause let's say\none application can use all\nof these features.\nI can also have these features\nin itself being interacting\nwith each other.\nLet's say based\non a GPS location.\nMy brightness could be adjusted\nor based on the direction.\nMy phone is being held\nthe brightness in itself\ncan also The adjusted as well.\nSo there are a lot of features\nbut when they interact\nwith each other these features\ncome together to bring\nin a better system\nthat anything\nthat they can\nprovide individually\nas such that's what internet\nof things is it\nbasically is a platform\nwhere we can connect\nevery day things\nwhich are embedded\nwith either Electronics software\nor sensors to the internet\nand this in turn enables us\nto collect as well as exchange\nbetween these things.\nNow when I say things it\ncan be anything and Nothing,\nlet's say I have\nan internet platform where\nand I can connect these things\nif I take the example\nof my house,\nI can connect my lock.\nI can connect my AC.\nI can connect my light\nand all this can be managed\non the same platform\nsince I have a platform\nso I can also connect\nmy car to this.\nI can keep a track\nof my fuel meter.\nI can keep a track\nof my speed limit.\nI can also keep track\nof the location\nof the car as well.\nNow if there is\na collective platform\nwhere all of these are connected\nwouldn't it be great\nbecause I would love\nto Of the AC on and set\na cool temperature\nat my home by the time\nI reach back from office\nif I have a platform\nthat knows my preference and\nthat keeps track of where I am\nand where I'm going\nto then it can also identify\nthat I'm going\nfrom work back to Hope\nand my preference suggest\nthat it would be best\nif there was an easy\ntemperature of about\n22 or 23 degree centigrade\nand this is something\nthat is definitely possible\nthrough internet of things.\nNow, this is just one\nof the examples now,\nlet's say tomorrow\nyou come back.\nHome, it would be great.\nIf I wouldn't even need\na key to unlock my door\nmy home system should be aware\nthat I have come home\nand should unlock all the doors\nthat are needed.\nAnd now this can be done\nif my mobile and my home\ndevices are connected\nonto the same platform based\non the location of my mobile.\nIt can identify\nthat I am at my hope\nso it will automatically\nunlock the door and let\nme come in as well.\nThese are some\nof the real world implications\nof Internet of Things.\nThese are something\nthat are already happening\nbut going forward\nwhat Need to understand is\nthat when I have\na specific component with me,\nwhich can do a lot individually\nwouldn't it be great\nif I can collaborate\nthis complaint with my system\nof different components\nand build up at a system.\nThis is what internet\nof things is helping us to okay,\nyou provide a platform to which\nall these things are connected\nthrough the internet.\nSo internet becomes the medium\nthrough which you're connecting\nall these components were\nthings to a platform.\nMoving forward let's\ntry to understand.\nWhy do we need internet\nof things now to help\nyou understand why let's look\nat an example.\nThis is a patient at home.\nOkay, he's on constant\nlife-support wearing.\nHis status is being checked\nto a health monitoring system\npresent on the cloud.\nLet's say at a point\nthere is certain issue\nwith respect to his health.\nLet's say there's some\nirregularity with his heartbeat\nor his blood pressure is low.\nThere's some fluid being\ndeveloped or so far now what?\nOffenses since the system\non the cloud is connected\nto a hospital as well.\nThis information would\nget passed on\nto the hospital as well.\nThey're in what would happen is\nthat they would get\nthe complete details\nwith respect to the patient\nand the important\ninformation with respect\nto the current situation\nof the patient as well.\nWe made it aware with respect\nto what issue exactly is\nthe patient facing\nas well as enable\nthem to dispatch an ambulance\nimmediately to bring the patient\nback to the hospital as well.\nNow meanwhile,\nonce the patient\nhas been picked up\nand brought back to the hospital\nthere could be prescriptions.\nThere could be medicine.\nThey could also be\nan operating theater made ready\nin case of an emergency\nsituation as well.\nThere'd be doctors on standby\nwho have the complete\nhistory of the patient\nwho have the complete details\nof the present condition\nof the patient as well.\nSo this in turn brings\nin a lot of transparency\nand reduces a lot of effort\nand time involved with respect\nto this same thing.\nLet's take in today's scenario.\nThere has to be someone\nwandering this patient's health.\nIf there's a fluctuation they\nneed to call the hospital they\nneed to call request\nfor an ambulance.\nAnd meanwhile,\nonce the ambulance is here.\nThey take the patient\nand their back into the hospital\nthen again there needs\nto be a lot of checkups\nthat need to be done\nbecause the doctors are\nnot fully aware again.\nThere is a lot of tests\nthat need to be run\nand this in turn leads\na lot of delay as well\nin certain emergency cases\nas such if a system can do\nthis then this is exactly\nwhere our future lies in and\nwhat we have to definitely\nmove forward to to now Internet\nof Things basically\nis expanding the interdependence\nof humans to interact contribute\nand collaborate with\nthings around us.\nNow.\nWhat do I mean by\ninterdependence of human see\nhow we depend on each other like\nhow I'm explaining\nthis concept to do\nif you're not clear you\nwould reach back to me.\nYou would request me for help.\nOkay, this becomes\nan interdependence between us\nwhen I'm giving you knowledge\nwhen you're not here\nyou're coming back to me\nand you're helping\nsimilarly tomorrow\nif there's something\nthat you can do for me,\nI would reach out to you.\nWe all are interdependent\non each other for something\nor the other\nif we can expand\nthis interdependence\nto interact collaborate\nand contribute with respect to\nthe different things around us.\nThen we would be building\na proper Internet\nof Things environment.\nThis would be a much more\nsafer secure effortless\nand time-saving environment\ninto existence moving forward.\nLet's Talk about the various\nbenefits of Internet of things.\nNow.\nThe first thing\nthat would be as a benefit\nof having an Internet\nof Things platform would\nthat you could efficiently\nutilize the resources\nthat are available\nif I have a smart system\nwhich can interact\nwith everything if it has\nenough computational power\nif it has enough understanding\nof how things work\nbetween each other.\nI'm quite sure the usage\nof the resources available\nwill be more efficient as well.\nThis resource could be\nin terms of monetary.\nIt could be in terms\nof natural resource it.\nAlso be an input taken\nup by the thing as\nan input and so far.\nOkay.\nSo all this can\nbe more efficient\nif I have a platform\nwhich is more smarter\nand interconnected as well apart\nfrom this it minimizes\nthe human effort involved\nif my system is smart enough\nto interact it to filter smart\nenough to do things\nthat I do need to get involved\nwith then my interaction\nis always going to be minimum.\nThis is same with everyone and\nthat's one of the major reasons\nwhy Internet of Things\nhas become popular today.\nThe and the concept\nof smart home is always growing\nas well in the same perspective\nbecause if the system in itself\nis able to do most of my work\nat hope then I don't need\nto put in much effort.\nI can relax at home without\nhaving to worry about anything.\nOkay, the next benefit\nwould be it saves time.\nIf it rains my human effort\ndefinitely it is going\nto save my time.\nOkay apart from that\nif the resources are utilized\nmore efficiently then again,\nit is going to save\na lot more time as well.\nAll-in-all any benefit\nof Internet of things\nwill in turn help you save\na lot of time as well.\nOkay.\nSo time is one\nof the major factor\nthat can be saved on an Internet\nof Things platform.\nNow if I have an artificial\nintelligence platform\nthrough which all\nof this is managed\nand maintained then\nthe personalization\nand the human touch also\ncomes into the picture.\nNow today most of us\nhave had a level of interaction\nwith an artificial intelligence\nor a virtual\nintelligence as well.\nThis could be\na personal assistant\nlike see Hurry,\nor it could be\nan assistance application\nlike Google assist now\nif I have system\nwhere all these components\nand things are interconnected\nthen in turn all\nthe security present\non each of these things\nis going to get multiplied\nand it's going to build a much\nmore secure system apart\nfrom that the level of security\nthat we would be integrating\nto the platform in itself\nis going to be quite huge.\nSo the overall security\nbooth respect to everything\nis going to increase\nmultiple times as well.\nNow let's look at some\nof the major features\nof Internet of things.\nNow any technology\nthat is available\ntoday has not reached\nits hundred percent capabilities\nand it always has\nthat Gap to grow Internet\nof Things is one\nof the major Technologies\nin the world today\nthat can help any other\ntechnology reach its true\nand complete potential as well.\nNow there are mainly three\naspects to Internet of Things.\nThings as to how it works first\nis the connect aspect here.\nBasically, what you need\nto work on is you need to ensure\nthat there is a connectivity\nbetween all the things\naround you all the necessary\nthings to The Internet\nof Things platform.\nOkay, then comes analyze now,\nI have my things around me.\nThey each are going\nto generate some amount\nof data now this data\nneeds to be collected\nand it needs to be\nanalyzed to build\na business intelligence solution\nif I have a good insight,\nThe data that is gathered\nfrom all of this then\ndefinitely I can call\nmy system as a smart system.\nFinally what happens is\nin order to improvise\nand improve your system.\nYou need to integrate it\nwith various models to improve\nthe users experience as well.\nLet's say there's\na personalization module\nthat is there or let's say\nthere's going to be an aspect\nwhen I can directly\nconnect to my providers.\nNow.\nThis provider could be Amazon.\nIt could be Flipkart.\nIt could also be my retail store\nthat is next to me.\nLet's say I'm out of milk\nto retail store\nwill get a notification\nand he would send\nmilk right away\nand the same thing can be done.\nLet's say I have my coffee\nmachine requires special beans\nand this be isn't is\nalmost complete then\nwhat my system could do\nis it could go online\nto Amazon and purchase\nthese beans for me as well.\nSo there are a lot\nof things that I can do\nwhen I integrate this\nwith respect to various models\nand improve the overall\nexperience to a single user\nor a group of users\non the world itself such.\nOkay.\nNow, let's talk\nabout each one of One\nby one let's start with connect.\nNow.\nThe first stage of connect\nis device virtualization\nbecause what you\nneed to First do is\nthat you need to standardize\nthe integration of the device\nto the Enterprise platform,\nwhich is present on the flower.\nOkay.\nNow, it could be present\non a cloud it could be present\non a so, but again,\nit's all going to be connected\nthrough the internet.\nSo what I need to do is\nthat I need to ensure\nthat certain level of standard\nis present on the device\nso that it can go on\nand connect to my Internet\nof Things platform.\nNow to help you\nunderstand this better,\nthere could be a standard\npower plug and there could be\na power block which has\nan inbuilt Wi-Fi support\nso that it can\nconnect to my lap.\nNo to build a smart home system.\nI need the second power point\nbecause there only I would have\nthe access to control it\nover the internet\nand my system could integrate\nwith respect to the same.\nOkay.\nNow if I take the first\nstandard PowerPoint then\nwhat would happen is\nthat I need to manually\nswitch it on and switch it\non how in the second case\nI could send a signal to it\nand In don't we'll switch it on\nand switch it off.\nSo there's supposed to be\na level of standardization\nthrough which I can integrate\nall of these devices\nto my platform.\nNext comes high-speed messaging.\nSo now what I have done is\nthat I have connected all\nthese devices to my platform\nbut these devices in turn\ngenerate a lot of data\nand this data is\nwhat is going to help\nus understand better\non how we can improve\nthe overall system\nand help and provide the user\nwith better experience.\nSo for that we need\nto To have high-speed messaging.\nOkay.\nThis basically means\nthat there needs to be\na reliable secure\nand a bidirectional\ncommunication Channel\nbetween the devices\nand the platform not the purpose\nof it being bidirectional is\nbecause you need to control\neach one of them as well.\nLet's say I want to switch\non the AC then the signal\nwould be going on\nfrom the cloud platform\nto the device.\nSo this is how it works on.\nOkay.\nSo every communication\nneeds to be reliable\nit needs to be secure\nand it needs to be\nbi-directional as well.\nMoving on to the third point\nof connect you need\nto have endpoint management.\nIf I don't have\nan endpoint manager,\nI have established a way\nthrough which all my devices\ncan connect to my platform.\nI also ensured\nthat the data\nis going to be sent\nfrom the device to the cloud\nand the cloud can send back\nto the device as well\nthrough a secure Channel,\nbut if I don't actually identify\nfrom which device\nwhich data is coming\nand how this data\nhas to be processed.\nThen it becomes a failure\nof the system.\nThis is where Management comes\ninto picture endpoint management\nbasically helps you\nin managing the devices\nendpoint identity the metadata\nand the overall life cycle\ninvolved with respect\nto these things are such.\nOkay, so to put it quite simply\nit basically helps you identify\nfrom which device\nwhich data is coming\nand what needs to be done\nwith this data as well.\nNow coming on to the next\nfeature is analyzed\nand the first thing that you\nneed to do for analysis,\nis this reprocessing now\nif the data coming from the\ndevice Not on a real-time basis,\nthen my system\nis often Williams.\nThere's no use\nif I tell my system to switch\non the AC at my home.\nAnd by the time I reach there\nif the AC is not even\nturned on then it's\na failure on my system.\nOkay, so real-time analysis\nof the incoming and outgoing\ndata and must be done.\nI have with respect\nto different aggregations\nit filtering correlations\nprocessing and so far.\nOkay now apart from this\nwhat you need to do is\nthat this is raw data\nthat is being streamed\nfrom all the things you need.\nNeed to identify\nwhich is contextually\nimportant information\nwhich is going\nto be taken forward.\nSo once I have\nthe irrelevant information,\nthen I can even generate\ncomposite streams of information\nwhich can be taken ahead\nfor future analysis\nand understanding as well.\nThis is what your data\nenrichment process does.\nThen you have events\nto now in events\nto basically any information\nthat you want can be queried\nand visualized from\nthe vast amount of data\nwhich is present on my cloud.\nOkay.\nNow this in turn\ncan also help me get\na better insight and Analysis\nif I have all the enriched data\npresent on my cloud platform.\nI have a tool\nwhich helps me identify\nwhat is needed help me analyze.\nThis data helps me visualize\nit then definitely it becomes\nmore useful as well.\nAnd when I have data coming\nfrom different things as such\nthis in turn can also lead\nto being a collection\nof big data now\nwhen I talk about Big Data,\nit's not just a few GB of data\nas it's going to be\nterabytes of data because\nbecause the data generated\nfrom the things around us is\nthat was and if you doing it\nover a period of time then\ndefinitely it is going to grow\ninto a big data domain as well.\nNow coming to the third feature\nof Internet of Things\ncomes Enterprise connectivity.\nSo this is what I\nwas basically telling you about.\nLet's say I have a requirement\nfrom my retailer or even\nan Enterprise organization\nwhich is present.\nIt could be Amazon.\nIt could be flipcard anything as\nas any Enterprise organization\nwhich provides me a service.\nIf I can connect to them\nthrough this platform,\nthen definitely My\noverall process also\nbecomes easier as well.\nLet's say this is\nservice provider.\nOkay, let's say there is\na leakage in my Plumbing\nor let's say there's some issue\nwith respect to my electricity.\nThen it can contact to the\ncorresponding service provider.\nIt can send them a detail\nand corresponding they\nwould be dispatched.\nThis would in turn\nreduce my effort\nof having to check the problem\nhaving to call someone wait\nfor them to come back all\nthat gets reduced to minimum\nrequired effort as well.\nWell, now how does\nthis communication happen?\nSo for that we have rest API.\nOkay.\nOnce I've integrated\nmy rest API with respect\nto the cloud application\nand my internet of things\nthen communication between\nthe Enterprise communication\nbetween the platform\nand the communication\nbetween the things around us\ncan be made more efficient\nand can be more easy as\nper the third aspect\nis command and control\nif I don't have command\nand control on my platform\nthen it's awful noise.\nYes, I built a very great.\nTable something that's\nquite extraordinary.\nBut if you cannot command it\nif I cannot control it as\nper my requirement,\nthen the system\nin itself is not useful\nif I cannot tell my door\nin a smart home to unlock\nwhen I want it then it\nbecomes failure on my part.\nIf I cannot control the AC\non my horse motto then again,\nit's a failure.\nSo always the major aspect\nwhen you integrate\nwith respect to these things.\nThe major thing is\nthat you need to ensure there's\na huge control on system\nand you're able to Um\nand it as per your requirement\nnow this command could either be\nthrough a voice\nbased recognition.\nIt could also be a message\nthat you can send\nthrough your mobile application\nand so forth as well\nwhen we come down\nto the iot ecosystem.\nThere's no single\nconsensus or again.\nThere's no singles\narchitectural design\nthat's out there\nwhich is agreed universally\nbecause each company\neach organization each user\nfor that matter has\ndifferent requirements\nand We look down to it.\nWe can break it down to a simple\nthree level architecture\nwhere and we have\na perception layer\nwhere centers actually\ngather the information\nfrom the environment around it.\nOkay.\nOnce this is done\nI'm going to use I'm going\nto pass this information\nto the network layer\nthe network layer in itself\ntakes up the responsibility\nof transferring this data\nfrom the sensors\nto the next layer,\nwhich is the application layer\nnow here the main objective\nof the responsibility\nis the application\nin itself delivers\nthis information to the end user\nor the When platform for\nthat matter this architecture\ncan also be expanded\nto a five layer architecture.\nNow when I talk\nabout a five layer architecture,\nit's quite similar here.\nIt's a the difference mostly\ncomes around with respect\nto the transport layer\nthe processing layer\nand the business\nlayer mostly here\nwhen we had three layers\ndoing the earlier task.\nWe've just broken this down\nso that we have\nan easier operation\nor a smoother system\nfor that matter.\nNow again, the perception\nlayer remains same\nwhen it gathers the information\nfrom the sensors,\nbut the transport layer\nactually Transports the data\nbetween the sensor\nto the processing center.\nNow, this could be\nthrough a wireless system.\nIt could be through Bluetooth.\nIt could be two RFID\n3G NFC or any medium\nthat I choose to once.\nThe information has been\ntransmitted the processing layer\ncomes into picture\nwhich actually stores the\nrelevant information analyzes\nthis and again processes it as\nper the users requirement.\nNow again, this could\nemploy various databases\nCloud Computing Services as\nwell as big data\nprocessing modules\nto store this information\nas as well as process\nit for that matter.\nOnce this is done.\nI give the information\nto the application layer,\nwhich is actually responsible\nfor delivering Superior Services\nto the end user for that matter\non top of all of this\nstands your business lamp now\nany device for that matter\nwhen it is working\non a large-scale environment\na business layer\nis usually used here.\nNow, let's say I'm working\nin an organization\nwhere we using multiple pumps\nfor different views features\nin different locations\nfor that matter a business layer\nhere actually monitors\nthe complete functioning\nof these parts.\nYou can also have these\nin various cars as well.\nSo what do I would note here is\nif a car is going to break\ndown then I also get\nan awareness with respect\nto that individual car\nand it also helps me enable\nor help me reach out to\nthe closest customer care center\nso that it can assist\nthe user coming down\nto how I can process it again.\nThis can be divided\ninto two segments.\nI have my cloud computing\nbased processing.\nWe're in here.\nIt's quite simple\nonce I have the information.\nI pass it on\nto the cloud platform\nwhich then in turn also.\nProcesses it and also has\nvarious applications to deal\nwith this process information\nfor that matter.\nNow again, this is something\nthat I can do on a system\nwhich does not require\nany immediate action\nand requires a large amount\nof processing for that segment.\nBut let's say I am in a system\nwhere I need immediate\nresponse in those cases,\nI can go with my\nfor computing now again\nfor computing is something\nthat represents a layered\napproach wherein we actually\ninsert monitoring pre processing\nand storage with\nthe security layer.\nBetween the physical\nand the transport lab.\nLet me just go back\na few slides here to help\nyou understand this.\nNow.\nIf you actually look my\nfor composedly comes\nbetween these two layers\nwhen I add four new layers\nfor that matter.\nNow again, this is used in order\nto make a system quite smarter\nor effective with respect to it\nnow between my physical layer\nand my transport lab,\nI have a monitoring layer.\nI have a pre-processing layer\na storage layer and\na security line now to help\nyou understand this.\nLet's take in real-world\nexample out them.\nLet's say I have\na complete traffic system.\nWhich is built\non my internet of things.\nNow, let's say at one point.\nThere is an ambulance\nthat has come to a first signal\nI detect this and what I do is\nthat I allow the ambulance\nto move from this traffic signal\nby giving it a green line,\nbut what you need\nto understand is\nif I'm using a cloud\ncomputing this message has\nto be passed on to the cloud.\nThis information has\nto be then process\nand then correspondingly a map\nhas all stood to be created\nat the same time\nwhen I use a fog approach\nwhat happens is\nthat all the pre-processing\nand the storage happens\non the Gateway level itself.\nThe information from the sensor\ngoes all the way\nto the Gateway there\nand it actually processes this\nstores the relevant information\nand sends this back\nto the discourage\nponding sensors as well.\nSo let's say if there's\nan immediate track\nthat I can create\nto the closest hospital.\nI would highlight all\nthe traffic signals to be green\nso that the ambulance can move\nsmoothly as well now security\nhere is very essential\nbecause if I implement\nthis tomorrow anyone can\nactually try to manipulate this\nfor their requirements as well.\nImagine there is a high High\nSpeed police chase happening\nand the culprit uses this\nin order to move fast\nfrom the traffic signal.\nSo this is something\nthat is really Ascension.\nAlthough there is a pro to this.\nThere's also a con and this is\nhow we try to overcome\nthis issue now talking\nabout each one\nof these new layers\nwhen I come\nto the monitoring layer.\nWhat it actually does is it\nmonitors the power consumption\nit monitors each\nof these resources as\nwell as their response\nand the services\nthat are running\non these resources.\nNow this in turn\nhelps me monitor\nor gives me a complete idea.\nOf which other services are\nwhich are the sensors\nwhich are working?\nWhere are the challenges?\nWhat is the power consumption\nand how it works with respect\nto that same now\nonce I have information\nfrom these sensors\nwhat you need to understand is\nthat usually you work\nwith thousands of sensors\nin a real-world environment.\nNow, I need to understand which\nare the necessary information.\nSo I'm going to do a level\nof filtering I'm going\nto do a level of processing\nand then I'm going\nto apply a level\nof analytics to understand\nwhat is needed\nand what is not from\nthese information as well now.\nNow the temporary storage area\nis something that I use\nin case I want to store\nany relevant information.\nLet's say I'm creating a route\ntoday for an ambulance as well.\nAnd this is going to be stored\nin my temporary storage area.\nBut this also needs to be used\nin future scenarios.\nSo once I am done\nwith this usage,\nI can also push it\nonto the next transport layer\nwhich can send it\nto any other storage system\nthat has part of my environment.\nNow as I said security plays\na very important role,\nalthough my for\ncomputing is something\nthat makes my system faster.\nIt should not be easily.\nInaudible now in\na cloud-based system.\nI have the assurance\nthat it's not really easy\nto break down the security.\nIt's quite hard where there are\nvarious layers of security\nwhich are part of the system.\nBut when I have a fork system,\nit's essential that\nthis factor or the security\nwhich deals with the encryption\nwhich deals with the privacy\nof the information.\nThe Integrity of this\ninformation is maintained.\nNow, there's also a very\ninteresting variation of this\nwhich is called an edge\nComputing system wherein\nrather than doing all\nthese operations are\nAfter I have gathered\nthis on the Gateway,\nI can do it\non the individual notes\nor individual sensors as well\nwith respect to it.\nSo where I have edges\nthese becomes point\nfor me to perform\noperations on the data\nthat is being collected.\nSo that's the slide variation\nof our for computing system\nis such next let's talk\nabout the various\ntaxonomy associated\nwith internet of the X.\nNow.\nThese are the key Concepts\nor these are the key layers\nwhich are present with respect\nto most architectures.\nThat's out there.\nAs I said,\nthis is a general\nguide ER e Person\non each system that's out.\nThere requires its own level\nof customization requires\nits own level of approach\nto solve that problem.\nBut these always remain\nthe fundamental layers\nwhich are included\nin all the architectures\nout there first.\nWe have the perception layer,\nwhich is usually the layer\nwhere we gather the information\nfrom the various sensors\nthat's out there or we\nuse the various sensors\nwhich are required as\npart of our system.\nThen we have\nthe processing layer\nwhere in we perform filtration.\nWe summarize the data\nwe again do a level\nof analytics on This data\nbefore we decide to send\nthis relevant data to the system\nthat's above this.\nNow.\nThen I have a communication line\nof communications layer\nis very simple\nas in here will\nDefine the protocols\nand standards as\nwell as the medium\nthrough which the information\nhas to be passed from my sensors\nto my main system\nas well middleware is something\nthat's quite essential here.\nWhat it does is\nthat it creates\nan abstraction as well\nas it makes my system work\nmuch more smoother.\nNow what you need\nto understand is\nthat there are various\ncomponents in what hear me?\nThat really helps\nme integrate the information\ncoming out from each\nof these sensors or each\nof these individual systems.\nOnce it's present\nthat I can pass it on\nto my application layer where\nand I have various applications\nwhich help to improve\nthe overall experience\nof the user as well as\nprovide much more accuracy and\nefficiency to the information\nthat's present now coming down.\nLet's talk about each layer\none by one now\nbefore I talk about\nthe perception layer\nwhat you need to understand is\nthat one of the most\nimportant aspects of Annette\nof things is context awareness.\nThat is what you need\nto understand with respect\nto the change of environment\nis very important.\nAnd this is extremely impossible\nwithout the usage of sensors\nas such now sensors\nin themselves are\nvery small in size.\nThey again cost you very little\nand at the same time they\nconsume very little power again.\nThere are various constraints\nwith respect to the factors\nas the battery capacity\nand the ease\nof deployment as well,\nbut let's not go\ninto them as such.\nNow when I talk\nabout sensors again,\nwe have various types\nof sensors as such one of\nthe easiest example of sensors\nthat can be seen\non a daily basis is the sensors\nwhich are part of your mobile.\nYou have a location sensor you\nhave movement sensor camera\nin itself is actually\nanother sensor your microphone\nyour light sensor.\nThese are all various important\naspects of your mobile\nthat we use on a daily basis\napart from this neural\nsensors medical sensors,\nlike the fitness bands\nthat we use Healthcare bands,\nwhich are used\nfor heart patients.\nIn environmental sensors,\nwhich check the temperatures\naround the environment make\nyou aware of the changes\nchemical or biosensors\nwhich are very useful\non a daily basis\nas 12 again infrared\nsensors are something\nthat's quite common as well.\nWhen we talk about RFID.\nThis is something\nthat's really important or not.\nThis is something\nthat really gathers a lot\nof attention with respect\nto it RFID stands\nfor radio frequency\nidentification now\nunlike a traditional barcode.\nIt does not actually require\na line of sight of communication\nbetween the tags.\nAnd the reader\nand can identify itself\nfrom a distance without even\na human intervention\nor a human operation\nfor that matter RFID\nis are technically\nof two types you have active\nand passive active tags actually\nhave some amount of power source\nassociated with it\nand passive sources do not have\nanything related to it.\nAnd when we talk about\nthe RFID Technologies as well,\nthere's near and far\nand near RFID reader uses\na coil through which we\nactually pass AC current\nand Create a magnetic field.\nNow when we generate\na magnetic field anything\nthat comes in its vicinity it\nregisters with respect to it.\nNow when I talk about afar\nRFID it basically is\na dipole antenna in a reader.\nNow this again propagates\nan electromagnetic waves and tax\nthemselves also have\na dipole antenna now again,\nthese are something that's used\nin various applications.\nThat's out there.\nNow one key factor,\nwhich is associated\nwith the perception layer\nis an actuator now\nwhen I talk about an actual It\nactually is a device\nwhich can affect a change\nin the environment\nby converting any sort\nof energy into another now.\nThis could be a motor\nwhich is generating electricity.\nThis could be a windmill\nwhich is converting\nthe wind outside to you\nto of electric form as\nwell in these are just some\nof the examples\nthat's out there\nand actuators themselves\nplay a very essential role\nin the perception lab now,\nthe next layer that we have\nis the pre-processing layer.\nBut before I really talk\nabout the pre-processing layer,\nlet's actually try to\nAnd the limitations of trying\nit to process everything\nthat we have\non the cloud system,\nwhich is part of our ecosystem.\nNow when I talk\nabout this one of the key\nor one of the biggest challenges\nfor me is mobility.\nLet's say my sensors are\non devices which are\nin constant motion.\nThen it becomes\na really high challenge\nfor me to pass\nthis information continuously\nto my cloud environment again,\nthis could be true the challenge\nof Transport layer.\nThis could also be due\nto the challenge\nof power consumption\nassociated with it\nwhen my Smart device\nor when my sensors\nfor that matter are\nin constant motion\nrun constant Mobility.\nThen it cannot completely pass\nall the relevant information\non to the cloud.\nNow.\nThis intern actually\ncauses a challenge\nfor me to have some latency.\nThis could also lead\nto early 10 C with respect\nto real time processing\nof the information\nthat it gets as well.\nNow if I'm working\non a critical system,\nthen real-time information is\nsomething that I will highly\ndepend on and that becomes\na challenge as well now.\nNow if I really want to scale up\nif I want to use a lot\nof devices then\nmy cloud computing system\nalso needs to scale\nbut there's always a chance\nto increase the latency\nbecause I'm working\nwith multiple sensors\nor multiple devices.\nThat's out there.\nImagine today.\nI have a system with just\nincludes thousands answers,\nbut let's say in a smart\nhome system There is close\nto about 10 to 20 thousand\nsensors associated with it.\nSo this is just\none small system.\nImagine if I'm trying to build\na smart city in that case.\nIs going to be hundreds of\nthousands millions of sensors\nthat's out there\nif my cloud computing system\ncannot process this\non a real-time.\nThen there's going\nto be a high challenge\nwith respect to that sick.\nAnd this is exactly\nwhere the usage of smart\ngateways comes into a picture.\nThis layer actually helps\nme process my data on real type.\nIt also helps me filter the data\non based on the priority\nor the requirement\nand creates a local copy\nof whatever is needed\nor whatever needs\nto be taken forward.\nWord now when I come\nto the pre-processing layer\nor when I come to the features\nof for computing\nfor this matter,\nthere's a very low latency\nbecause the information\ndoes not have to go\nto the cloud system\nwherein the processing\nneeds to be taken up.\nIt always is done\non the Gateway level itself.\nThis information really\nis faster as we've seen\nin the previous example\nabout the ambulance now,\nI can also use distributed nodes\nwhere in the information\ndoes not have to be\nother processing has to be\non one single node\nfor that matter\nwhen I'm using Distributed notes\nthen I can also distribute\nthe effort or the work\nthat is needed as well\nwhen I'm on a mobile\nenvironment as well.\nThese Smart Systems\ncan communicate with\nthe gateways present\nin its closest proximity.\nIt does not have to connect\nto just one single Gateway.\nIf I'm setting up gateways\nacross multiple points\nin my city,\nthen it makes it quite faster\nand more efficient\nand this in turn can also lead\nto a real-time response\nfrom the Gateway\nfor that matter.\nOnce I have\na real-time response,\nthen it is big.\nTaking my system faster and as\nin the previous example rather\nthan just clearing one signal.\nI can clear an entire path\nfor the ambulance as such now\nonce I have relevant\ninformation those\nwhich are necessary or those\nwhich are really something\nthat I need to ponder\nor I need to analyze can be sent\nto the cloud system as\nand when as it's needed as such\nso this is something\nthat really makes\nmy pre-processing layer\nimportant and efficient\nand effective coming\nto the next layer,\nwhich is the\nmost important layer.\nIt's out that which is\nmy communication lab now\nas your Internet of Things\nenvironment actually grows.\nThis is a compromise\nor this is a combination\nof various heterogeneous devices\nwhich are connected\nto the internet.\nWhat you need to understand is\nthat these devices\nin then self need\nto pass these informations\nand some of the challenges\nthat the communication layer\nshould actually address is\nwith respect to let's say\nfirst start off with addressing\nand identifying of each\nof these informations\nwherein I know\nwhich Each device is sending\nme the information.\nWhat is that device\nif I want to communicate back\nto that device as well.\nHow do I do that again?\nWhen it comes down\nto the communication in itself?\nThis should also not cost me\na huge amount of consumption\nwith respect to power because\nif I save up a lot\nof energy with respect to\nhow the information is gathered,\nbut I waste a lot of energy\nin transmitting this information\nthen I don't have a smart system\nagain information itself,\nwhich comes should\nuse various route.\nProtocols which actually\nrequire very low memory\nand should be very efficient\nfor that matter.\nIf the information\nitself needs to be bounced\naround different layers going\nfrom different segments\nof your Echo System,\nthen it needs to use\nvery less memory\nand this itself should be\nvery fast as well as seamless\nfor that matter.\nNow when I come down to each\nof these components\nfor that segment,\nlet's talk about NFC\nor the near field communication.\nNow NFC is actually\na very short-range\nWireless communication.\nTechnology through which usually\nmobiles interact with each other\nor a distance of a few\ncentimeters for that matter.\nNow all the type of data\ncan actually be transmitted\nbetween two NFC enabled devices\nin seconds by bringing\nthem close to each other.\nNow this in turn is actually\nbased on the RFID concept\nand it uses a variation\nof the magnetic field\nto communicate data\nbetween two NFC enabled devices.\nIf again, we go down\ninto slide specifications and FC\nusually works The frequency band\nof Thirteen point\nfive six megahertz.\nBut again, this is very similar\nto high frequency RF.\nId I'm not going to bore\nyou more with respect\nto the technical details will\ntalk about the next segment,\nwhich is your RFID and wsn\nintegration for smart objects.\nNow again, many a times\nwhat you need to\nunderstand is the data\nfrom one single sensor is\nactually not useful\nfor monitoring large areas\nand complex activities now here\nwhat you're going to use is\nthat you're going to use\nvarious sensor nodes to it.\nInteract with each other in this\nalso has to happen wirelessly.\nNow the disadvantage\nof a non IP technology such as\nRFID NFC or Bluetooth is\nthat it's range is very small,\nso they cannot be used\nin many applications wherein\nlarge area needs to be monitored\nthrough many sensor nodes\ndeployed in various locations\nfor that matter a wsn\nor a wireless sensor Network\nconsists of 10.\nMm sensor nodes connected\nusing a wireless technology.\nThey collect the data\nabout the environment\nand communicated to\nthe Gateway to Ice\nand relay the information\nto the cloud infrastructure\nover the internet as such now\nwhen I come down\nto the iot network protocol\nfor that matter,\nusually what you\nneed to understand is\nthat the IP for protocols\nthemselves can only\nbe used for communication\nof close to 20,000 device.\nNow again, the internet\nprotocols used by\nthese devices is something\nthat's quite a challenge as well\nbecause when you look at it,\nthe predicted amount of devices\nthat's going to be available\nby 2020 in The Internet\nof Things domain is\nClose to 40 billion imagine\n40 billion devices\ncommunicating with each other.\nNow if I don't have\na smart system or\nif I don't have\nan effective low power system,\nthen I cannot communicate\nor I cannot gather\nthe information from this now\nusually are low-power IPv6\nis used for these Network\non these communication\nwhich helps you in passing of\ninformation from these sensors\nonto your processing\nor onto your Cloud\ninfrastructure now again,\nwhen I come down to the low\nenergy technology my main,\nWith respect to communication\nis always to ensure\nthat low energy technology\nis most probably used\nin this segment.\nWe have your\nBluetooth low energy,\nwhich is usually\nreferred to as a ble\nand this was actually\ndeveloped by the Bluetooth\nspecial interest group.\nNow what you need\nto understand is\nthat it actually has a shorter\nrange for communication\nand consumes lower energy\nas compared to\nits Computing protocol.\nNow the BL a protocol stack\nis actually quite similar\nto the stack used\nin classic Bluetooth technology,\nhowever it As two parts,\nit has a controller\nand it has a host as well.\nNow the physical\nand the link layer are\nimplemented in the controller\nand the controller\nis typically an SOC\nor a system on chip\nwith a radio for communication.\nNow the functionality\nof the upper layers again\nare included in the host and BLS\nactually not compatible\nwith classic Bluetooth.\nNow, the next is a low-power.\nY5.\nNow.\nAgain, the Wi-Fi Alliance has\nrecently developed a Wi-Fi Halo,\nwhich is based\non your IEEE 802.11.\nIt had standards this\nin turn consumes,\nvery less power than compared\nto your standard.\nWi-Fi devices also\nhas a longer range.\nNow this exactly is why it is\nmost suitable for The Internet\nof Things applications\nfor that segment.\nNow any device\nthat supports Wi-Fi also\nsupports IP connectivity,\nwhich is very important\nfor an iot application\nfor that matter now.\nThe last is ZB ZB\nis also based on the IEEE\n802.15.4 Station protocol\nand is used mostly in\npersonal area networks or pan.\nNow again, the range\nfor zigbee devices\nto communicate is very small\nusually between 10 200 meters\nand the details of the network\nand the application layers\nare also specified\nby zigbee standards\nas such unlike the ble\nthe network layer which is part\nof the zigbee provides\nfor multi hopping routing the\nwhen I come down to more details\nabout this agree Network.\nI have three tabs\nwhich is an ffd full\nfunctional device and RF.\nReduce function device and\none zigbee coordinator as well.\nNow with this.\nI just hope you have\na simple understanding\nof how communication\nis essential for The Internet\nof Things architecture\nand the various ways\nthat you can implement\nthe communication\nbetween the devices as well.\nNow the next concept\nor the next layer with respect\nto the iot architecture is\nthe middleware segment.\nNow when I come down\nto the Middle where one\nof the key challenges and one\nof the key issues\nthat comes into the picture\nis the interoperability.\nOperate ability as well as\nthe program abstraction imagine.\nI have 40,000 devices\ncommunicating with each other\n40,000 devices may not all use\nthe same programming language\nor may not pass the information\nin the same way as well.\nI need to build or I need\nto have something that ensures\nthat these devices\ncommunicate with each other\nand there is\nan abstraction maintained\nbetween the information pass\nfrom these as well.\nNow if I have\nmultiple devices also\nwhat I need to ensure is\nthat these devices\nIndependently discoverable\nand I can manage\neach of them today.\nI need to be aware.\nIf one single sensor\nalso breaks down\nbecause the information\ncoming from the sensor is\nextremely important as well\nwhen it comes\ndown to scalability.\nIt is extremely useful\nbecause when I need to grow\nmy ecosystem this middleware\nreally comes into picture\nif I can replace\nan existing middleware\nwith something I\ncan help me scale up,\nthen I don't have to completely\nV8 my entire ecosystem as well\nwith respect to it\nusually When I use\na highly capable middleware,\nthen it also lets me perform\nbig data analytics\nand Implement security\nand privacy as well\nand this in turn usually\nhelps me communicate\nwith my cloud computing\nand also context\ndetection the again\nwhen you come down\nto the middleware segment,\nyou need to understand\nwith respect to\nthe various specifications\nof the application.\nWhich kind of database\nis it oriented.\nWhat is the semantics\nit's based on what kind\nof events can process\nand what kind of service\ncan it process or White ass\nbut these are some aspects\nthat you need to keep in mind\nwhile you're selecting\nyour middleware for\nyour architecture.\nNow the last layer is\nyour application lab Now\napplication is something\nthat really is\nwhat your end user gets or is\nwhat usually maintains\nor helps process\nyour information to the best\nthat's out there.\nNow this in turn can be used\nin different domains.\nIt can help you achieve\ndifferent things.\nIt can help you have\na smarter lifestyle it can help\nyou have a smarter environment\nyour entire home system\ncan be Managed\nwith respect to an application\nyour car management\ncan be done using application.\nYou can build\nan entire social life\nand entertainment system based\non a smart application now,\nalthough the end user\nusually only looks\nat the application layer.\nThis actually is the front face\nof your entire architecture.\nNow with this.\nI hope you at least\nhave gotten an idea\nof what the entire skeleton\nof your iot architecture\ncomprises of now\nwhat we have discussed\nhere is just the skeleton.\nIt's always up\nto the user to add.\nMuscles to it and complete\nit with a skin as\nper your requirement Raspberry\nPi today has become so common\nthat you can find it across\nmost households as well today.\nIt has become one\nof the most cheapest\nand common Computing device\nthat can be found\nalmost everywhere,\nbut let's actually go back\nto understand the ideology\nwhich bought Raspberry Pi\ninto development itself.\nNow Raspberry Pi basically\nwas bought by the Raspberry\nPi Foundation to Introduced\nor to bring in the information\ntechnology back to the schools\nwhere in students can learn\nhow to program\nfrom scratch the growth\nof technology today\nhas grown to such a level\nthat everyone today\nhas ease of access to do\nanything on a computer\nbut back in the early\nand late 90s and 2000 for using\na computer you needed to know\nhow to program and\nhow to work around\nwith respect to it.\nSo this in turn have to build\na very strong foundation\nfor programming knowledge\nAnd with the growth of UI\neverything has become so easy\nthat today you don't need\nto learn programming to do much.\nBut at the same time\nthis has made it harder\nfor people to identify\nand understand good programmers\nfrom those who are not.\nSo in order to\nbuild a generation\nwhich starts with a very\nstrong programming foundation\nand fundamentals.\nThe main ideology\nwas to introduce\nor take back it to the basics\nand make it accessible\nacross every school as well.\nAgain, as I said,\nit was introduced by\nthe Raspberry Pi foundation\nin 2012 as watching.\nThe moving forward what\nexactly is Raspberry Pi now.\nThis is one of the questions\nmost of you would have a cross\nyour mind as well because you\nmight have heard\nabout Raspberry Pi body\nmight still not have a Clarity.\nSo let me help you clarify\nthat right away.\nNow as per the definition\nRaspberry Pi basically\nis a series of very\nsmall single board computers,\nwhich actually have\nadditional features as\nBluetooth Wi-Fi USB capabilities\nGeneral input Output ports\nand so forth now it\nbasically is a very small\nlow-cost credit card computer\nwhich has actually\ncan be plugged\ninto any monitor as well as\nyou can include a keyboard\nand mouse and it\nincreases the opportunity\nfor people to explore\nlearn and understand\nhow to program as well.\nNow the latest version\nof Raspberry Pi\nis Raspberry Pi 3,\nwhich was released\nin February 2016 as well.\nNow Raspberry Pi\nbasically is a combination\nof raspberry operating And Pike\nwhich basically stands\nfor Python programming language.\nBut before we move forward,\nlet me just show you\na very simple video\nwhich Raspberry Pi has put out\nso that you can understand\nthe ideology of Raspberry\nPi Foundation as well.\nThis is a Raspberry Pi it's\na credit card sized computer\nthat costs around 25 pounds\ndesigned to teach\nyoung people's program\nand is capable\nof doing all kinds\nof wonderful things\nback in the 80s kids\nhad to learn\nhow to code computer too.\nYou use them and as\na result these kids grew up\nwith an inbuilt understanding\nof how computers work.\nNow, we need more programmers\nthan ever before so to deal\nwith this problem.\nSome clever people came up\nwith the Raspberry Pi\nto reignite the spark.\nIt runs minutes\na free operating system\nfrom an SD card just like\nthe one in your digital camera\nand it's powered by\nUSB phone charger.\nYou just plug in a mouse\nand the keyboard.\nTo a TV or Monitor\nand you're ready\nto go in schools.\nNot only is best berry pie\na great way to learn programming\nskills as part of ICT.\nThere are also dozens\nof cross-curricular applications\nnext science and music\nand all over the world.\nPeople are experimenting\nwith Raspberry Pi's and\nattending raspberry jam events\nwhere people of\nall ages are learning\nwhat can be done\nwith a Raspberry Pi\nsince the first\nRaspberry Pi was ship.\nWe've seen examples of people\nusing the pipe in a variety\nof amazing interesting projects\ntaking advantage of its size\nportability cost programmability\nand connect ability.\nAnd whether you want to learn\nto make games build robot\nor even teach a bath parachute\nwith Raspberry Pi\nthe sky's the limit.\nSo I hope you guys had\na great learning experience\nwith respect to that.\nThat was basically the ideology\nof the Raspberry Pi foundation\non introducing Raspberry Pi\ninto the market\nas well moving on some\nof the capabilities\nthat Raspberry Pi\nenables you to do is\nthat it helps you to browse\nthe internet as well as\nwhat complete HD videos\non the same device as well.\nSo all you need to have\nis a HD supported display\nas such now apart\nfrom that even basic operations\nlike making spreadsheets.\nCreating words presentation\nall these can be done\non Raspberry Pi and you\nhave a huge set of games\nthat are available\nwhich can be played\non Raspberry Pi making\nit quite interesting\nand easy as well for people\nto enjoy the component as well.\nThen you have various\nadd-on capabilities,\nlike infrared cameras\nand security system,\nwhich can be built\nkeeping Raspberry Pi\nas the core Hardware as well.\nThen you can also use\nmany music machines\nas well as detection\nof weather stations,\nwhich we actually had done\nin our previous session.\nOn as well.\nNow.\nThese are just some\nof the top capabilities\nthat I have picked up\nfrom the list Raspberry Pi\ntoday has become one\nof the biggest component\nthat has enabled\nusers to achieve\nand create a lot as well today.\nThe capability of Raspberry Pi\nis restricted just\nto your imagination whatever you\ncan imagine can be done using\nRaspberry Pi given the amount\nof effort put into that.\nMmm now moving on let's look\nThe Raspberry Pi Hardware\nas well before that.\nLet me show you\nhow I would be using\na Raspberry Pi as part\nof this tutorial session.\nSo let me just give\nyou a simple overview\nof the component as such now\nwhat you basically see is\nthat the Raspberry Pi Hardware.\nSo let me just switch\nover the camera and let me show\nyou the Raspberry Pi now here\nwhat you're seeing is the\nRaspberry Pi 3 Hardware as such\nand this is your processor\nand system on chip,\nwhich is an adrenal\na few P3 processor.\nNow two important ports\nhere is the CSI.\nWhich is the\ncamera serial interface\nwhere you can connect camera\ndirectly to the Raspberry Pi\nand the DSi Port which is\nthe display serial input Port.\nOkay.\nNow, let me just flip\nthis over slightly.\nAnd if you see this\nis a 2.5 M. M--\nmicro USB connector.\nSo your standard mobile charger\ncan be used to charge\nthe Raspberry Pi\nand this is a standard\nHDMI port for display.\nSo your standard\nTVs and monitors\nwhich have an HDMI support\ncan be used to become\na video interface for that.\nThen you have an audio jack,\nwhich is used to connect\nyour audio input now,\nlet me just flip the slightly\nover and let me zoom out a bit.\nNow if you see we have\nan Ethernet connector\nfollowing which there are\nfour USB slots as well.\nSo when you see here,\nthere's a 40 pin General\ninput output pin present here.\nSo this is something\nthat's quite interesting\nand configurable from\nyour Raspberry Pi a software\nwhere you can configure for what\neach purpose pins can be used\nwhich will be silly little head.\nNow the final thing that I\nwant to show you is behind here\nwhen you flip backside,\nso there is a micro\nUSB slot present here.\nThis is mainly to insert\nyour memory card.\nAnd when I say memory card,\nI would generally recommend\nat least a 16 GB memory card.\nThis is mainly\nbecause the Operating system\nand itself is about 4 GB\nand if you use an AGP,\nthen what happens is there is\nvery Less storage space\nfor your operating system\nto work on as well.\nSo 16 GB memory card\nwould be really helpful.\nAnd one thing\nthat you want to see is\nthis is an Evo class,\nwhich is something similar\nto a class 10 memory card.\nSo if you get a memory card,\nmake sure it's at least a Class\nA Door class 10 memory card\nso that you can have\nhigh disk read\nand write processing\nnow coming back.\nNow bow your head let's just\nskim through the various changes\nthat has happened\nover the hardware\nof Raspberry Pi now.\nWe are not going to devote\ntoo much time into this\nbecause this is a completely\nin detail session\nhow I would be stopping\nat these slides for 10 seconds.\nSo if you wish to know more\nyou can pause the video and get\na complete look as well.\ntalking about the processor\nthe first generation\nof Raspberry Pi initially\ncame with a broad\nCamby CM 2 8 3 5 SOC\nand it basically\nwas similar to the first\ngeneration smartphone chips\nand the architecture\nthat was used also was\nan armv6 architecture now\nthe over the years\nRaspberry Pi 3 has grown a lot\nand today it has a capability\nof 1.2 gigahertz\nwhich basically is\nbecause of the a arm cortex a53\n64-bit processor it is\nconsidered to be 10 times faster\nin comparison to Raspberry Pi\nwow now I'm talking\nabout the change\nin raspberry pi over the years\nas you can see here the various\nmodels have been listed\nand the architecture change\nhas also been mentioned\nhere as well so in case\nif you are interested in Rome\nor you can pause the video\nand take a look at this now\nwhen you come to the memory\nthe first model of Raspberry Pi\ncame with a 256 MB RAM\nand which basically\nwere shared by the GPU\nbut today with Raspberry\nPi Version 2 and 3\nyou have four times\nthat you have about 1GB of ram\nwhich again is shared\nby the GPU as well.\nNow the default split was\nat hundred and ninety-two MB RAM\nfor the CPU basically,\nwhich was more than\nenough to play a full HD\nthat is 1080p video\nor perform simple 3D operations,\nbut again, not too\ncomplicated operations as well.\nNow moving forward\nwhen you look at the networking\ncapabilities in terms\nof networking capabilities,\nthe Model A of Raspberry Pi\ndid not have any such features,\nbut from model B\nof version 1 itself,\nyou had an ethernet port\nwhich was introduced here\nand from version 3.\nYou also have Wi-Fi\nand Bluetooth capabilities\nintroduced here as well.\nNow talking about\nthe peripherals in Raspberry Pi\nthere are basically\nfour USB ports.\nNow, this has been introduced in\nmodel B version 1 plus onwards\nand today you have a lot more\nthat you can do with respect to\nthat even audio input ports\nand audio output ports\nhave not Over the years\nbut the on-board storage\nhas changed a lot\nwith respect director.\nNow again,\nwhen you look at the video\ncapabilities video controllers,\nbasically here you\ncan watch complete HD videos\nbut Raspberry Pi does not have\na hatch 256 decoding Harbor\nbut the CPU in itself is\nway more capable\nand helps you in decoding\nthe h26 included videos\nthrough software operations now\nin terms of GPU the GPU\nin Raspberry Pi 3 runs\nat a higher clock frequency,\nwhich is about 300\nor 400 in comparison\nto the previous versions\nwhich is at about\n250 six megahertz.\nNow in terms of video input\nyou have a 15 put CSI connector\nthat has always been present\nwith the Raspberry Pi\nand we output has changed\nover the years.\nYou have a HDMI port\nyou have a DSi port\nand now you also have\na 3.5 mmm trrs Jack as well.\nNow in terms\nof the connector capabilities.\nThere are 17 pins\nof the gpio port switch\ncan be configured as\nper your requirements as well.\nNo, moving forward.\nThese are the various\ndetails with respect\nto the general input output pin.\nThis data has been\ntaken from Wikipedia.\nSo in case if you're looking\nfor more information,\nyou can definitely\ncheck out wiki space\nor the official Raspberry\nPi documentation as\nwell now coming down.\nLet's begin the Raspberry Pi\ninstallation process here.\nBut first,\nlet me help you understand\nthe different operating systems\nthat are available at present.\nOkay Raspberry Pi\nin itself supports.\nHas multiple operating systems\nas such but we will mainly\nbe working on raspbian.\nOkay.\nSo these are some of the most\npopular operating systems\nsupported on Raspberry Pi\nso you have risc OS you have\nFreeBSD operating system.\nYou have net BSD operating\nsystem Plan 9 is again\nfrom Bell Labs as well as\nWindows has its own Windows\n10 of iot version.\nOkay.\nSo for this session,\nwe're not going to go\ninto the Windows 10 will stick\nto the core Raspberry\nPi operating system\nnow for downloading\nthe operating system.\nYou can go on\nto the original site.\nThat is Raspberry Pi Dot o-- r--\ng--\nAnd there in the downloads tab,\nyou can download\nthe operating system.\nLet me just show it to you.\nOkay.\nSo this is the Raspberry Pi\nhome page and here if you go on\nto the download section,\nyou can download\nthe operating system.\nNow if you are starting off\nwith Raspberry Pi an Internet\nof Things trust me.\nThis is the best place\nthat you can find\na lot of informations\nwith respect to it.\nOkay, most people actually\npublished their details\nwith respect to the projects\nthat they're working\nmany popular projects\nare also available.\nYou can find a lot of help as\nwell as good information here.\nOkay.\nSo this is definitely\nthe place to go to if you go on\nto the download section\nhere, okay this\nI'll show you 2 options you\nhave nodes or you have raspbian.\nI would recommend\nthat you go with notes\nbecause this is a complete\npackage with respect\nto the different operating\nsystems as such so here again,\nyou have noobs and Loops like so\nmy recommendation would be\nyou download notes\nand make sure you using\na 32 GB memory card with this\nwould be really helpful\nbecause it gives a lot of memory\nfor your operating system.\nSo in case if you're going\nfor a 16gb or below I\nwould recommend you go\nwith the nope slide,\nbut make sure you keep the bare\nminimum of 16 GB in case\nif you working with Raspberry Pi\nbut do not mistake me.\nWhen I say use\na 16 GB memory card.\nYou can install it\non an 8GB as well.\nBut again, the operating system\nhas less memory to work.\nSo at least go\nfor 16 or higher 32 is\nwhat I would recommend.\nSo once you download\nthis ZIP file,\nor you can even download\nit by a torrent.\nOkay, but I would recommend\ndownload it as a zip file.\nLet me show you the file.\nSo this is the noobs file.\nLet me extract this.\nOkay, it may take some time.\nIt's about a 1.5 GB file.\nOkay, the lights were seen as\nslightly lower in comparison,\nbut this is something\nthat I would recommend in case\nif you're working\nwith Raspberry Pi.\nOkay, so I have\nmy noobs folder here.\nSo what you need to do is\nthat you need to copy everything\ninside the nude photos\nand then paste it\ninside the SD card.\nOkay, make sure you are\nnot directly copy\npasting the folder\nthat you have extract.\nSo what happens is\nif you do that,\nit does not actually recognize\nthe operating system as part\nof the Raspberry Pi\nso copy everything\nthat you've extracted\nand then directly paste it\ninside the SD card.\nNow again, this\nis why I recommend\nthat you use a high\nspeed memory card\nbecause in case\nif you are not using it then\nwhat happens is\nBut it takes a lot\nof time with respect\nto fetching the data.\nOkay.\nNow as I had mentioned\nif you're going\nfor a memory card\nfor your Raspberry Pi\nyou can use something\nlike a 16gb at least\nand make sure it has\na high transfer speed.\nSo this in turn will give you\na lot of memory area to work\naround with as well.\nAs I would recommend\nyou take something\nlike a class 10 memory card\nthat is available\nin the market today.\nSo these have a very good read\nand write speed ratio.\nSo definitely this is something\nthat you should consider\nwhile you're getting a memory\ncard for your operating system.\nOkay now Once you're done\ncopying with this,\nlet's go on to install\nthis memory card\nonto a Raspberry Pi and let's\nbegin the installation process.\nOkay, so now we've\nsuccessfully copied all\nthat is needed\nfor our operating system.\nSo safely remove this make\nsure you rejecting it safely\nbecause sometimes\nwhat happens is\nif you do not see\nif rejected the\nfiles get corrupted\nbefore you load it\ninto your Raspberry Pi this\nis certain issue with respect\nto the memory cards.\nSo just eject this.\nOkay.\nSo this is my Raspberry Pi and\nif you actually flip it over.\nThis is the slot where you\nhave to insert the memory card.\nNow, we've copied\nthe noobs folder\ninto this memory card.\nOkay, let me just insert this\ninto this and let's begin\nwith respect to\nthe installation process.\nLet's begin installing\nthis memory card\nonto my Raspberry Pi\nand start with the setup.\nSo, let me just turn the\non my Raspberry Pi.\nOkay, so this is a screen.\nI'm getting by default.\nNow what happens is the\ninstallation steps initializes.\nSo the Raspberry Pi\nis getting loaded.\nNow there are\ntwo operating systems\nthat are present here by default\nand we want raspbian.\nSo let me just select\nraspbian and click\non install option present here.\nIf you see here it\nbasically is telling me\nthat it requires 4.5 GPA.\nSo this is why I\nwas recommending you\nto get at least 16 GB\nor more because\nif I have an 8 GB memory card\nif 4.5 GB goes off with\nthe operating system itself,\nthen there's not\nmuch memory left\nfor me to work around with now.\nLet me just click on install.\nJust before I do that in case\nif you are using\na different language,\nor if you want to use\na different keyboard as well,\nyou make sure you're\nspecifying that okay.\nSo there are written language\nis present here.\nSo choose the\ncorresponding language as\nper your requirement.\nOnce you selected\nthat description install\nand this is just\nbasically going to ask you\nwhether you want\nto format your data\nand install the operating system\non top of this.\nSo click on yes,\nand the installation process has\nbegun now it may take some time.\nSo I request you\nto be a bit patient\nbecause this is an Operating\nsystem installation process,\nso please be a bit patient\nand hope you have fun mean wire.\nSo now as you can see the\noperating system installation\nhas completed successfully\nonce you hit on okay,\nit's going to ask me\nwhether I want to reboot or it\nautomatically reboot as well.\nOkay.\nSo yeah, it's automatically\nrebooting at this point.\nOkay.\nNow as you can see the Raspberry\nPi operating system\nhas successfully been installed.\nOkay.\nSo this is what your Raspberry\nPi operating system\nwould be looking like okay.\nSo this is raspbian\nas such so there are\ndifferent operating systems\nthat are available today\nfor you to install that we\nhave discussed already now\nthat we've installed\nraspbian on our system.\nLet's look at some\nof the accessories\nwhich can be used\nwith Raspberry Pi now one\nof the most popular\nand interesting accessory to\nRaspberry Pi is the sense hat.\nOkay, so that basically is\na hardware attached on top.\nThere are various hearts\nthat are available\nbut censored is the most popular\nbecause you have various\nonboard sensors present here.\nYou have a temperature humidity\nand pressure sensor present here\nas well as a gyroscope\nand a joystick also present\nhere apart from this.\nThe reason that it\nis quite popular is\nbecause it has an 8 cross\n8 LED Matrix display\nthat is present to him.\nSo let me just switch over\nand show you the sense\nhat component as well.\nAnd okay.\nSo here you can see\nthe sensor know how it is\nslightly different from\nthe the other accessories is\nbecause it's got an 8 cross\nAid LED Matrix present here,\nwhich can be used\nfor displaying various things\nand we will also be seeing\nhow you can display this\nas well now coming on\nto the other components here.\nNow if you see here,\nit's already got\nmultiple sensors here.\nIt's got an accelerometer\nand the gyroscope\nmeter present here.\nIt's also got we just\nthis part the axe low\nand gyrometer present here.\nSo you can see it's got\nlabeling as well.\nThen you have\na humidity pressure\nand temperature sensor\non board with respect to this\nand it's quite interesting\nand useful as well.\nNow one of the easiest things\nwith respect to this is\nthat it can directly\nbe placed on top\nof the Raspberry Pi's gpio pins\nand thereby making it quite easy\nto assemble it as well.\nSo it directly sits on top\nof the gpio pins as well.\nSo this is something\nwhich makes the entire Raspberry\nPi ecosystem quite easy\nand effective one other\ninteresting key point or factor\nthat makes the sensor\nquite interesting is\nthat it's gotten\non board joystick as well.\nSo in case if you are a gamer\nand you want to try out\nthe games on Raspberry Pi you\ncan use this choice to catch.\nAs such now another additional\ncomponent that most people use\nwith Raspberry Pi is the camera\nnow in 2013 itself one year\nafter Raspberry Pi\n1 was launched.\nIt had introduced\nthe Raspberry Pi camera\nalong with the firmware\nupdate as well.\nNow the r a spy cam is\nbasically an 8 megapixel camera\nand can directly be connected\nto the Cs airport present\non the Raspberry Pi itself.\nNow, it's also very interesting\nand can record up to\nthousand ATP videos as well.\nSo moving forward.\nLet's also look\nat the infrared camera.\nSo this is a very\ninteresting thing.\nSo this was something\nthat helps you capture\nvideo in infrared mode\nand is called pine oil.\nOkay.\nSo again, these components\ncan be bought online\nand is one of the most easily\nby now the final accessori\nannounce the most interesting\nand essential accessory\nto the Raspberry Pi is\nthe Gert board.\nBasically it is used\nfor educational purposes\nand it helps you expand\nthe operations done\nusing the general\ninput output pins here,\nso, Using this you\ncan connect to various LEDs\nwhich is Analog Devices sensors\nand much more.\nThis also helps you connect\nto Audrey know which is also\nanother DYI Hardware device\nwhich has gained a lot\nof popularity but in comparison\nto Raspberry Pi order,\nno is still growing\nStitch moving on.\nLet's begin with\nour sensor tutorial\nand what we'll be doing is\nwe'll be exploring five\ndifferent demos to understand\nhow the sense had component\ncan be used effectively.\nNow the first thing\nthat we'll be doing\nis we'll Implementing\na very simple code\nand we'll be trying\nto display a certain letter\non top of the sensor.\nOkay, so I'm going\nto display p&d but the value\nof that color is going\nto be generated by random.\nOkay, so let me just run\nyou through the code\nthat's present here.\nSo the first line is\nfrom censored import sense.\nSo what it basically is doing is\nthat it's helping\nyou import sense\nat and establish a connection\nto the censored component.\nWe're going to use time\nfor mainly sleeve function.\nOh and random for generating\na random integer.\nNow.\nWhat I'm doing is\nthat I'm initializing\nthe censored which is\nsense equal to sense\nat basically initializes it then\nwhat I'm doing is\nthat I'm generating\na random integer\nbetween the range of 0\nto 255 now for those of you\nwho would have guessed\nwhy I'm doing this.\nDefinitely this is\nbecause the RGB value\nlies in this range,\nso it's somewhere\nbetween 0 to 255 then\nwhat I'm using is that I'm using\na censored function\nwhich is show later\nand then I'm specifying\nwhich It means to show\nand I'm going to specify\nthe color combination.\nSo this is the RGB\nvalues present here.\nOkay, so it's going to show\nthe letter e and it's going\nto create a random input\nwith respect to that same.\nOkay, then it's going to sleep\nfor one second again\ngenerate a new random integer\nand then it is going to show D.\nOkay.\nSo again, it will sleep\nand then it's going to clear.\nSo let me just show you\nthis to you practically.\nSo now what I'm going to do is\nthat I'm going to connect\nto my Raspberry Pi.\nUsing VNC Network.\nSo it's virtual Network,\nwhich I'm connecting it to\nbecause it's not quite easy\nfor me to record the video\non the Raspberry Pi so I'm going\nto use VNC server for that\nand I'll just give you\na simple idea of how you\ncan connect to VNC server\nto your Raspberry Pi as well.\nNow one essential thing\nthat if you are connecting\nto the VNC server,\nthen you both need to be\non the same network.\nOkay.\nSo what I've done is\nI have used a hotspot\nconnected both my Raspberry Pi\nand my laptop to the Network\nso in case you are wondering\nhow to connect to your Raspberry\nPi y remote server,\nthis is how you do it.\nJust go to your settings\ngo to preferences.\nYou have Raspberry\nPi configuration here.\nNow in your interfaces make sure\nthat VNC is enable.\nOnce you've done this then\nVNC server gets enabled\nand onto your system\njust download VNC server\nand VNC viewer and\nyou can connect\nyour Raspberry Pi quite easily.\nOkay.\nSo let me just show you the code\nwhich we're going\nto be executing now,\nit's the same that we\nhave seen earlier.\nSo, let me just make\na small modification to this.\nSo this is awkward again\nas we have seen we are first\ninitializing the censored\nwith sense equal to censored\nthen we're generating\na random integer\nand then we showing a letter\ne on that so let me\njust change this.\nLet me just set it to 0 and let\nme just copy this once more\nand I'll also show a third\ncombination here as well.\nSo I'm just generating\na random value between 0 to 255\nand I'm displaying\nbased on that color.\nLetter e d and f okay,\nso let me just save this once\nso let me show you the output\nthat is going to be\ndisplayed on the sense\nthat as well.\nSo so let me just\nexecute the program.\nOkay.\nNow let me just switch\nover to the censored\nso that you can see the output.\nIt's a ready green d\nand a blue f as well.\nSo this is what So based\non the inputs that I\nhave given it has displayed\na certain letter on the censored\nLED display as well.\nSo let's go back\nto our presentation\nand look at the next program\nthat is involved here.\nSo the next program basically\nis going to display an image.\nNow what it does here is\nthat it basically is going\nto display an image\nthat Gives you a complete idea\nof the various color\ncombinations possible\non the sense at as well.\nSo what I have basically done is\nthat I have identified\nthe RGB colors red orange\nyellow green blue indigo violet\nand E stands for empty,\nwhich is null.\nOkay and based on this.\nI've created a\nrandom Matrix here,\nbut each of these values defines\nfor a pixel of the sensor now\nas I have mentioned\nto you earlier,\nthis is an Eight cross\nit led Matrix.\nSo each of these values\nis for one of the\nindividual pixels themself\nand with respect to how they\nstart the numbering starts\nfrom left top position.\nSo accordingly it goes\nin a row by row, man.\nOkay, so let me just show you\nthe output for this as well.\nSo this is our program\nand let me execute this\nand show it to you.\nAnd now let me just switch over\nto the Raspberry Pi.\nTo here you can see\nthe different color combinations\nthat are present\non the Raspberry Pi sensor.\nThe first row was\nleft completely empty.\nThe next row has\nto our values present here.\nSo this is how it\nhas been defined.\nIf you notice the code here,\nthere are two are following\nby three empty spaces.\nAnd before that.\nAlso, if you can consider\nthree empty spaces\nthat is one rule.\nSo every specific\nvalue is pertaining\nto one specific row as such now\ncoming back to our presentation.\nAnd so the third one\nis quite interesting.\nWhat we're basically\ngoing to do here is\nthat we're going to rotate\na letter based on the different\norientation of the screen.\nSo let me show you\nhow this is done rather\nthan just tell it to you.\nSo what we basically\ngoing to do here is\nthat we're going\nto rotate a letter\nJ on different angles as well.\nSo we've defined\nthe different angle 0\n90 180 270 and these\nare the various angles\nwhich is going to rotate for.\nOkay.\nI'm going to run a for Loop\nwhere it rotates\nthe same on different.\nAngles as well.\nSo let me just show you\nthat so just let me add\nsince dot here here.\nNow.\nThe reason I'm doing\nthat is mainly to ensure\nthat the sense that is cleared\nafter the rotation process.\nSo let's execute this.\nLet me switch over\nto the Raspberry Pi\nand if you see here\nA Jay has been displayed\nand it's rotating.\nOkay, it has stopped.\nSo let me just rerun\nthis once again.\nSo what is happening here is\nthat I'm rotating\nthe letter J by 90 degrees\nand it's completing to complete\ncircles on the Raspberry Pi.\nOkay, so it's a very\nsimple thing but it's important\nthat you understand\nhow this is done\nbecause what we're\nbasically doing is\nthat we are setting\nthe rotation using the sensor.\nOkay, and then we're sleeping\nat point zero five\nmilliseconds as well.\nAgain, you can increase\nthe delay here.\nYou can change the letter here.\nYou can even change\nthe angle to understand\nhow it works as well.\nSo this is something that you\nshould definitely explore\nabout and get a better\nunderstanding with coming down\nthe next and most basic thing\nthat you can do.\nUsing sensor is that you\ncan measure the temperature\npressure and humidity.\nSo we've already\ntried to do this\nin our previous session as well\nwhere we've measured\nthe temperature the pressure\nand the humidity now here\nI'm just rounding it off\nand based on a specific value.\nI'm going to ensure\nwhether the display\nis going to be red\nor green as well.\nSo let me come back to my senses\nat let me just open the code\nand we will modify this\non the go to get\na better understanding.\nLet me explain.\nIn the code once again,\nso first I'm establishing\na connection to the censored\nthen I'm running\nan infinite Loop\nwhere I'm getting\nthe temperature the\npressure the humidity.\nI'm rounding it off and\nif the temperature is about 36,\nso this is just a value\nthat I have set then\nthe background color\nshould be green\nand the color of the text\nshould be complete wide.\nOkay.\nSo this is a simple modification\nI have made else\nin normal situation\nif it is less than 36 degrees\nthen what it should be.\nIs that it should have\na background color of blue\nand the text color\nshould be yellow.\nSo this is basically to help me\nidentify the different ranges.\nThen I am creating\na message variable\nwhich is storing\nthe following format\nwhere temperature is equal\nto temperature value pressure\nis equal to pressure value\nand humidity is equal\nto the humidity values.\nFinally.\nI'm going to show\nthis message on my sense\nat LED display screen.\nSo let's just see how this works\nand execute the program.\nSo let me just execute\nthe program and let\nme also switch over\nto the Raspberry Pi.\nSo here let's begin\nwith the execution of the code.\nSo now you can see by default.\nIt is having a blue background\nand the text is\nactually in yellow.\nOkay, so if you would have\nnoticed the temperature is\nabout 34 degrees Centigrade.\nSo to this letter\nor Scroll once more\nlet's just validate\nthe value of temperature.\nYou can also print\nthis into the screen.\nYou can also send it\nvia an API and much more.\nSo if you can see,\nit's thirty four point\ntwo degree Centigrade now\nto this what I'm going\nto do basically is\nthat I'm just going\nto introduce a hot water source.\nOkay, so I'm just trying\nto raise the temperature here.\nSo let me just shift\na little bit\nand please keep a note\non the temperature value.\nSo the temperature\nhas started Rising.\nSo it is taking some time.\nI think the water\nhas cooled down a bit.\nAll right, so it's started\nnow the color background color\nhas changed from blue to green\nand the text color has changed\nfrom yellow to white as one now.\nThese can be used in critical\nmeasure environments as well.\nSo let's say you are\nin a situation or an environment\nwhere you need to have\na constant Monitor\nand constantly be aware\nwith respect to the environment\nchange in example,\nlike space or\nany other environment\nthat you're working with.\nDefinitely.\nThese are certain things\nthat can really be important\nand helpful as well.\nSo Coming back.\nLets us.\nLook at the last program\nof the sensors tutorial,\nwhich is basically detecting\nthe motion of the sense\nthat now what I'm basically\ngoing to do here is\nthat I am going to rotate\nmy science at and I'm going\nto identify the value of\npitch roll and yaw on basically,\nthese are the orientation\nwith respect to the x\naxis y axis and Z axis\nand this is just from\nthe orientation of the sense\nthat as well.\nNow this is mainly done\nusing the gyroscope\nbut to get a better\nunderstanding and more precise.\nValue will also try\nto include and incorporate\nthe accelerometer as well.\nSo let me come here.\nLet me just show\nyou the program.\nSo this is the program as well.\nSo let me just stop\nthe execution here.\nSo as I had mentioned\nthis is going to run\ninfinite number of times\nbecause the while statement\nhere is indefinite.\nSo let me just stop\nthis and let me just run\nthe orientation program\nand Let's just see\nthe default values\nof pitch yarn and roll first.\nSo now by default\nif you see pictures\nabout zero role is about\n96 and Ian is about 0 itself.\nNow, let me just switch\nover to the sense\nat and what I'm going\nto do parallely is\nthat let me try radiating\nthe value of the sensor as well\nor let me try rotating\nthe sensor to give you\na better understanding of\nhow it works simultaneously.\nYou can also see the change\nin Pitch Ian and road.\nSo if you see Here\nI'm slightly lifting it\nand the value of which\nhas risen from zero\nto six role also has changed\nIan also has changed.\nI'm going to try tilting\nit same pitch roll and yaw\non also has changed.\nSo I'm just filling it\nwith respect to various accesses\nand you can see the change here.\nYou notice the changes I\ndefinitely hope you do.\nOkay.\nSo now let us actually stop\nthe execution of this program\nbecause this is also\nan infinite Loop\nand to same orientation program.\nLet us actually\ntry to incorporate\nthe accelerometer and understand\nhow more precise we\ncan make now instead of just\ntaking the pitch roll and yaw\non I'm here going\nto directly take the value\nof acceleration here.\nWe have taken the value\nof orientation and here\nwe're going to take\nthe Of Aksum duration,\nokay how basically\nthe first is with respect\nto the gravitational force\nthat acts on this.\nSo now let me just show\nyou the code here.\nNow again, what you need\nto understand the difference\nbetween gyro measure\nand Axle row measure is just\nthat its senses\nboth the static as\nwell as Dynamic change\nwith respect to that\nbut your gyroscope\nmany measures the rotation\nof a specific device as such.\nOkay, so let me just execute\nthis program as well.\nso let me just first begin\nby clearing the screen\nand then we'll execute\nthe code once again,\nso let's just execute\nthe acceleration code to get\na better understanding\nand simultaneously\nwhat I'll do is\nthat I'll just show you\nhow the change with respect\nto the axis is or how you\nif you change the Raspberry Pi\nhow the value will also\nchange so by default\nif you can see\nthe value of x is 0\nthe value of y is also 0\nand Z is 1 so now\nwhat To do is\nthat let me Begin by slightly\nrotating the Raspberry Pi now\nif I change the Raspberry Pi\ninto a vertical\nposition like this.\nOkay, so it's a perfectly\nvertical position.\nBut if you notice the value\nof x it is become minus 1,\nokay, why has become 0\nand Z has become 0 same time.\nIf I rotate it in such a manner.\nI'm just keeping it\non different axis the value of x\nbecomes plus 1 instead of\nminus 1 same with respect to Y\nif I change it in such\na horizontal way it\nis minus 1 and if I change it\nin such a manner then\nit becomes plus one.\nOkay.\nIf you flip it completely\nover then the value\nof Z becomes minus one as well.\nSo if this is the vertical\nposition then the value\nof Z remains one,\nI hope this is clear\nfor you guys.\nSo again, these are\nall different parameters today\nwhat I have done\nas part of this is\nthat I've just\nhelp you understand\nhow you can explore\nthe various parameters\nand various components\nthat are associated\nto the Raspberry Pi\ncensored as well.\nNow what how you use it\nand what you use it\nfor is completely left\nyou these are just some\nof the basic things\nthat you can do\nusing Raspberry Pi\nthe limitation of\nRaspberry Pi stops\nwhere your imagination stops.\nOkay, now that we've installed\nraspbian on Raspberry Pi it's\ntime we begin with the demo\nfor this session.\nNow, what we're trying to do is\nthat we're trying to build\na weather detection system\nto get the real\ntime weather analysis\nwhen we talked\nwith real term analysis.\nIt basically is the pressure\ntemperature and humidity.\nAnd what we want to do is\nthat we want to get a live\nmobile notification for this.\nSo for that will be first\nusing censored board\nwhich will help us measure\nthe various metrics\nlike temperature humidity\nand pressure.\nIran to a Raspberry Pi then\nwe'll use Raspberry Pi\nto transfer this data\nand display it on the sense\nthat as well.\nSo we'll just be displaying\nthe temperature as\nof now on the set.\nAnd finally we'll be\nusing insta push API\nand Python program through which\nwe can send this notification\nacross the Internet\nto our mobile application.\nSo let's begin\nthis demo part first.\nLet me show you\nwhat's and satis\nand how you can assemble sense\nat on Raspberry Pi.\nOkay.\nSo this is my Raspberry Pi unit\nand this is That's what\nI was referring to.\nThis is sunset boat.\nOkay.\nNow if you see this is\na simple additional board\nthat you can add on top\nof your Raspberry Pi.\nOkay.\nNow it's quite simple,\nbut how it's different is\nthat in comparison\nto your Raspberry Pi\nthere is a neat cross 8 digital\nLED display present here.\nSo you can use this\nfor various different purposes\nas per your requirement.\nOkay.\nNow, it's simply sits\non top of the Raspberry Pi.\nOkay, just make sure\nthe alignment is correct.\nAnd once you've done\nwith that just push it on top.\nAnd the pins would\nmerge accordingly.\nOnce you do that you\ncan just place the four screws\nacross the different ends\nand tighten it up.\nAnd once you're done with this,\nyou can integrate\nand use the censored\nfor various different purposes.\nWe will use sensor to measure\nthe temperature the pressure as\nwell as the humidity\nacross in this room\nthat is present.\nOkay, so this has\ndifferent sensors present on it\nand we'll be using them\nfor today's demo.\nOkay.\nSo let me just put this up\nand once it's all set up.\nLet's go back\nto our demo and let's begin\nwith understanding the programs\nbefore we begin the execution.\nOkay.\nSo moving on now\nthat you've understood\nabout Raspberry Pi's\nand Saturn V.\nWe also install\nraspbian on our Bye,\nlet's move forward\nand start with respect\nto today's demo part.\nSo again going back\njust to remind you.\nWe trying to create\na better control system\nwherein we try to measure\nthe temperature the pressure\nand the humidity\naround the sensor as such.\nOkay.\nSo the first thing we're going\nto do is I let me just connect\nto my Raspberry Pi.\nOkay.\nSo this is\nmy Raspberry Pi interface.\nNow.\nLet me just show you\nthe program as well.\nSo I've divided the actual\nprogram into three parts\nso that it's easier\nfor you to understand\nhow this program\nworks as such now,\nthe first program\nthat we are going to execute\nis the sensing environment.\nSo this is a simple program\nthat's going to sense\nthe environment variables.\nThat is the temperature\npressure and humidity.\nAnd then it's going\nto correspondingly display\nthese values on the censored\nLED display panel.\nNow, let me explain this program\nto you one by one now firstly we\nneed to import the He boosts\nthe values on the censored.\nSo for that we're going\nto use this line from sense\nunderscore hat import sense\nat so this will give me\nthe corresponding values\nfrom the sensor\nto my Raspberry Pi interface.\nThen I'm also importing type.\nNow.\nThe main objective\nof time is to help me keep\na log of all the values\nthat are measuring.\nOkay, so that will be\nseeing little ahead.\nAfter that.\nI'm going to assign\nthe censored values\nto a variable known as sense.\nOkay, so through this variable.\nI'm going to correspondingly\nrelate to all the values coming.\nFrom the sense at okay\nmoving forward we\nhave written a while loop\nand this is an infinite\nwhile it's going to continuously\nmeasure the temperature\npressure and humidity\nand is going to correspondingly\nbe displayed on the sense\nthat as well.\nOkay.\nSo let me help you understand\nhow the temperature humidity\nand pressure are measured.\nOkay.\nSo what you need to do\nto measure the temperature\nis used the function sense dot\nget underscore temperature.\nSo this function\nthat is get underscore\ntemperature will give me\nthe temperature value\nmeasured by the sensor\nin degree centigrade.\nIt and hear what I'm\nbasically doing is\nthat I'm just converting\nit into fahrenheit.\nOkay, so the value\nin degree Centigrade into\n1 Point 8 plus 32 is just\na Fahrenheit representation\nof the current temperature.\nI'm using a round\nfunction to round\nof the corresponding value.\nI don't need any decimal\npoint values here.\nI want a whole number.\nSo what I'm doing is\nthat I'm using a round function\nand once I have the temperature\nthen I'm going to be storing it\ninside a temp variable.\nOkay.\nSimilarly.\nWe are going to use\nsense not get humidity\nand sense dot get\npressure to get both.\nThe humidity as well as pressure\nand store it in humidity\nand pressure variables are such.\nSo basically I have\nall my three variables\nthat are needed now.\nWhat I'll do is I'll create\na string called message.\nOkay into which I'm going to\nstore the temperature humidity\nand pressure with\na specific notation.\nSo T is going to be equal\nto the temperature H is going\nto be equal to the humidity\nand P is going to be equal\nto the pressure.\nNow comes the part\nwhere have to display this value\nonto my sensor display screen.\nOkay, so here I'm going\nto use the function.\nSense dot show\nunderscore message.\nSo this is basically\na call through which\nI can send any message to\nmy sensor display screen.\nOkay.\nNow here I am just passing\nthe message with respect\nto the temperature humidity\nand pressure variable\nand then I'm also\ndefining a scroll speed.\nNow.\nThis is something that\nyou can play around with\nif you want to have\na fastest-growing you\ncan modify it.\nI have chosen a 0.08 scroll\nspeed then the other two factors\nare the font color\nand the background color.\nOkay.\nAnother text color I\nhave set as 200 240.\nTea and 200 now\nif you can guess these are\nbasically the RGB values for\nthe corresponding text color.\nSo this is something\nthat I have said as\nper my requirement you\ncan play around as well\nas background color is something\nthat I have set to 0 0 and 0.\nOkay.\nSo you have complete freedom\nto modify this as\nper your interest.\nI would definitely recommend\nthat you try playing around\nwith this to get a better feel\nof how it works.\nOkay.\nNow what I'm doing is\nthat I'm putting my system\nto sleep for four seconds.\nThis is basically to introduce\na delay between the\nmeasurement carried out.\nOn the sensor now,\nif I don't do this\nsince it's a continuously\nrunning infinite loop\nit's going to keep measuring\nat one after the other.\nSo I want a simple delay\nbetween the measurement.\nSo I'm putting the system\nto sleep for four seconds.\nAfter that.\nWhat I'm doing is\nthat I'm opening a file\ncalled weather dot txt now here.\nI am going to create\nthe log into this file.\nI'll take the present time and\nthen pass the message as well.\nSo these both with respect\nto the present time as\nwell as the message are going\nto be stored in form of a law.\nOkay, so in case in future\nif I want Want to refer\nto the measurement,\nthis is something\nthat will be really helpful.\nFinally.\nI'm also going to print\nmessage on my console.\nNow.\nThis is something just\nfor our understanding as well.\nWe'll be seeing it\non different places will see it\non the console will see it\non the sensor as well as we\nwill be seeing it\ninside the log file as well.\nFinally.\nI'm closing the log\nand then I'm putting my system\nto sleep for 5 seconds.\nSo these sleep delays\nare just to ensure\nthat the consistent values\nare being measured\nin regular interval\nand there is no hindrance\nwith respect to Okay.\nI hope you guys\nare clear with this\nbecause I'm going to go on\nto execute this program.\nSo let me open my console.\nOkay here let me write\nthe command for executing\na Python program\nand it's very simple.\nIt's just python followed\nby the filename.\nOkay.\nNow in our case\nit's sensing environment.\nOkay, so let me execute this.\nAnd now if you see\nthe values are being computed\nand on the sense\nthat the values are being shown\nas well so you can see here\nthe change with respect to that.\nOkay, firstly it showed me\nall the temperature humidity\nand pressure and now\nit's already come\non the console as well.\nSimilarly the going to have\na simple delay and then you\ncan Already it showing me\nthe next values on my sensor\nand it's going to be\nstored in a log file.\nAnd then it's going\nto come onto my console.\nSo very interesting.\nRight?\nSo definitely you can play\naround with respect to the font.\nYou can play around with respect\nto the background color as well\nas if you are interested,\nyou can try bringing\ndifferent temperature items\nnear the sensor to see\nthe variation with respect\nto that as well.\nLet's say if you have\na glass of hot water\nand you bring it near the sensor\nthe temperature value will\ncorrespondingly change as well.\nOkay.\nSo this is something that\nyou can really Experiment on\nand have a good understanding\nof how things work.\nSo let me just close\nthis program and let's\nsee the log file.\nOkay.\nSo this is my weather\ndot txt file.\nSo I have taken different\ntemperature measure variables.\nIt's been log from a long time\nthat we've been\ntrying this out on.\nSo definitely there are\na lot of values here.\nOkay.\nSo let me just show\nyou the latest value.\nSo this is a range of values\nthat I had just tried\nout some time back.\nSo all the log\nall the temperature\nand pressure log are being\nstored here continuously.\nOkay when you feel comfortable.\nThis is the latest log\nthat we have just created with\nrespect to the three values.\nThis is the current\nstatus as such.\nOkay.\nSo again, this is something\nthat you can experiment on.\nI am just told it because of\nmy future reference as well.\nOkay.\nSo I hope you guys have got\na simple understanding of\nhow you can connect\nto your sense at measure\nthe temperature pressure\nand humidity and also display it\non the console as\nwell as on your sex act.\nNow coming on\nto the second part second part\nis the slightly Advanced version\nof the same program here.\nWe're trying to do something\na little more apart from just\nseeing it on the screen.\nOkay.\nNow I want to send an email\nwith respect to all the logs\nthat I have or let us say\nat a regular interval.\nI want to have an email\nwhich notifies me with respect\nto the present temperature\nand the current\npressure and humidity.\nNow, this is something\nthat you can definitely use\nwhile you're working\non a social experiment\nas such usually\nin the Laboratories.\nIt's important that you\nalways keep Check\non the temperature\npressure and humidity.\nSo this is something\nthat you can try out.\nSo let me show you the code.\nAlright, so here I am just\nincluding something new as well\napart from our previous code.\nOkay.\nNow if you see our previous code\nis still present here.\nI'm taking the temperature.\nI'm taking the pressure humidity\nstoring into a message\nand then I'm also\nprinting that message\nbut apart from that\nI'm using a few libraries\nwhich are very essential\nfor mailing me this detail.\nOkay.\nSo for that,\nI'm going to use\nfirst SMTP Library.\nOkay, because your I'm\nwailing Protocols are\nSMTP based protocols.\nSo these are something\nthat I will be using\nin case I need to send a mail\nwith respect to all the details\nas such so these\nare standard protocols\nthrough which I be communicated.\nOkay.\nNow coming down with respect\nto what Mi Ami is\na Miami basically is\nan extension or multi-purpose\ninternet mail extension.\nOkay through which\nI can send emails\nwhich support text characters\nnon text characters audio\nvideo images and so forth.\nSo sending a mail.\nIs an essential important\nLibrary as such?\nOkay moving on forward.\nLet me explain you\nthe code now here we\nare repeating the same thing.\nWe are also importing\nthe time function and then we\nare establishing a communication\nbetween the sense\nat and the program.\nOkay.\nSo here first you need\nto specify the from address\nthat is from Coos mail ID\nyou're sending this.\nSo I have created\nto test Melodies one is\na durocher test 11 at gmail.com.\nSo from this address\nthe mail is going to be sent\nand the address\nwhich is going to be receiving.\nThis is a deal-breaker.\nA Raspberry Pi.\nOkay.\nSo from this email-id\nI'm going to send a log\nwith respect to the data\nthat is measured from I\ncensored Raspberry Pi.\nOkay, then I'm going to use\nmy Mi Ami multi-part\nfunction from here.\nI'm going to distribute my mail\ninto multiple parts.\nSo this is what your Mi\nAmi multi-part function\nwill help you to that.\nSo in my message part the from\nis going to be the from address\nthat is from whom it\nis going the two is going\nto be the to address\nand the subject.\nI am defining it as temperature\nRaspberry Pi so temperature\nThen I'm measuring\nall the temperature as\nwell as the pressure\nand humidity and storing it\ninside a message variable.\nSo here what I'm doing is\nthat I'm basically going\nto attach the message\nin a plane format\nto my message variable,\nwhich is going\nto be the details\nof the temperature and pressure.\nOkay.\nNow, let me come down\nand help you understand\nthis part of the code.\nNow.\nI'm going to establish\na connection to my server.\nSo I'm going to use\nyour server variable\nwhere and I'm establishing\nan SMTP protocol do Google.\nOkay.\nThat is your or\nsmtp.gmail.com sensor.\nThis is a standard\nmail protocol SMTP for Gmail.\nIt is smtp.gmail.com\nother meals you can just replace\nthe corresponding me and then\nyou have the port number.\nSo again with respect to SMTP.\nThis is a standard Port\nthat you would be using\nfor communication.\nThat is 25.\nOkay, then I'm going\nto start my server.\nSo that is server dot start TLS.\nOkay, once I start this\nthen I'm going to specify\nthe login credentials.\nThis is basically\nfor authentication Factor.\nSo server DOT log\nin you have to provide\nthe Username and password.\nSo my from address is\nmy username and my editor\na kpi is the password\nfor this email-id.\nOkay once have specified\nthis then what I'm doing is\nthat I'm converting\nthe message as a string.\nOkay, sometimes what happens is\nwhile you are trying\nto send this.\nIt may not get sent\nas such because it has\nvalues also associated\nwith it some directly converting\nit completely to a string.\nOkay, and then storing it\ninside a variable known as text.\nThen I'm calling\nthe function sin.\nEmail through which I'm\nspecifying from which address\nis going to which address\nit should go and the text\nwhich is part of it.\nFinally.\nI'm quitting the connection\nbetween the server.\nI hope you've understood\ntill here with respect\nto the program now,\nit's time we\nexecute this program.\nOkay, so let me call\npython email dot p y\nokay.\nSo now what it has done now,\nit's connecting to my server.\nThat's the delay here.\nOkay, its measured\nthe temperature its measured\nthe humidity as well as\nmeasured the pressure\nand then it's going\nto send the mail.\nSo let me show you\nthis meal ideas were so\nas you can see here.\nI've already received a mail\nfrom anyway car test lab\nit's called temp rasp\nthat we had set\nand it's given me\nthe corresponding value\nof temperature humidity\nand pressure.\nUh sure so this is what\nI was referring for\nso you can do this across to let\nme show you my sent box as well.\nOkay.\nNow if you see a new Sandbox,\nI can actually see\nthat this male has been said\nso there are two ways\nfor me to verify this as well.\nSo this is something\nthat is really helpful\nfor me now coming back\nto my Raspberry Pi let us\nnow see the final program\nin which we want\nto incorporate this\nand do a little more.\nSo let me explain you the code\nlittle more better here.\nThere are few things do here.\nSo first you have pikul\nand Jason being imported\nnow pikul, basically,\nIs going to help you establish\na connection between your API.\nSo we're going to use an API\nthrough which I'm going\nto pass my data.\nSo for that I'm including\nbikers here apart\nfrom that you have string IO,\nwhich is a standard string\ninput output management package\nand you have\nyour our PI dot gpio.\nSo that is Raspberry Pi's\nGeneral input output.\nI am just referring\nto it as gpio.\nOkay, so moving forward\nwhenever you see gpio it\nis the general input output\nfrom the Raspberry Pi\nand then you have the similar\nfunction you have sense.\nGo hat from censored\nand time function\nand I'm establishing\na connection here\nas we have done earlier\nbetween my sensor\nand my application\nand I am clearing\nthe screen on sensor.\nNow.\nWhat happens is sometimes\nif you've executed\na program before\nand you've stopped the execution\nof the program then\nwhat happens is the display\nwill still have the remaining\ndata present on it.\nIt stays stuck on the sensor.\nSo before we move on\nto with respect to our program,\nwe will clear the data out.\nOkay, so that's what\nsense dot cleared us now here.\nTwo things that are present\nhere hot and cold.\nOkay now why they're\nbeing used I'll come back\nto that a little ahead.\nOkay apart from that.\nThere's also a new variable\nknown as push message.\nSo we'll be talking\nabout this also\nwhen we come down later\nand you'll understand what\nthe push message is used for.\nNow.\nLet's try to understand the code\nwhich will help me\ndisplay numbers on my sensor.\nNow, you might be wondering\nif I have already displayed\nnumber and data on my sensor.\nWhy do I need a separate\npart of the score\nbecause here we're trying\nto do something different.\nAnd from what we\nhave already done,\nso here firstly what we're doing\nis that we're setting an offset\nfrom the left and the top.\nLet me go back\nto my presentation here.\nOkay.\nNow here this is\nthe standard program that\nwe are talking about.\nBut let's see.\nThis is what we need.\nOkay.\nSo this is what we're going\nto explode ahead.\nNow.\nThis is my actual sense at okay.\nThis is a neat cross\n8 LED display function.\nOkay.\nSo here what I'm going to do\nthat I'm going to eliminate\nthe First Column\nand the first two rows\nfrom the top.\nOkay, so this We will give me\na 6 cross 7 Matrix area\nremaining with me.\nOkay, this is\nwhere I'm going to do all\nmy operations from now onwards.\nSo this is something interesting\nand I'll help you understand why\nI am taking this region.\nNow before we move on let's take\na simple look with respect\nto the core present here.\nOkay.\nNow before I do that,\nlet me try to help\nyou understand why I have taken\na 6 cross 7 Matrix area.\nNow.\nThis was the remaining area.\nI have divided this remaining\narea into two parts.\nOkay.\nOkay, I'm just going\nto give a gap of one column\nbetween these two\nand the left hand side is going\nto represent the temperature\nor the value in tens place\nand the right hand side segment\nis going to give me the value\nin once place.\nSo this basically is\na 3 cross 5 Matrix where\nand I have 15 positions\nto play around with boom.\nBut this number again,\nthis is 15 areas that\nI can play around\nwith in a 3 cross Phi Matrix.\nNow, let's go back\nto our code now.\nLet me help you understand\nhow it works now.\nI have basically\n10 numbers with me.\nOkay.\nSo each one is going to have\na specific way of representing\nin a 3 cross five Matrix.\nSo that's what I\nhave written here\nin this number Matrix as such.\nOkay.\nSo each of the line\nis a representation\nof a corresponding number\nin a 3 cross 5 Matrix\nand this one and zero\nbasically is a configuration\nfor the LED to be either turned\non or turned off.\nSo normally when we\nwrite 0 the first line\nwill always be full.\nThe first three numbers are one.\nOkay, then you have 1 0 1.\nOkay again 1 0\n1 1 0 1 and my last three\nnumbers will be again one so as\nand when you represent\nzero in a normal form,\nthis is how you do that\nso it may not be so clear\nto you right now.\nOkay.\nSo what I would recommend is\nbefore you try to understand\nhow each of the numbers\nare displayed set an offset\non your sensor there\ntry playing around\nwith respect to different\nvalues to understand\nhow you can represent each\nof the numbers once Made\ntwo or three mistakes,\nthen you'll get a clear-cut\nunderstanding of how each\nof the numbers can be displayed.\nNow.\nThis is for a 3 cross\nPhi Matrix tomorrow.\nYou want to try it across the\nacross it you can do\nthat as well.\nSo definitely make sure to try\nout make mistakes only\nthen will you learn?\nOkay.\nSo each of the line is\na representation for a digit\nin a 3 cross Phi Matrix.\nNow, let's try to understand\nhow we can display\na single digit for that.\nI'm going to define a function\ncalled show digit, okay.\nOkay.\nSo this is the function it\ntakes a value as an input.\nOkay.\nIt takes a value for x\nd OK XD is the x-coordinate\nfor where the digit\nhas to be present yd is\nthe again the y-coordinate as\nto where the digit\nhas to be represented\nand the last is a simple\nRGB value present here.\nNow first thing\nwhat I'm going to understand is\nthat I'm going to compute\nthe offset position.\nOkay.\nWhy do I need to\ncompute an offset?\nBecause each of the\nnumbers are present\nin different rows of the call.\nSo I Need to understand\nwhich is the present number\nand which value do I\nneed so for that\nwhat I'll do is the incoming\nvalue into 15 will always put me\nat the start of that room.\nLet's say the value is 3, okay.\nSo 3 into 15 tells me\nthat I need to\nmove 45 positions.\nSo as I said\neach row has 15 so 15.\nOkay, then I have 30\nin the next row.\nOkay, and once I'm done with\nthe 45th transfer then I'm here.\nThis is the standard\nrepresentation for three.\n3 so I have this complete row\nat my disposal presently.\nI am pointing to the start\nof three value.\nOkay.\nSo this is something\nimportant to remember.\nSo this is why we\nare Computing an offset\nby multiplying the value in 250.\nSo I have the complete\naccess to this row.\nOkay now we'll try to execute a\nfor Loop through which\nI'll place these values\ninto the different parts\nof the LED display.\nOkay.\nNow see I have\nthree cross 15 area.\nSo I need to identify\nin which area should\nwhich Look up that is\nwhich led should be turned on.\nI have three rows and 5 columns.\nSo I need to identify this.\nLet's go back.\nNow.\nThe first thing\nthat I'm going to do is\nthat I'm going to compute x\nt OK XD basically is going\nto be the value of p modulo 3.\nOkay.\nThis basically is going\nto give me value of 0 1 or 2.\nOkay.\nSo if you go back\nto our presentation,\nit's either going to start\nfrom this 0th position\nor it is going to be\nin the first position or in\nthe second position.\nOkay, similarly in\nthe left hand side.\nAlso, it could be\nthis 0th position first position\nor second position.\nSo basically we are\ndividing this that's\nwhat you need to understand.\nOkay coming back.\nLet me just remove this.\nOkay.\nSimilarly.\nI'm going to compute my y\nof T by have to basically\nis to help me understand\nwhich value should I take\nfrom this complete row,\nso this will basically start\nfrom zero and go all the way\ntill 14 as such.\nOkay, so it will basically\nrepresent which column value\nshould I take So I\nhope you understand\nfrom this which column value\nshould I keep taking\nfor my next value.\nOnce I have this then\nwhat I'll do is I\nam going to call\nthe sense dot set pixel Rumba\nhow we had called sense -\nroh message so there\nand we had sent\na complete message.\nNow, what we're doing is\nthat we just sent to\neach of the pixels\nindividually as such.\nOkay, so we're going\nto use the x coordinate.\nOkay, which is going\nto be my x t plus XD.\nOkay.\nRemember this?\nOkay.\nWe'll Define X.\nStill it'll add but just\nkeep this in mind XT\nplus XD is going to give\nme the x coordinate y t\n+ yd is going to give\nme the y coordinate\nand then basically\nmy RGB number comes so here\nI have just done\na multiplication of P into R.\nSo whichever I want I'll\njust convert it accordingly.\nOkay.\nNow comes the choice of\nwhen you have to display\ntwo digit number.\nSo instead of going back\nto the same function.\nF defined a new function,\nwhich is called show number\nnow show number is\nThe original function\nthat will be caught\nbecause the temperature\nmeasured is most often\na two digit number.\nSo this is where the actual code\nwas going to start from.\nOkay.\nSo number takes four values.\nIt takes a variable called\nwhile which is\nthe present temperature.\nI have my RGB value as well as\nI'm going to begin the function\nhere firstly I'll begin\nby taking the absolute value\nof the given input.\nOkay, when I say absolute value,\nI am basically trying\nto identify the number present\nin the tens place.\nHe's okay.\nSo this is what absolute value\nwill be whatever the digit\nis present in the tens place.\nI'm going to store it\nin my abs underscore value\nso that I'm just\nproviding it here\nto the tens place then\nlet me also identify\nwhat is in units place and this\nis simple mathematical operation\nwhere I divide\nthe number by 10,\nI'm going to get a remainder\nand that's what I want.\nSo I'm going to use\na modular douche.\nSo my absolute value divided\nby 10 is going to give me\nthe unit's place as well.\nNow, what I'll do is I'll run.\nIf condition so here\nwhat I'm going to do\nif the value is greater\nthan 9 then I'm going to call\nthe show digit function\nwhich I had defined earlier\nand I'm going to pass\nthe tents value.\nOkay, the value present\nin the tens place.\nSo and then I'm going\nto also pass the XD n yd.\nIn this case x d + yd\nis going to be the offset left\nand offset top why let\nme help you understand here.\nMy offset top is going to be\nwith respect to this position.\nIt's going to start from here.\nOkay, so it will point\nto the third row.\nOkay my offset.\nLeft will point\nto Second column here.\nSo I know that this is\nwhere my tens place has to come.\nSo that's why\nI'm passing it here.\nOkay.\nI also am going to pass\nthe standard RGB value\nthat I have got input here then\nfor a second time.\nI'm going to call the show\ndigit function where and I\nwill pass the unit's place,\nbut with an offset\nof additional four spaces.\nOkay.\nSo this coming back\nto our segmentation.\nThis is going to be\nfour positions from our left.\nSo offset left is going to give\nme the first place but offset,\nPlus four is going\nto be the start place\nwhere I have defined\nfor my units place\nwhen I say from top it's worth\ngoing to be the same\nbecause I'm not separating with\nrespect to different levels.\nSo I'm just going to change\nwith respect to my offset left.\nOkay.\nSo that's the only difference\npresent here now coming down.\nWe are Computing the basic\ntemperature the humidity\nand pressure and then storing it\ninto a message string\nnow comes the place\nwhere I need to do\nmy actual implementation now\nif you remember\nour problem statement,\nWe have to send\nthe pressure temperature\nand humidity as a notification\non our mobile device.\nOkay, so for that I'm going\nto use in stop push\nwhich is an application\nthrough which I can send\nnotifications across my mobile.\nSo my python application\nthat is the final application\nwill communicate to install push\nand that will\nin turn communicate\nto my mobile application\nthat on which I\nhave configured it.\nOkay.\nSo the notification\nwill be received\non my mobile application\nnow coming down.\nMe remind you again\nwhy we are using this\nin a real world scenario.\nThis is something\nthat is being used by NASA.\nOkay, they're they're using\nit to identify\nif the exterior temperature is\nfalling between a specific range\nor even let's say\nif there's a change\nin the pressure inside the cabin\nor if the humidity is too high,\nso all this can be measured\nand you can get notified\nwith respect to any change\nthat you want.\nOkay now coming back\nto our program.\nThis is why I have defined\na range of cold and hot\nIf it falls below 37 degrees,\nI want a notification\nif it goes beyond 40,\nI want a notification.\nSo this is my range by value.\nIt should either be\nonly 38 or 39.\nOkay.\nSo this is why I am using\ncold and hot variables now.\nLet me help you understand\nhow the in stock push\napplication is working for that.\nLet me open my browser\nand show you how you\ncan configure in stock push for\nyour Raspberry Pi application.\nOkay.\nSo this is\nmy insta push homepage.\nOkay now first.\nSeeing what you need to do is\nthat you need to begin\nby creating a user ID credential\nhere and it is very important.\nWhen you logging\ninto your application,\nyou use the same credentials.\nSo make sure you\ndo not lose this\nbecause it's very important only\nif you use the same\ncredential will you get\nthis notification so remember\nthat so you have an option\nto sign up for free as well?\nOkay.\nAll you need to do is\nprovide your username provide\nyour email address\nand then specify a password now,\nlet me just log in.\nOkay, so I'm just logged in.\nOkay now here you can see\nthere's already a timeline\nbecause I have already\nconfigured this application.\nLet me help you understand\nhow you can do this now\nin my application.\nI already have a temp\nnotify application.\nOkay, which will be using as\npart of our understanding.\nOkay, firstly let me click\non ADD application now\nonce I do this I need\nto specify a name.\nSo let me just call it sample.\nOnce I click on Sample\nonce I press add\napplication sample gets created\nnow it is asking me\nto add event here.\nSo click on add event.\nSo let me call this temp rasp.\nOkay, and then tracker\nwould be message.\nMake sure you create a tab here\nafter you specify whatever it is\nthat you specify and here push\nmessage will be message.\nSo make sure it's present\ninside curly braces.\nWhat are we are specifying here.\nOnce this is done just click\non add event and this event\nis going to get added.\nOkay, so the event\nhas been added now it's time.\nI helped you understand\nwhy I had specified message\nthere so rumor let me go back.\nTo my code.\nRemember we had defined\nsomething known as push message.\nSo this is why I\nhave defined message here.\nSo this is\nwhat is going to be sent between\nmy final program application\nand my insta push application.\nSo this is why we had defined\nthis variable earlier as well.\nOkay now coming down\nwith respect to this.\nLet me go back to my insta push\nand let me help you understand.\nWhat all do you need\nbefore you move ahead?\nOkay, just go to the basic info\nTab and here there are\ntwo things that you need.\nOkay first.\nFirst you need\nyour application ID\nand then you need\nthe application secret.\nSo this is very similar to how\nyou have a user ID and password.\nSo this is what you're going\nto use in case you're working\nwith an application.\nOkay.\nSo make sure you note\nthis application ID\nand the corresponding\napplication password.\nNow if you come back\nto my program you can already\nsee I have mentioned\nthe application ID as\nwell as the application secret\nand here the push event is\nto my temp notify.\nSo this was the previous event\nthat was already set.\nSo I will be reviewing.\nBring to that as well.\nNow, what you need to do is\nthat you need to use Curl\nto post whatever data\nthat you have\nto the insta push API.\nSo for that you're going\nto use biker dot curl function.\nOkay, and this in turn\nwill help you communicate\nbetween your application\nand insta Porsche.\nOkay.\nSo all the communication\nis going to be\nthrough a variable called\nC. Now C dot set up.\nOkay here what I\nam going to specify is\nthat I'm going to specify\nthe URL first, okay.\nThe URL is going to be\nHTTP colon slash slash\na pi dot insta pushed IM /\nversion 1 / post.\nOkay.\nThere's also another\nalternative URL which is\nHTTP colon slash slash\na pi dot insta pushed IM /\npost itself now in case\nthe other is not working you\ncan use this or vice versa.\nOkay, moving forward.\nI need to set up\nthe customer headers basically\nfor my authentication\nand content type specification.\nOkay.\nSo for that you're going to use\nthe command C dot set of forward\nby C dot HTTP header.\nThen I'm going to specify x -\ninstall push -\na pi D plus my app ID,\nwhich I have specified earlier.\nSo this will help\nme identify to which up.\nThis has to be pushed.\nOkay.\nThe next is going to be x -\ninsta push - app secret.\nSo basically the app secret\nyour your password in this case.\nOkay, then comes\nthe content type.\nThat is what What type\nof content I go to pass\nso this is going to be\napplication dot Json.\nSo I'm basically going\nto pass a Json file to my API.\nOkay.\nSo I hope you guys\nare clear till here.\nOkay.\nNow what I'm going to do is\nthat I'm going to\ndefine the function\nthrough which the message\nis going to be passed.\nOkay.\nSo here what I'm going\nto do first is\nthat I'm going to use\na dictionary structure\nfor passing the data as Json\nin my post function.\nSo Jason -\nfield is going to\ncreate a dictionary\nand in through that\nI'm going to send this data.\nOkay.\nNow what I have to do is\nthat I have to specify\nthe field values.\nSo first comes the event, okay,\nwhich is basically\nwhat event I need to relate\nto then comes my tracker.\nI'm not specified any tracker\nas such then comes my message\nwhere and I'm going to pass\nthe push message push message\nbasically is the\ntemperature the pressure\nand the humidity as such now\nif you want you can print this\nbut I am not going\nto print it here.\nFinally.\nI'm going to use Json dot dump\nto make a Json file\nand going to assign it\nto post Fields variable.\nOkay.\nSo post field is the variable\nwhich I am going\nto pass to my APA.\nOkay next to send your Json file\nwith post use the following\ncommand C dot set-top.\nOkay inside which you're going\nto specify CDOT post field\nand you're going\nto pass this post field,\nwhich is the Json file\nas such then if you wish\nto capture the response,\nthen you can capture\nit inside a buffer.\nSo for that I am also going to\nuse a buffer to write operation\nand this can Done\nwith the following command C dot\nset up inside which I'm going\nto write C dot right function\nand buffer, right?\nThat is the right back\nhas to be into my buffer.\nOkay.\nNow if you want to be updated\nwhether the post\nhas been sent then you\ncan use the following command\nthat is C dot set top followed\nby C of C were Burrows.\nSo this will make sure\nthat I am getting posted\non my terminal with respect\nto the communication finally\ncomes our operation\nof checking the temperature.\nThis is very similar\nto what we have.\nI've done earlier\nwhere we are running\nan infinite Loop.\nI'm measuring my temperature\nin degree Centigrade.\nI'm measuring my humidity\nmeasuring my pressure\nstoring this value\ninside a message variable\nand then putting it\nto sleep simultaneously.\nI am also writing\ninto a log file\nand this is going\nto be stored with respect\nto the present time.\nOkay, so till here I\nhope you guys are clear\nnow comes the part where I\nhave identified my temperature.\nI'm just making sure\nit's an integer\nand then I'm going to call\nmy show number function.\nBut if we had defined a function\nbased on which it\nis going to be displayed\non my Raspberry Pi so this\nis a call to that function.\nOkay, once I\nhave done with this,\nI'm going to store it into temp\n1 then I will make sure\nthat I am writing it\ninto my file and then\ncomes the interesting part\nif my present temperature is\neither greater than or equal\nto the hot message\nor if it is lesser than or equal\nto a cold temperature\nthat we have defined rumor\nthe two variables.\nWe had defined earlier.\nThis is where they\nare being used.\nUsed.\nOkay, the push message\nwill start with either\nif it's hot or if it's code\nfollowing that would be\nthe present values.\nOkay, the pressure the\ntemperature and the humidity.\nOkay, then what I'm doing is\nthat I'm going to pass this push\nmessage to my P function\nthat I have just defined.\nSo basically it will first\nconvert the push message\ninto a Json data\nand then it will pass it\nthrough the communication.\nSo this is\nwhat is happening here.\nOkay.\nSame thing will happen in case\nit is the temperature Falls\nbelow the cold rain.\nGuess what?\nOkay, then I'm going\nto create a Json file\nand then call CDOT perform.\nSo this basically will initiate\nthe curl operation\nto start finally to capture\nthe response from the server.\nYou can actually\nuse the buffer rage.\nOkay.\nSo with this we have come\nto a conclusion.\nLet me just show you\nthe final part of this.\nOkay, so make sure\nthat you're closing\nthe communication through curl.\nSo you see door closed.\nOkay.\nThis will ensure\nthat the communication done\nthrough curl is closed as\nwell as you ensure\nthat the General purpose\ninput output is cleaned up\nso that new values\nare being taken.\nSo now let's execute\nthe final program.\nThat's python final\nprogram dot P by okay.\nNow as you see on\nthe Raspberry Pi it showing me\nthat it's presently\n35 degrees Centigrade, okay.\nOkay, I've started getting\nnotifications on my phone.\nLet me just share\nthis phone screen with you.\nOkay, and you can see there's\na variation with respect\nto the temperature shown\non the Raspberry Pi as well.\nOkay, let me show you\nfirst my phone screen.\nNow.\nIf you see here\nit's actually showing multiple\nnotifications being generated.\nOkay, it's showing me\nthat it's cold presently.\nAnd here's the complete list of\nthe temperature notifications.\nSo I'm getting a constant\nnotification with respect\nto the change in temperature.\nSo you can see it's continuously\nbeing Generated here as well.\nSo this is something\nthat is really helpful\nwhen you're working\naround with respect\nto a real-time scenario.\nSo like I said NASA\nextensively uses this\nfor their own purposes\nof measuring the\ntemperature pressure both\nin their scientific research\narea as well as the shuttles\nand space stations\nthat the user.\nOkay.\nSo with this we come\nto a conclusion\nof our demo session Raspberry Pi\nhas become the heart.\nOf The Internet of Things domain\nand camera is one\nof the most interesting modules\nthat you can add onto this\ninteresting Hardware as well.\nNow, let's begin by exploring\nthe pie camera for that matter.\nNow the pie camera was one\nof the best additions\nto the Raspberry Pi component\nbecause this module has helped\nthe users to use the perspective\nof camera into one\nof the smallest\nand the most\neffective combination\nof the internet of things.\nNow the main objective\nof the by camera module is\nto help you capture images.\nIt's capture videos time-lapses\neven slow motions as well.\nNow apart from this\nthe pie camera also helps\nyou capture videos in full HD\nat 30 frames HD at 60 frames\nand even Vijay videos\nat 90 frames as well.\nNow there are two versions\nof my camera that are out there.\nNow the latest version being\nthe camera module version 2,\nwhich was introduced\nin 2060 now,\nalthough there's not much\nof a difference\nbetween both these cameras.\nThere has been a slight increase\nin the resolution wherein\nyou had five megapixels\nfor the first module you have a\nIt's not and even the sensor\non board has been swapped out\nwhere in there was omnivision\nfor the first version now,\nit has been replaced by\na Sony sensor as well.\nNow talking about the by camera.\nYou need to be quite careful\nwhile you're working out\nwith the by camera.\nSo let me help you understand\nhow you can set up by camera\nwith your Raspberry Pi as well.\nNow, there are five different\nstages on setting up by camera\nwill be looking at each one\nof them one by one first.\nLet me help you understand\nhow to connect your pie camera\nto the Raspberry Pi now\nthis Is very important\nbecause we've used\nthree camera modules\nand we managed to burn\nout two of them.\nSo please be careful\nbecause this is\na very delicate ribbon\nand this is also\na very delicate module\nas such so let me\nhelp you understand\nhow you can attach the CSI cable\nto the Raspberry Pi\nand then I'll also\nhelp you understand.\nOnce you've done this\nhow to enable the camera as part\nof your Raspberry Pi as well.\nSo this is\nmy Raspberry Pi camera,\nand this is the version\n2 of the camera now\nif you notice this is the camera\nthat you can see\nand this is something\nthat's really difficult.\nIt gets a piece be careful.\nNow one thing\nthat I really want you to notice\nhere is the connector here.\nSo this is called The Sunny Side\nUp and this is called the silver\nand now you need\nto be really careful\nwhen you're plugging this so,\nlet me just bring in\nmy Raspberry Pi here as well.\nSo here we have\nour Raspberry Pi 3,\nand I'll just show you\nhow to connect this.\nThere are mainly two precautions\nthat you really need to consider\nwhile you're working\nwith the Raspberry Pi camera.\nOne thing is just please ensure\nthat the Raspberry Pi is\nSwitched Off or disconnected\nbefore you connect\nthe Raspberry Pi.\nCamera as well.\nThe this actually leads\nto a high chance\nof blowing up your camera.\nWe've already successfully\nmanaged to do that once so,\nplease ensure firstly\nthat the Raspberry Pi is\nSwitched Off and also\nthat the connection is correct.\nIf you notice the silver\nside present here,\nthis should be facing\nthe HDMI port\nthat is present here.\nNow in order to connect this\nlet me just slightly push it off\nand this slot needs\nto be slightly raised up.\nYou insert it like this.\nOkay.\nPlease be very careful.\nOnce you've successfully\ninserted it then just push\ndown the hinge as well.\nThis will lock it.\nSo make sure the silver side is\ntowards the HDMI\nand the Sunnyside is\nto your 3.5.\nMm Jack side as well.\nNow.\nIt's recommended that you get\na case wherein you can also\nsupport the camera\nbecause it's slightly\nchallenging because there are\nrubber in itself is delicate.\nSo when you get a case,\nwhich has the camera support,\nit will be really useful\nto you as well.\nSo it is a very delicate items.\nSo please be careful\nwhile you're working.\nThing with the Raspberry\nPi camera module moving on.\nLet's look at how to go\ninto the interface and enable\nthe Raspberry Pi camera module\nfor your Raspberry Pi as well.\nSo now that we\nhave successfully connected\nto our Raspberry Pi\nlet me show you\nhow to connect or enable\nthe Raspberry Pi camera\non your Raspberry Pi as well.\nNow, what I have done is\nthat I have established\na remote connection\nbetween my Raspberry Pi\nand my system using\nVNC viewer as well.\nSo this makes it quite easy\nfor me to show you\nwhat I'm doing\non my Raspberry Pi.\nSo once you have successfully\nconnected and turn down\nyour Raspberry Pi you\ncan go into the menu\nand then go to the preference\nsection here going.\nTo the Raspberry\nPi configuration.\nAnd what you need to do is go\ninto the interface section here.\nOnce you're here make sure\nthat you have enabled the camera\noption as well by default.\nThis would be disabled.\nNow.\nI have any able most of these\nfor different purposes\nso you can just enable\nthe camera option as well.\nOnce you're done with this then\nwe'll go on to the next stage,\nwhich is understanding\nhow you can capture images\nfrom the Raspberry Pi camera\nand how to capture video\nfrom Raspberry Pi camera\nas well now rasp eyes still\nis actually a shell command.\nWhich lets you Is\nthe camera module\nand capture an image now,\nthe command for capturing\nan image is rasp.\nI still -\noh and name of the image that\nyou want to store it as now -\noh is basically\nto open the camera\nand capture the image\nand at the same time\nif you want to rotate the image\nvertically or horizontally,\nyou just need to pass\nthe parameter - VF or -\nHatcher now both of this\nwill either flip it vertically\nor flip it horizontally\nand when you pass both of them,\nit will completely\nflip it around as\nwell now apart from this\nif you wish to capture a video\nfrom the Raspberry Pi\nyou can use the command\nr a spy with doing\nthis will help you\nagain capture the video\nfrom the camera module.\nNow, this is something\nthat gets stored by default as\na h.264 video as well.\nIf you wish to convert this you\ncan use the following command,\nwhich is sudo\napt-get install -\nwhy g-pack now?\nThis video will actually\nhelp you install MP4 box\nonto your machine\nand help you convert\nyour h.264 videos\ninto MP4 format as well.\nNow once you have it\nin MP4 format then Quite\neasy to play this video\nand check it out as well.\nNow again,\nif you want to run it\nfor a fixed duration,\nthen what you can do is\nthat you can also pass\nthe duration as part\nof the parameters\nwhile you're specifying\na spy with as well.\nNow one thing that you\nneed to keep in mind\nwhile you're doing this is\nthat the timeframe\nthat you're passing\nhere is in milliseconds.\nSo please be careful\nwhile you're doing this now,\nalthough I am specifying 10,000.\nIt's only for 10 seconds\nthat the video is going\nto be captured as well.\nNow, let me help you understand\nhow you can do all this.\nBy using a python function\nrather than a shell command\nas well for that.\nWhat you need to do is\nthat you need to install\na package called by camera.\nOnce you've done this\nthen you can easily access\nor you can easily perform\nall the operations as part\nof your Python program using\nthe pike Ram module as well.\nNow, what you need to do is\nthat first you need to update\nall the packages that you want.\nThen you need to install\nthe python by camera\npackage that's present.\nNow if you have two versions\nof python on your machine\nthat I would recommend\nthat you run both these commands\nthat is python -\nby camera and by In 3 -\nbye camera this\nin turn will ensure\nthat you have the 2.7\nand version as well as\nthe three-point X version\nof Pi camera present\non your machine as well.\nYou can also install Pi camera\nusing pip install as well.\nSo the command is pseudo pip\ninstall Pi camera as such moving\non let's talk about how you\ncan actually create a program\nor how you can use\na Python program\nto record the videos\nfor the same 10 seconds.\nNow earlier.\nWhat I had done is\nthat I had just mentioned\nthat run for 10 seconds\nusing the Shell command r a spy\nwith but Technically speaking.\nThis does not really account\nfor all the challenges\nthat may come across\nwhile you're actually\ncapturing a camera now that is\nwhere you use a Python program\nto help you ensure\nthat even if an exception\nis come across then\nyou can handle it\nand due to that will\nbe actually using the\nwith statement here firstly\nwhat I would like to do.\nI would like to import\nthe time package of now\nimporting the time package\nalso helps me access\nto the pi camera module\nand the by camera function\nwill in itself connect\nto the pie camera module\nand the data\nthat comes With them\nnot when I'm using\nwith function here this\nin turn will actually help me\nin handling all the exceptions\nand encapsulating\nthe proper tasks\nand cleaning up\nthe tasks as well.\nSo basically becomes\na best practice\nwhile you're using the by camera\nor while writing any codes\nfor that matter.\nSo most of us programmers\nwould like to consider\nall the scenarios\nand take care of it.\nAnd in this case python\nhas given as the with statement\nto it take care of it as well.\nNow if I use the command\ncamera dot start with you,\nwhat is going to happen is\nthat it's going to give me\na Review of what my camera is C\nand I call a sleeve\nfor 10 seconds\nthis in turn will ensure\nthat for the next 10 seconds.\nThe camera preview is\non once that's done.\nI'm going to stop the preview.\nSo what I have here is a preview\nof what my camera is seeing\nfor 10 seconds as well.\nBut this is not\nwhere it restricts.\nThere are various other commands\nthat my pie camera brings in\nas well talking\nabout these commands\nwhen I use the command\ncamera dot capture.\nIt captures an image\nand Camera dot start recording\nand stop recording\nwill in turn help me.\nDid a video as well if I go back\nto my previous program\nhere here I can also\nwrite camera to capture\nin order to capture the image\nbetween the 10 seconds\nor what I can also do is\nthat I can also start recording\nat the same time as well.\nSo I started recording Let\nit wait for 10 seconds,\nand then I stop\nthe recording as well.\nSo these are different commands\nthat you usually use\ntogether apart from this\nif you want to capture a stream,\nthen you can use camera\nto capture my streams followed\nby what type of stream\nthat you want to store\nit as well now\nif you wish To stream the video\nthat is coming from your\nRaspberry Pi then you can use\nthe command camera dot captures\nfollowed by my stream\nand the type of stream\nthat you wish to store.\nNow again, this also\ncan be recorded wearing you use\ncamera dot start record.\nIt captures the stream\nand you specify the quantization\nthat is needed to this as well.\nAgain, if you wish to play\nwith some of these properties\nof the camera as well,\nyou can play around\nwith the brightness.\nYou can change the resolution\nand you can even add a weight\nwith respect to it.\nSimilarly as you have\na timer function in\nyour standard cameras the same.\nBe used here as well.\nSo let's say I want to start\nthe recording after 5 seconds.\nI can do that as well.\nNow with this,\nlet's come to the demo\nof this session.\nNow, this is a slightly\ninteresting demo.\nI'm quite sure most\nof you are looking forward\nto this as well.\nThen we'll try to\nhelp you understand\nhow you can actually set\nup a security camera\nat your home as well.\nNow talking about the overall\nsystem here now here,\nwhat I would like to do is\nthat I would like to capture\nthe image of anyone\nwho comes to my door.\nOnce that's done I would check\nif this person is a recognized\nperson or is it someone\nthat already has\naccess to the house?\nIf not, I can always\nprompt my user\nand And give access to it.\nIf not, I can deny access to it.\nNow to those of you actually see\nin our iot projects video.\nYou would have noticed\nthat in Mark Zuckerberg section.\nHe had actually\nallowed his parents.\nNow, I do not want\nto manually have to do this\nwhen I just automatically allow\npeople to do this as well.\nThat's a smart system\nor that's an enhanced system\nthat we really would love\nto achieve as well.\nSo we would not be\ncompletely able to achieve it\nbut we will take\nour tiny steps towards it\nand we can all enhance it as\nper our requirements as well.\nSo firstly what\nWe're going to do is\nthat we're going\nto detect the face.\nWe're going to gather this data.\nWe're going to compare it\nand then we're going to start\nrecognizing data as well.\nNow again, this is\na learning process\nthat takes place.\nThis is something\nthat involves a lot\nof understanding and this\nslightly gets interesting\nfor most of you as well.\nNow when we talk\nabout face detection now,\nthe first stage\nof face detection is\nVerena program actually decide\nwhether an image has a face\nor it does not and this stage\nin itself is called\na classifier as well.\nIn order to achieve this opencv\nactually provides us\nwith to pre trained\nand ready to use\nface detection classifiers,\nwhich are part of it.\nWe have the half classifier\nand we have the LBP\nclassifier as well.\nNow one thing that you\nneed to notice or one thing\nthat you need to keep in mind\nwhile you're working\nwith this is\nthat the classifiers\nthemselves process the image\nwhile they are in grayscale\nas well because it gives\nthe machine quite Clarity on\nwhether to classify it\nor not as such now\nwhen I talk about each\nof the classifiers\nwhether I talk about\nthe heart classifier\nor the LBP classifier,\nEach has its pros and cons.\nSo let's actually try\nto understand this.\nNow the concept of phase\ndetection is not something\nthat's quite alien to most\nof you and I'm quite sure\nyou've all seen it be it\nin our Facebook applications\nSnapchat.\nSome of us have also seen it\non the ATM machines as well.\nWe're in Phase\ndetection is incorporated.\nAnd if you wish the most\nsimplest methodology or\nif you want to see\nthe most common example\nthat's out there\nfor face detection\nor face recognition.\nYou can see it in most\nof the phones today\nas well again here.\nWhat happens is\nthat The two algorithms\nthat are most widely used are\nthe higher classifier\nand the LBP classifier as well.\nSo again, both of these classify\nare mostly processing\nthe images in grayscale\nbecause we don't actually need\nthe color related\ninformation to decide\nif there is a face\nor not now again,\nthere are going to be\ntwo classifications present here\nthe computer program\nwhich actually decide\nwhether there is\na positive aspect\nwhere in the phase is present\nor the negative aspect where\nthe face is not present or so.\nSo this is how you\ndecide or this is\nwhat you Call a classifier\nfor that matter now in opencv\nas we have seen.\nThere are two\ndifferent classifiers,\nwhich is the higher classifier\nand the LBP classifier as well.\nNow again, when you talk\nabout the higher class\nwhere it is actually\na machine learning approach\nthat we take a\nand this was created by\nPaul y Le and Michael Jones\nwherein they are trained\nmany positive images\nand negative images\nwithout faces as well.\nNow this intern actually\nstarted helping them understand\nthat extracting feature\ntakes quite some time\nand if you consider\nboth What segments\nwhen you consider higher\nand LBP had actually takes\nup slightly more time.\nBut at the same time\nit gives you a slightly more\nprecise solution as well.\nNow what it actually does\nis it actually considers\nthe adjacent pixels\nto the region\nwhere the face is protected\nand then it actually\nsums up the intensity\nof these pixels in each\nof these regions as well.\nOnce it's done.\nIt actually calculates the\ndifference between these sums\nand then it uses\nthem to differentiate\nbetween the section\nand the subsection\nof the Ages as well now\nwhen it comes to the LBP\nsection of this here,\nit creates a 3 cross 3 window\nat the time of image as well.\nThen what happens is\nthat it starts comparing\nfrom the Centre pixel\nwith all the other pixels\nwhich are greater\nor equal to the value\nwhich is set as 1\nor 0 as well then again,\nit goes on to read\nthe binary value\nin a counterclockwise order\nand converts it to decimal\nwhich are Center values\nof the pixel as well.\nNow what happens is\nthat this process is completely\nrepeated one after the other\nand you An easier or a smarter\nsolution to this as well.\nNow again,\nas we have discussed both\nof them have an advantage\nand a disadvantage\nas we are talking\nabout the half classifier there.\nIt has a very high accuracy\nwhen it comes to detection\nof face and there's quite\nminimalistic false positive.\nBut the challenge is\nthat the computational time\nthat it takes is quite slow.\nAnd again, the training time\nthat it takes is quite long as\nwell and even in dark segments,\nit's not quite accurate as well\nbecause it fires High Clarity\nwith respect to the images\nor the scanning area\nthat it takes in the picture.\nBut at the same time\nwhen you look at LBP\nclassifier its computation\nand training time is actually\nquite fast and shorter\nwhen you compare\nto the hard classified as\nwell now it is quite robust\nwhen to any elevation changes\nthat is when there's\na change in lighting.\nIt's still comfortable\nand capable of handling this\nbut at the same time\nit's not quite accurate\nor it's not on the same level\nat the same time\nhas a high chance of false\npositive fatigue as well now.\nMove on forehead.\nLet me just show you about\nthese packages slightly better.\nNow.\nIf you come into\nyour opencv package now,\nI would recommend\nthat you download the opencv\nlibrary from GitHub itself.\nAnd if you come\ninside the segment\nand you go inside data\nwhat you can see here are\nthe different hard classifiers\nand LBP Castle path.\nNow, if you go inside\nthe hair Cascade section here,\nyou can find different\nXML files present here,\nwhich will help you understand\nor help you recognize\ndifferent aspects of a body\nit can start from I you\ncan start go to I classes\nAnd then sue forward as but now\nwhat will mainly be using is\nthat we'll be using\nthe frontal face segment here.\nOkay.\nAnd again, these are XML files.\nSo even if you open them\nand if you see them you\nwould not perfectly\nget a clear-cut idea\nbut this is something\nthat we have to use as part\nof our program as well.\nMeanwhile while this is opening.\nLet me go back.\nLet me show you\nthe lpp segment as well.\nOkay.\nNow what you see here\nare different values\nthat are associated\nin these are different values\nto help you identify\nor help you understand\nhow the face recognition\nshould take place as such.\nOkay.\nNo again.\nIt's a very huge document.\nSo what they're trying to do is\nthat it again going to try\nto restructure it again.\nI think you've got\na simple idea at this point.\nSo let me just close\nthis and let me go back now\nif you check the LBP\nCascade segment as well here\nyou have different segments.\nSo again, what we'll be using is\nthat we'll be using the frontal\nface segment as such.\nSo what I've done is\nthat I've just created\na separate folder\nwhere I've kept my program\nand these two opencv files\nfor different algorithms\nas well now coming back\nwe've done with our\ndetecting the face.\nLet's talk about Using our faces\nas well now till here\nwhat I have done is\nthat I have detected my face,\nbut I need to start\nrecognizing this face as well.\nSo face recognition\nmainly can be classified into\nthree different steps first.\nI've actually dealing\nwith the data Gathering stage\nnow in the stage,\nwhat you're mostly\ngoing to do is\nthat you're going to gather\nany relevant information\nwith respect to that face.\nSo usually this is done\nwhen you have multiple photos\nof a person and then\nyou start identifying\nor you start training\nyour machine on this face\nand then it starts recognizing\nthe Face every time\nthat it comes up with an image\nof the same as well.\nNow there are\nthree different functions\nthat opencv provides us\nto do this and let me give you\na brief idea on each of them\nso that you know,\nwhich to use well now first\ncomes the Eugene faces now\nEugene freezes actually\ntakes all the images\nat once looks for all\nthe important and useful\ncomponents in these phases\nwhich are known\nas principal features\nand then passes it\non now one key factor\nthat makes or one key challenge\nwith respect to the Eugene.\nPhase function is\nthat it requires a good\namount of Illumination.\nBut at the same time\nwhen you have your fish your\nface here individually images\nor individually features\nare extracted rather than\nextracting one by one\nand this in turn actually\ndoes not have a challenge\nwith the illumination segment\nas such third is your lbph,\nwhich is your low\nbinary pattern histogram\nand this is very similar\nto your LBP as but but\nwhat happens here is\nthat you create a binary Matrix\nand convert into decimal factor\nand then you actually Not\na histogram with respect to it.\nSo what happens here is\nactually a comparison\nwith respect to the histograms\nthat are present.\nSo each phase will\nhave a correspondingly\ndifferent histogram\nand I just compare\nthese histograms to in order\nto identify which phase\nit is belonging to now.\nLet me come back to my place\nwhere you buy and\nbefore I go forward\nas we said this segment\nactually deals with two parts\nfirst is actually\ncapturing the detection\nand the second is\nwith the recognition part.\nSo let me first show you\nhow you can detect it now.\nWe've already discussed above.\nAbout detection or how to\ncapture any intrusion detection\nin our Raspberry Pi 3 tutorial\nwhere we actually capture\nsomeone opening the door\nand coming in as well.\nOnce I've captured this image.\nThen I need to start\nrecognizing now first.\nLet me show you\nthis program here.\nIf you want more details\non how it works out then\nyou can definitely check\nout our Raspberry Pi\n3 tutorial as well.\nNow if I use the following code,\nlet me just expand this a bit\nso that I think you\nmay not be visible to you.\nWe just increase the font size.\nYeah, I know.\nI think you can all see\nmy code as well.\nNow again, we're using\ndifferent packages here\nyou using user Library CV\nto the time and numpy as well.\nNow, I'm first going\nto set the first frame\nthen I'm going to decide\nwhether there's any\ndetection as well.\nOkay.\nNow for this\nas we have mentioned\nin our Raspberry Pi 3 tutorial,\nyou can use the IP\ncamera application\nwhich is an Android application\nand you get an IP address\nas well or a URL\nwhich have specified here.\nNow, let me just run\nthis and show you\nwhat I'm seeing at this moment.\nNow what it's going\nto do also is\nthat it's going\nto capture the last image\nthat the camera sees as well.\nSo any change\nwith respect to it?\nIt's going to overwrite\nuntil I quit or I exit\nfrom the program\nas such so let me just run this.\nI just zoom in a bit.\nSo let me go back\nto my desktop and I'll run\nthe camera application.\nNow what it's doing is\nthat it's connecting\nto my phone camera\nand it's going to create or show\nyou what I'm seeing or what.\nMy phone is seeing\nat the moment.\nSo what you see in is\nmy Raspberry Pi set up here\nas you can see,\nit's set up on a curve\nbecause it's slightly tends\nto get heated up,\nbut you can see it's\na separate device as well.\nSo this is my first frame\nand what I'm going to do is\nthat I'm going to put my hand\nin front of it and I'm going\nto make this as my last frame\nas well while this remains.\nI'm going to press\nQ to quit from this.\nAnd it also has created\nan image called test\ndot jpg here as well.\nLet me just open this and\nif you see it's my hand\nthat has been captured.\nSo what happens here is\nthat it captures the last\nin frame as well.\nSo if you want to get\na better understanding\nof which image it captures\nwill rerun this but before that,\nlet me just remove this file.\nOkay.\nSo let me just send\nit to the waste bin.\nAnd then what we'll do is we\njust re execute this program.\nI'll start by keeping my hand in\nthe front of the camera itself.\nSo this is my first frame, okay.\nAnd any change to this\nlet me I'll just move\nit off completely.\nSo this is going\nto be my last frame\nand I press Q to quit\nfrom this and let's\njust recheck the image as well.\nSo you can see it\nhas captured the last frame\nas such with respect to this.\nSo it's a very interesting thing\nfor capturing this\nand now let's actually come\nnow into our program\nwhich talks about\nface recognition and\nface detection as well.\nSo this is the program\nthat will help me detect\nthe face train my application\nand also understand which face\nbelongs to whom as well.\nSo I have imported my opencv\nto because that is\nwhere my face detection\nand face recognition.\nAlgorithms are present.\nI'm going to use\nthe OS module here as\nwell because I need access\nto the drives our the path\nwhere these images are going\nto be stored as well\nand numpy is one of the very\nKey Programs of is one\nof the very key modules,\nwhich is required for any face\ndetection recognition as well.\nBecause the information\nthat you're going to be using\nwould be stored as a numpy array\nfor that matter.\nNow again,\nwhat I'm going to do is\nthat I'm going to actually\nidentify the face\nof three people.\nOkay.\nI'm going to identify\nwhether the image\nthat I'm passing is of Ronaldo\nis of messy or is off Robin.\nOkay.\nOur if it does not fall\ninto either of these three,\nit's going to give\nit as null as well.\nNow our first program\nor the first function\nthat we're going to be\nworking is with respect\nto detecting the fixed.\nNow, as I said,\nall the images are going\nto be converted into grayscale.\nSo that's what I'm\ngoing to be using.\nC V2 dot CVT color\nto grayscale conversion.\nOnce this is done.\nI'm going to create a face\nCascade for that matter.\nNow C V2 dot Cascade classifier\nactually specifies which kind\nof classifier to be used.\nNow for this program.\nWe're going to be using\nthe LBP classifier.\nOkay.\nAnd as you see it's\nfor the frontal face as well.\nWe've seen there are different\naspects but we're going\nto be using LBP frontal\nface classifier as such now\nthis phase is going to store\nthe list of all the faces\nthat I'm going to be detecting\nor I'm going to be identifying.\nOkay.\nSo for this what I'm\ngoing to do is is\nthat I'm going to specify\nface underscore casket\nand then I'm going\nto ask it to detect\nin multi scale parameter.\nSo I'm going to say it has\nto identify in grayscale.\nThe scaling factor\nof the image is set as 1 Point\n2 and the minimum number\nof pixels that it\nshould consider is 5 okay.\nNow if no faces are detected\nfrom the images\nthat I pass then it has\nto pass the parameter as none.\nBut if it is detected then I\nwant all the four coordinates\nwith respect to\nthe X and y-axis,\nwhich I'm going to be storing\nin XY W and Okay,\nX Y width and height\nwith respect to smarter\nor I'm going to specify\nwhich part of the image\ndoes the face actually contain.\nSo I'm going to specify with\nrespect to the four coordinates\nthat I'm going to be passing.\nOnce this is done.\nThen I'm going to define\nthe next function\nwhich is to prepare my data now\nas we've seen first comes\ndetection then comes preparing\nwhen it comes to it.\nI need to specify the path\nfrom where it has to pick up\nthe images for that matter.\nSo let me come back.\nLet me show you\nwhere the images are.\nIsn't now when you see\ninside training data folder.\nOkay, I have actually\nthree folders present here,\nwhich is my S 1 S 2 and S 3\nif I go inside as one\nyou can see there is\na Ronaldo's photos.\nIf I go back\ninto S 2 you can see\nthat is Messi's photos.\nAnd if you see inside S3,\nthis Robbins photos\npresent here now.\nLet me come back\nto the core now here.\nWhat I'm doing is\nthat I'm passing the path then\nI'm calling the phase function\nas well as the labels.\nNow again, the phase is going\nto hold the sub phases\nof all the subjects\nand labels actually.\nHelp me identify which\nit belongs to as well.\nNow what it's going to do is\nthat it's going to run a for\nLoop wherein it goes through.\nEach of the images\nis present in the path.\nNow again,\nwhat we have decided\nor what we have started\nwith the naming convention\nis with s 1 2 3.\nSo what it's going to do is\nthat it's going to check\nif the folder name starts with s\nbecause usually there are\nsystem photos separately.\nSo it is going to check\nif the folder name starts with s\nif it does not then it's going\nto go into the next Loop.\nBut if it does it will check\nthat folder as well.\nThen what is going to do is\nthat it's going to create\nthe label for it\nor it's gonna identify\nwhich folder I'm presented.\nIf you actually go back inside\nback to my training data,\nyou can see I have specified\n1 2 3 after this so it's just\nto help me identify which label\nit belongs to as well.\nYou can use any different\nnaming conventions\nthat you want as such then\nwhat I'm going to do is\nthat I'm going to specify\nwhere the folder\nor where the images is present,\nwhich is actually\none level inside this\nso I'm going to go\ninto the next directory.\nAnd then what I'm going to do is\nthat I'm going to run a for\nLoop for all the images.\nAre present in this\nif an image or a file\nfor that matter starts with DOT\nbecause system files\nusually start with DOT.\nSo those are going to be ignored\nbut others are going\nto be recognized using my opencv\nwhere and I'm going\nto read the image first.\nI'm going to show you a message\nthat says training on the data.\nI'm going to resize\nthe image to a size\nthat is comfortable for me,\nwhich is 400 pixel\nto find a picture.\nOkay, and then I'm going to wait\nfour hundred milliseconds\nfor that matter.\nNow what you can see here is\nthat I'm calling\nto detect phase function\nwhich is present earlier.\nYeah, so this again is a call\nback to the previous function\nwhere it goes up and it actually\ncalls the previous function\nthat we have created\nto detect the face as well.\nOnce that is done.\nIt's also going to revert\nwith me the position\nas well as the face\nor the ID which it\nbelongs to as well.\nNow if a phase is present\nthen I'm going to append it\nto my face list\nand I'm also going to add\na label to this face as well.\nOnce this is done.\nI'm going to\ndestroy these windows\nbecause again opencv\ncreates a lot of windows,\nso I'm going to ensure\nthat it's destroyed\nby doing it twice as well.\nThis is done.\nI'm going to return the This\nwhich I have and the labels\ncorrespondingly as well.\nNow what you need\nto understand is\nthat here the faces here are\nof different players as well.\nSo each of the phases present\nin each of these images\nis going to be segregated.\nIt's going to store\nthis into a location\nand it's going to start\nraining on them as well.\nThen what I'm going to do is\nthat I'm going to prepare\nthe training data.\nNow this again is something\nthat is becoming a recursive\nfunction for that matter.\nIt's going to be\ncalling itself again\nwhere it goes back it\ngoes to one level up\nand it's going to\nkeep calling itself\nuntil I have trained\non all the folders\nwhich are present\nand all the images present\ninside that folder as well.\nSo once this is done\nwhat happens is\nthat it prints me\nthat data has been prepared.\nAnd then it also tells me\nthe total number of faces\nand the total number\nof labels also present here\nas such finally\nwhat I'm going to do is\nthat I'm going to create\nour LVH be faced a cognizer.\nSo for this I'm going\nto call the lbs be faced\na cognizer function.\nSo if you remember\nwe had discussed\nabout three different\nphase secondary functions,\nwe're going to be using\nthe LBH be faced\na cognizer function figure.\nThe function has been defined\nthen I'm going\nto pass these faces\nso that my machine can learn\nand train itself to identify\nthese phases in future.\nNow, what I'm going to do is\nthat I'm going to just create\na rectangle across their faces.\nSo that becomes\na differentiating factor\nfor them or helps them separate\nwhere the faces with respect\nwhere and once\nthis is defined or\nonce I have created a rectangle\nacross their face again,\nthese XY heads\nthat are the different\ncoordinates of the face,\nand I'm just going to draw\na rectangle across them.\nAnd again, I'm going\nto specify which color\nso this is your RGB value.\nSo it's going to be\na green color box\nthat's going to be defined\nand I'm also going\nto print the name\nof the person present here.\nSo what it's going to do is\nthat it's going to identify\nwhich person it belongs\nto and it's going to print\nit in hen seaplane.\nOkay.\nAnd what is going to do is\nthat it's going to be printed\nagain in green color as well.\nNow what I comes or now the most\nimportant function comes\nwhich is prediction.\nNow in production,\nwhat I'm going to do is\nthat I'm going to pass\nan image the image copy\nis going to be created.\nAs we do not want to manipulate\nor work on a single copy\nof an image because in case\nof any challenge or any issues,\nwe do not want to overwrite\nor lose the image\nfor that matter.\nOnce this is done then\nwhat I'm going to do is\nthat I'm going to call\nthe detect phase function\nwhich in turn will help me\nidentify who the person is then\nwhat is going to do is\nthat it's going to predict the\nimage using our face a cognizer\nand then it's also going\nto print the confidence\nor how sure it is\nthat this face matches.\nNow what I want you\nto understand here is\nthat if my confidence\nis low 30 that is\nif I'm not sure\nthat this person's\nimage is correct\nor the phrase is detected then\nwhat happens is\nif it is greater than 30\nis going to draw a rectangle\nand then it's going to write\nwho the person belongs to\nand it's going to return\nthis image for me\non the screen as well.\nNow why have two images\nthat I'm going\nto be passing here?\nIf I just go\nonto my desktop images show\nyou first is abc dot jpg,\nand the second is wrong dot\none dot jpeg as well.\nSo let me just show\nyou the images.\nSo you can see here.\nI have drawn dot\none dot jpeg,\nwhich is an image of Ronaldo.\nAnd I'm also going\nto pass a b c dot jpeg\nwhich is an image of messy.\nOkay.\nSo these are the two images\nI want to identify\nand I will be passing\nthis to my program.\nLet me just run this program\nso that you get a full\nfledged understanding of\nwhat we have written here.\nAnd you understand\nhow this works out as well.\nOkay.\nSo once I've passed this image,\nthen I'm going to call\nthe predict function\nso that it predicts whose face\nthat this belongs to Two\nor who's this face is as well.\nOnce that's done.\nI'm going to destroy this now.\nI hope you've got\na simple understanding of this.\nIf you are interested\nin the code,\nplease give us your mail ID.\nWe will be happy to share\nthe code with you as well.\nNow.\nLet me just execute this\nso that you get a clearer\nunderstanding of this.\nNow, let me just zoom in\nso that you know,\nso you can see it\nhas started picking up\nthe faces for recognition.\nSo you can see it starting\nto prepare the data.\nIt's checking out\nall the images.\nIt's reading the faces is trying\nto detect the fuses for itself.\nNow you can see\ntotal faces are 22 wherein\nit has identified 22 images\nand it also has started\nto predict it\nand it's given me the confidence\nof the face detection\nthat it has taken place as well.\nNow the prediction\nhas completed for Ronaldo.\nIt has successfully\npredicted the face\nand it also has put in the text\nand if you see for Messi also,\nit has done the same\nbut the text is very small here\nbecause the image has been\nresized for that matter.\nOkay, so it has successfully\npredicted this it has detected.\nIt also has recognized\nit as well now.\nHas also told me who\nthis face belongs\nto as such for that matter.\nSo this is\nhow our face recognition\nsystem works completed.\nNow, this is just one\nof a very my new door one of\nthe basics examples of this\nand if you want to create\na complete full fledged system,\nlet me give you an idea\non that same as well.\nNow if you wish to have a very\ngreat system out of something\nthat's really effective\nout there something\nthat's not too hard\nto build then this is something\nthat you should really\nconsider place your camera,\nwhich is a wireless camera\non top of your door.\nOkay, use the Raspberry Pi\nto detect the motion.\nWhat will happen here?\nIs that every time there is\na detection Raspberry Pi\nwould detect this happens\nand then it would pass\non this information\nonto the cloud the reason\nfor doing this is\nthat it becomes quite fast\nand it's way more effective\nin that matter as\nwell here the phase\nwould be detected recognition\nwould happen all the information\nregarding these phases would\nbe present on the cloud itself.\nAnd once it has identified\nthat this is a valid\nuser then correspondingly.\nIt will allow the door\nto be opened as well.\nBut what you need\nto understand here is At this\nin turn can also be configured\nfor you to have an application\nor a notification sent on\nto your mobile application\nfrom the cloud as well.\nBecause most of the mobile\napplication Epi is\nfor pushing information is\nvery easily accessible\nand configurable on the cloud\nas such the Raspberry Pi has\nbecome the most popular platform\nfor exploring the no House\nof Internet of Things.\nIt is redefining\nthe nuances for a new era\nof minimal operating software.\nAnd if it's\nabout operating systems,\nyou can be sure to find\nMicrosoft Windows just\naround the corner.\nSo we'll be talking\nabout the Windows 10 today,\nbut not the one\non your desktops or laptops.\nIn fact, not even the one\non your smartphones\nthis Windows operating software\nruns devices even\nsmaller than any of those now,\nif you've been tinkering\nwith the Raspberry Pi you\nmust try installing\nthe Windows 10 iot core on it\nand know the operating systems\nthat come as a part\nof the Windows 10 iot windows\nthat is fairly popular\namongst operating systems is\nnow available for Internet\nof Things is actually a revamp\nof the old operating\nsystem Windows embedded\nbut with iot taking the World by\nstorm the Windows 10 iot is now\nit's official operating\nsoftware for all\neverything's and systems.\nNow the windows\nfor Internet of Things comes\nin three packages the Windows\n10 iot Enterprise comes\nfor the embedded systems\nthat draw more power\nand require more resources\nlike the bulkier systems\nin high grade\nor industrial grade Machinery\nthe Windows iot\nmobile Enterprise comes\nfor more minimal systems\nlike the ones in our televisions\nor handled it.\nVices and the Windows\n10 iot core comes for\nthe smallest embedded systems\nin iot like even minut\ncombinations of microcontrollers\nand microprocessors.\nSo you can scale up\nor scale down these options\naccording to iot devices\nand the requirement now\nthe Windows 10 iot code\nis the smallest\nof the three operating systems\nlaunched by windows\nfor The Internet\nof Things it in fact\nis the smallest operating system\nthat Windows has ever had\nand you will be happy to know\nthat this one comes\nfor free now this windows\nfor small devices is so minimal.\nIt's interface is\nunlike any of the other\nWindows operating systems\nand it is almost like that\nof a bear Windows kernel\nbut it is just about enough to\npower the things in iot run all\nof its applications\nand ensure the seamless flow\nof data to and from the cloud.\nIt also supports many other\nwords used in iot development,\nbut we be focusing\non its installation\non the Raspberry Pi today.\nNow, it's minimal interface is\nfor better convenience as\nwhenever an application\ngets deployed to run\non the Windows iot core the\nwindows interface will disappear\nand all you'll be left\nwith is the application.\nRunning on it.\nNow this is because the Windows\n10 iot has been designed to run\nboth headed and headless\nwhich essentially means\nwith and without a display.\nSo your device\nbecoming the application\nwill reduce confusion\nwhile running headless.\nThis also means\nthat we can have only one active\napplication running at a time\nwhile there could be\nother background applications\nrunning all that said\nI think it's finally time.\nWe went over the installation\nof the Windows 10 iot core\non the Raspberry Pi\nso I have a Raspberry Pi\n3 here with me already\nand a class 10 SD card of 16GB\nupon which Be flashing\nour operating system.\nAnd please make sure\nthat you SD card is at least\nclass 10 and has a capacity\nof at least 8 GB\nwithout these you\nmight face compatibility issues\nwith the windows iot\ncore operating system.\nNow the Samsung Evo\nor the SanDisk Ultra\nwould be your best choices.\nSo the first thing to do is\nto format the SD card.\nI recommend using\nthe SD card format or software\nthat is available\nfor free online.\nYou could also use the default\nformat on your system,\nbut I'd avoid using it as it\ndoes not optimize the partition.\nRequired by the operating system\nand the storage on SD card\nand it compromises\non the entire capacity\nthat is available.\nSo go on with the SD\ncard for matter,\nso it is really easy to get\nwe start by opening a browser\nand typing SD card for matter\ninto it and hit enter\nso you can go to the first link.\nAnd scroll down\nonce the website opens\nso you can see SD memory\ncard format a download\nfor Windows and Mac\nsince we need the Windows\noperating system to flash\nthe windows iot core or to\nthe Raspberry Pi will be going\nfor the windows version of it.\nSo click on it and you\ndownload should be initiated.\nSo once you download\nis done find the setup file\nand install SD card format\nIran to system.\nI've already done that\nso I will straight away go\nand open the app.\nAnd here it is.\nSo you'll have to know\nwhich Drive is your SD card\nmounted on for that.\nWe can go to my PC or this PC.\nSo in my case,\nit is the F drive.\nSo I'll make sure\nthat the card is wanting\nto the F drive\nand I'll click on format.\nIt will give you an alert saying\nthat it is all data\non this card hit.\nYes.\nThere we go.\nNow we are ready for the windows\niot core download.\nSo we go back to the browser\nand we type windows iot.\nSo the first website\nis the official website\nfor Windows 10 iot core.\nOnce the web page loads go\nto the download section\nand you can see there's\na download link saying\ndownload the Windows\n10 iot core dashboard.\nSo this is\nwhat will be downloading.\nSo we'll be installing\nthe operating system\nthrough this dashboard itself.\nLet's go to the download\nfolder find the setup file\ndouble-click on it.\nAnd click install.\nSo it's a 58 Point 1 MB file.\nSo it is getting downloaded\non the Windows\n10 iot core dashboard from\nwhere we will be installing\nand flashing it\nonto our SD card.\nSo once the setup is done,\nthe windows iot dashboard\nshould pop up automatically\nif it is not you can search it\non your system as iot dashboard\nand open it.\nSo now with the dashboard\nin our system,\nwe can start installing\nthe windows iot core\nonto our SD card.\nWe can do that by setting\nup a new device.\nLet's click on setup new device.\nSo once you do that,\nyou can see a few columns\nthat you will have to fill so\nthe first is device type.\nSo I'm using a Raspberry Pi 3.\nSo I'll choose Raspberry Pi 3.\nWhat?\nWas Bill do I want well,\nI want the Windows 10 iot core.\nSo I'll click on that\nwhich Drive is my SD card\non its on the F drive.\nThat's correct.\nAnd you can rename\nyour device from here.\nLet's say I'm gonna name it men\nwin RPI and you'll have\nto set a password for it.\nSo I'm going to go\nwith our PI 3 win\n10 have to repeat the same.\nOur PI 3 2010.\nSo now that the passwords are\nin place accept\nthe license agreement and click\non download and installed.\nSo I'll give you a pop-up\nabout erasing the SD card\nclick on continue.\nSo you downloading has now\nstarted so you might get\nanother pop-up which is\nthe iot utilities trying\nto install on your system,\npress yes, then you should get\na command line window\nwhere the OS will be flashed\nupon your SD card.\nSo with that done,\nwe finally have the operating\nsystem on our SD card.\nThere will be another prompt\nasking you to format disk.\nPlease hit cancel.\nThis is very important to not\nhit for my disc it on cancel.\nThat's it.\nIt says you guys\nd card is ready.\nSo go back to your mypcc.\nMake sure you eject\nyour SD card.\nOnce it is safe to remove\ntake it out and put it back\nin your Raspberry Pi.\nSo the next thing to do is\nto connect all your peripherals\nto your Raspberry Pi\nand power it on now\nmost operating systems\nwill require you to configure\nsome basic settings.\nWhen you put them up\nfor the first time\nsince the Windows 10 iot core is\nthe smallest version of Windows.\nIt almost has negligible\nsettings to be configured.\nIt will only ask you to set\nup your default language and\nif you want to connect\nto any Wi-Fi network,\nand that is it so now\nupon starting the pie.\nYou should see the windows logo.\nYou can see the welcome screen\nfor the Windows iot 10 code now\nsince it has been designed\nfor minimal and low-cost\ndevices the configuration\nupon the first boot\nhas also been kept minimal\nso that does it for finally\nbooted into the settings\nof the windows iot core.\nSo let us set the default\nlanguages English and hit next\nafter which it will ask you\nto connect to a Wi-Fi network.\nLet us say we will skip\nthis step and You\ncan also do it later\nfrom the home screen\nor the desktop.\nSo that's it.\nYou finally successfully\nbooted the windows iot core\nand it is ready for use.\nSo here we have Katana\nyou can record your voice\nfor better speech recognition.\nI'll skip this for now\nand let's say got it.\nSo this is your desktop\nfor the Windows 10 iot core you\ncan see there's device info\nwhich is mainly a home screen.\nIt tells you the IP\naddress and everything.\nThere's a command line window.\nThere's also a browser\nand there are tutorials\nfor you to make the most\nof the windows iot code.\nThis is settings button.\nThere's a power button\nas well other reason\nbehind your desktop\nbeing so minimal is\nthat the windows iot\nhas been designed\nto run both headed\nand headless applications\nso to develop applications,\nYou can do it on your laptop\nand then push it remotely it\nonto your Pi upon which the pie\nwill become their application.\nYou can use the visual\nstudio for it.\nSo now you can go back\nto your iot dashboard.\nNow the iot dashboard also\noffers some functionalities\nfor you to remotely\ncontrol your pie\nor your windows iot core.\nSo you can go to the my devices\non your dashboard and you\ncan see there's a Raspberry Pi\n3 with the name mean\nwhen RPI the name that\nwe gave it in the start now.\nFrom here, you can open it\nin device portal\nto our extended features.\nYou can launch\na command line window.\nYou can launch\niot Remote client.\nYou can shut it down.\nYou can restart it plus you\ncan add another pie to it.\nYou can also connect it\nto the Jour Cloud\nfor intelligent analysis\nand advanced cloud computing.\nAnd also there are\nthree packages which indirectly\nbe deployed to your Raspberry Pi\nso you basically\nwon't need Visual Studio.\nYou will not need much\nof coding you can directly\ndownload these packages\nand run them to die.\nThe power of Windows iot core.\nSo that's it.\nYou can see the settings offers\nsome basic preferences\nthis network in Wi-Fi.\nThis blue to this.\nKatana is a command line window.\nThere's an internet browser\nand there are other\ntutorials to make the most\nof Windows 10 iot core.\nSo that will be all\nI hope you followed\nhow to install the Windows\n10 iot code now looking\nat the rise in the Popularity\nof Internet of Things.\nI've come up with this tutorial\nto make sure you people pick\nor purchase the right\ndevelopment boards\nfor your iot projects.\nNow the adreno\nand the Raspberry Pi are you go\nto votes for all things iot,\nbut how are they any different\nand which one\nshould you be using?\nWell, don't worry by the end\nof this session.\nYou could be educating\nyour friends on the same.\nBut before we begin though,\nlet me quickly tell you\nwhat exactly I'll be covering\nin today's session.\nSo for those of you\nthat are still confused\non what these devices are.\nI'll briefly talk about\nthese integrated circuit board.\nOdes then we\ncompare their hardware\nand software specifications\nunderstand their modes\nof operation check out\nthere available boards\nand finally conclude\nwith the purpose\nthat each of these boats\nhave been designed\nfor so without putting\nit off any further.\nLet's get started.\nThe computers were\na breakthrough in the world\nof machines making\nthe operation of any device\nor machine smarter than ever\nand the motherboard\nin a computer is\nwhat drove these operations\neither performing\nlogical instructions\nthat have been fed to them\nor calculating outcomes based\non the information.\nThey receive these\nmotherboards LED all parts\nof the computer communicate\nand act by utilizing the CPU\nand the memory in fact\nany peripheral connecting\nto the computer also\nneeds to connect\nto the motherboards\nprogrammable input/output.\nActors for their operation\nnow these motherboards\nare integrated circuits\nand with the world trying\nto minimize the size of devices\nand make them more portable.\nWe now have a variety of\nsimilarly capable circuit boards\navailable to help us build\nsmart equipment of our choice\nand according to our needs.\nOnly smartest development\nboards today zero down\nto the Raspberry Pi\nand the Arduino\nboth these integrated\ncircuit boards might have\na few things in common,\nbut differ majorly\nin the mode of operation\nand capabilities and\nif you've been experimenting\nwith the embedded systems,\nor if the onset\nof iot has got you playing with\nthese integrated circuit boards,\nthen you must understand\nthe key differences\nbetween them and know the one\nthat will be more suitable\nfor your iot projects.\nSo let me Begin by telling you\nthat the Arduino is based\non a microcontroller\nand is mostly designed.\nTo control the electrical\ncomponents connected\nto the circuit board\nin any system.\nWhereas the Raspberry Pi\nis based on a microprocessor\nthat computes data and produces\nvaluable outputs and\nif required it controls\nthe electrical components\nand it's system based on\nthe outcome of its computation.\nSo basically the Raspberry Pi\nis a single-board computer\nwith the Arduino is just\na single-board microcontroller.\nSo let us start\nwith the comparison\nby learning more\nabout the hardware\nand software specifications\nof the latest models\nof both these devices.\nNow the Arduino boards\nhave a very simple hardware and\nsoftware structure the Arduino,\nyou know runs\non an 8-bit AVR atmega328\nmicrocontroller on a chip,\nwhich has a ram of two kilobytes\nupon an eeprom flash memory\nof 32 kilobytes\nand clocks are processing speed\nof 16 megahertz on the contrary\nthe Raspberry Pi boards\nhave a complex.\nLecture of hardware\nand software the\nRaspberry Pi 3 B\nplus comes with a powerful\nbroadcom BCM to a37 b0\nmicroprocessor on a chip as\nits Central Processing Unit,\nwhich runs on a 64-bit\nquad-core processor called\nthe a arm cortex a53\nfeaturing a static Ram\nof 1GB running directly\nupon the SD card storage\nat a clock speed\nof one point four gigahertz.\nNow this microchip also acts\nas the graphics processing unit\nwith the broadcom video\ncode for integrated\ngraphics card building.\nIt for low-power multimedia\nprocessing now such\na multi utility microchip\nis being called a Soc\nor a system-on-a-chip these days\nand besides the processor\nand the graphics card.\nThey also house other\nmicrocontrollers to control\nthe electrical components.\nSo there's plenty\nof power packed into it.\nEven for many add-ons\nor USB connections.\nNow most of the other Hardware,\nuh, pretty much the same\nfor both these devices\nlike timers voltage\nRegulators serial,\nperipheral interface bus has\ninto integrated circuit serial,\nyou are and I/O pins, okay.\nConnectors but again,\nthe I/O connectors\nin Arduino are more capable\nthan the I/O pins\nin the Raspberry Pi\nwhich must depend on transistors\nto drive external hardware.\nI'll be Raspberry Pi is still\nbetter logical processing\nwhich means it can compute even\ncomplex mathematical operations\nenabling it to process\nand support audios videos images\nand other gu eyes.\nSo it's more like a computer\nin contrast to the Arduino\nwhich can only control\npath The device and would need\nadditional circuit software\nand communication buses\nto run audio video\nor any visual graphic at all.\nPlus the pie also\noffers HDMI support.\nSo all that you need\nis just a screen\nor any display device removing\nthe need for connecting it\nto a computer all the time\nlike the Arduino now this is\nbecause the Arduino comes\nwithout any operating software\nthe only real software it has is\nfor compiling code\nto Machine level\nand allowing serial connection\nfor data transfer.\nThis is also why\nit requires less power\nand could even get faster\nas it only needs\nto compile code and use\nthe chip directly\nto control any component.\nWhereas the Raspberry Pi\nmust enable all required\nlayers of software\nand utilize different programs\nto make any task\nhappen then again,\nit is also why the Pike\nin multitask doing a variety\nof tasks at a time\nwhile the Arduino can perform\nany single task multiple times.\nSo the Arduino offers\nan ID with the compiler\nand is the only one\nthat this device supports\nwhich means only the codes\nwritten here will work\nand get compiled\non to its physical board\nthis He uses basic C\nand C++ paradigms and breaks\ndown all its functions\ninto accessible packages\nmaking it quite easy to learn\nand operate however\nwith the Raspberry Pi\nwhich supports multiple\nprogramming languages\nand software environments.\nYou need to be proficient\nat coding to get\nthe most out of it.\nAlso the pie now\ncomes with Bluetooth\nand Wi-Fi support\nfor remote connections.\nIn fact, its latest model\nfeatures faster Ethernet\nor dual band of 2.4 gigahertz\nand 5 gigahertz wireless,\nLAN and an embedded web server\nwhile the we know features\nBluetooth on just one\nof its boards all the Arduino BT\nand will require\nadditional circuit\nfor communication over\nwireless networks or ethernet.\nNow these additional circuits\nfor the Arduino\nor called Shields\nand are attached to it\nfor extended functionalities\nsimilarly in the case\nof the Raspberry Pi\nthese extended circuits\nare called hats both are plenty\nof available housing\ndiverse functionalities\nsensors Motors actuators\nand software on them\nfor interacting with\nthe physical world\nand driving external hardware\naccording to It's\nhost devices capabilities.\nOkay.\nNow I can see\nsomebody has a question.\nSo Debbie wants to know\nwhat is the most\npopular programming language\nthat is used for coding\nwith the Raspberry Pi.\nSo since the Raspberry Pi is\nessentially a computer\nyou can actually run\ncode on it in almost\nall programming languages.\nBut the most popular one\nin my opinion would be python\nas even the pies official\noperating system comes\nwith the default python ideally,\nwhich is the IDE for python.\nSo I hope that clears you doubt\nif there is Any more questions,\nplease keep it coming.\nOkay.\nMeanwhile, I mean move on.\nSo let me now tell you\nhow you can identify the purpose\nbehind using either an Arduino\nor Raspberry Pi.\nSo the Arduino being more\nof a microcontroller motherboard\nis best suited for\nrepetitive tasks like reading\nand Reporting temperature\nopening and closing\nof doors controlling lights\nor building motion\ndetecting alarms.\nIt also works great\nfor creating quick\nand lightweight prototypes,\nbut the Raspberry Pi is more\nlike a general purpose computer\nand is good at complex.\nRelations or performing\nmultiple tasks or processing\na large amount of data.\nSo if you need\na full-fledged computer\non a very small scale the pie is\nwhat you should be looking at.\nSo let us now move on\nto the different boards\nthat both have had over time\nand look at some\nof its prominent ones.\nSo the Arduino has been around\nfor quite a while now\nand has had multiple\nboards over the years\nwith different functionalities.\nAlthough the Arduino, you know,\nthe Arduino Mega they\nDo you know lily pad\nand the Arduino Bluetooth\nhave been the more popular ones?\nSimilarly?\nThe Raspberry Pi\ndespite being relatively new is\non its third generation\nwith each of its models\nbetter than the previous ones\nthe Raspberry Pi 3,\nB+ is its latest and most\npowerful development board\nyet in the session.\nWe'll be talking\nabout the top seven projects\nwhich are outstanding\nthemselves in the Internet\nof Things domain now,\nlet's talk about Each\nof these projects.\nLet's start with number 7,\nwhich is a biometric system.\nNow a biometric\nsystem is something\nthat we always encounter\non our daily basis as\nwell because we always\neither use a fingerprint sensor\nor we use an iris scanning.\nSo it depends from\norganization to organization.\nBut how does this actually\nwork the system there?\nLet's take in case\nof this example has\na fingerprint scanner.\nNow the first time that I\nam presenting my fingerprint,\nit scans the fingerprint\nand considers this as\npart of an enrollment.\nUs from this fingerprint\ntemplate what it does is\nthat it extract\ncertain key features,\nwhich makes it different\nfrom others and stores it\ninto a database from then\nforward every time\nthat I place my finger on top\nof this fingerprint scanner.\nIt creates a template\nand Compares this\nwith all the templates\nthat's present in the database\nif it matches\nthen correspondingly,\nlet's it gives me an attendance\nor lets me access at or\nif it does not then\nit raises an alert\nwith respect to that same now.\nThis is just a foundation now\nas I said this biometric\nsystem Fingerprint,\nit can be is scanning\nor it can be a combination\nof both as well as\nvoice recognition system is one\nof the key products\nin the biometric domain next.\nWe have Smart irrigation system.\nNow I am someone\nwho personally likes\ngardening a lot.\nNow, this is something\nthat would really\nmake my life easier\nbecause usually what I do is\nthat on Sundays I spent\nabout two hours just\nwatering and looking\nafter my plants through\na smart irrigation system.\nWhat it does is\nthat it checks the moisture\npresent in the environment or in\nthe water lanes that I\nhave created now to help.\nYou understand how it works.\nUsually there are two main\nInternet of Things devices\nthat are used here,\nwhich is the Arduino board\nand the Raspberry Pi\nyour Raspberry Pi becomes\nthe main processing unit.\nAnd I place an Arduino board\nfor each of my water channels.\nThese addressing modes\nthemselves are connected\nto multiple sensors\nwhich are part\nof this water channel.\nSo what these sensors do is\nthat we check the moisture\npresent in these lanes\nare such so let's say\na specifically in\ndoes not meet the minimum\nrequired moisture then\nwhat it would do is\nthat it will Send a signal to\nthe Raspberry Pi again.\nAll these devices\nare connected on the same\nwireless router Network\nand the Raspberry Pi\nwould identify the lack\nof moisture and pass\nthe signal to the relay.\nThe relay in turn\nwould initiate the water pump\nand water would be pumped now\nin order to ensure\nthat water is not wasted we\nwould create gate controls\nand only the gate\nwhere the moisture is less.\nWould the gate be open\nonce my sensor detects\nthat the moisture level has gone\nbeyond my required\nlevel it would\nAgainst another signal\nto the Raspberry Pi asking\nit to stop the pump as well.\nSo this in turn helps you\nto save a lot of water\nand also makes your life\nquite easier as well.\nSo after this your only task\nin your garden would be is\neither setting up new plans\nor creating new water channels\nas such the next project\nin our list is a security camera\nand door unlock system.\nNow, this is something\nthat's quite interesting\nand I have personally\ntried this out\nand it's really something\nthat you should try\nout as well here.\nWhat happens is\nthat you place a camera\non top 40 Which in turn\nclicks the photo of a person\nwho comes into the frame now,\nthis photo is again sent\nto an analytical system\nwhich in turn Compares this\nwith all the photos\nthat it possesses\nin order to identify\nwhether to let the user open\nthe door or not now\nand evolution to this is\nthat if it does not find\nthe photo of that person it\ncan notify the concerned person\nthat so-and-so person\nis trying to access this dough.\nWould you like to\nauthorize this person\nand address information\nto the database or would you?\nI'd like to deny the access\nto this person as well.\nUsually this is used in areas\nwhere you have high\nsensitive information stored\nin order to maintain\na strict control to the access\nto this information\nas well another usage\nof the security camera\nand door unlock system\ncan be even at our homes\nwhen we can identify\nwho's come at our home\nwhen you're not there\nand either decide to give them\naccess to our homes or not.\nNow the next thing is something\nthat we all really\ndecide to have\nwhich is a smart home system\na smart home system\ncan be something\nthat really makes.\nLife quite easy starting\nfrom energy management\nwhere the light control system\nis the AC the appliances\nthat we use the thermostat\nall this is managed\nin short trying to cut\ndown the power consumption\nthat's taking place\nby door management system\nis also part of this.\nMy security system is also part\nof this my water management\nsystem again becomes a part\nof this as well.\nAgain, these are key things\nthat really stands out\nin the smart home system.\nBut again, what I\nwould personally recommend is\nthat a Smart Homes\nlimitations is where\nour imagination stops anything\nthat you wish to automate\nor make wish to make\nyour life easier can be part\nof a smart phone system as well.\nNow a smart home usually\nis going to be a base\nfor our next project\nwhich is a smart City\na smart city is an evolution\nof a smart home here.\nIt's not just the sensors\nof a single home\nthat is connected here.\nIt's correlation or a network\nor a connection\nbetween various organizations\nvarious domains as well\nas various segments\nof that city as a whole\nas such Judo the life\nof every single dependent person\nin that City becomes easier\nas a whole as well\nand in turn will really\nhelp develop that City\nto Greater extent such now\nthe key factor here\nfor a smart city is\na government support as well.\nAnd if governments are\nreally willing to take this step\nthen I hope we would see\na smart City completely built\non internet of things maybe\nthe next 5 to 10 years as well.\nNow the next\nproject is something\nthat really stands out\non a personal level this this\nis Zelda Ocarina controlled\nhome automation system.\nThis is personally something\nthat I feel is the closest\nto a smart home system\nwhere most of the elements\nof the home is completely\ncontrolled by an Ocarina\nwhat Alan pan has done here is\nthat he's created\na node-based recognition system,\nwhich completely automates\nhis hope but rather\nthan telling more about this.\nLet's just look at a quick video\nwhich will give you a glimpse\ninto how he has done this\nand what has he done.\n7:27 p.m.\nNext on our list at number one.\nIf you've not already guessed\nis Jarvis Jarvis is the\nartificial intelligence system\nthat Facebook's creator\nMark second Berg has built\nfor his home automated system.\nI'm quite sure you've\nalready seen the video\nof Mars are kannberg interacting\nwith Jarvis which has\nMorgan Freeman's voice.\nAnd if you've not,\nhere's a quick glimpse\ninto the same.\nGood morning, Jarvis.\nGood morning Mark.\nIt's Saturday.\nSo you only have five meetings\nroom temperature is set\nto a cool 68 degrees\nearlier this year.\nI started building a simple AI\nto help run our home.\nI talked to Jarvis\nusing this app.\nI built it uses artificial\nintelligence to understand me\nand figure out what to do\nMax woke up a few minutes ago.\nI'm entertaining her.\nAll right.\nLet's go check on her.\nGood morning.\nLet's practice our man.\nZhao Xiang Hao Jarvis\nyour Mandarin is so soothing\nshe she Jarvis also helps\nme get ready in the morning\nfresh shirt Byron home.\nHell yeah,\nJarvis knows when to\nmake me breakfast.\nYour toast is ready.\nAll right, it's time\nfor my call with shrap.\nCan you get him\non the video conference line\nsetting up the BC room.\nNow remember to check on the AI\nguidance system for tequila.\nOne of the best things about\nJarvis is it could recognize\npeople at the gate let\nthem in automatically\nand then just tell me about it\nMark your parents are coming in.\nThanks Geoffrey.\nIt's Jarvis and Jarvis can play\nall of our favorite music.\nHey play some good.\nGo back songs.\nI'm sorry Mark.\nI'm afraid I can't do that.\nThere are no good\nNickelback song Good\nthat was actually a test.\nOkay.\nHow about just play some songs\nthat are whole\nfamily likes what?\nI'm a dad.\nNow.\nThis is what I listen to.\nNo, what you need\nto understand here is\nthat internet of things\nis not something\nthat's just dependent\non a sensor or a few sensors,\nwhich is connected\nto a Raspberry Pi on adreno put\nwhen I look at the entire\narchitecture of iot.\nThis is a complete ecosystem\nwhere in my sensors\ngather information,\nwhich is again stored\non a platform\nand then processed on this now\nif there have been\nany issues or failures\nthat have been reported\nby these sensors,\nthen I need to create\nactionable items.\nIn order to ensure\nthat this is never\nreally repeated again,\nbut the information\nwants to spin process\nthe process data is then passed\ninto machine learning\nand artificial intelligence\nin order to understand analyze\nand identify various patterns\nthat's out there and help\npass this information\non back to the sensor\nthis in turn helps.\nYou have a better experience\nand also improve the system\nas a whole a system\nwhere I come home every day\nat 8:30 start off\nmy Casey wait 15 minutes\nfor it to cool down is\na tedious process.\nBut it's a today my Internet\nof Things platform identifies\nthis pattern already switches\non the AC at 8:15.\nThen I just need to come home\nand I can relax right away.\nThis is just one\nof the key examples\nof one of the key ideas\nthat's out there today\nand the limitation here again\nis just your imagination.\nIt is so good to see\nthat so many of you\nare keeping up with the trends.\nOf technology today.\nSo let us dig deeper\ninto these devices\nthat Mark the beginning\nof every iot ecosystem\nand look at the best ones in use\ntoday in different domains.\nBut before we start\ndon't let me quickly run you\nalong the outlines\nof today's session\nso that you have\na clear idea on the topics\nthat I'd be covering.\nSo first I'll be telling you\nhow you can identify any object\nto be an iot device.\nThen I'll tell you what they\ncan do for you and cite some\nof the major use cases on it\nand then I'll tell you\nhow iot devices are shipping\nthe entire world\nand code some leading examples\nand then I'll tell you\nhow secure is.\nThe device in iot and finally,\nI'll be telling you all\nthe important things\nthat you need to know\nto build an iot device.\nSo without putting\nit off any further,\nlet us begin our session today.\nNow these devices\nthat play the role\nof things in iot are\nwhat make the smartest\nsystems possible today be\njust a smart Appliance\nor an entire Smart City.\nIt could be complete\nComputing devices designed\nkeeping the portability in mind\nor tiny electronic\ncomponents operating\non minimal device software\nfor data transfer\nand Activity without\nany Computing abilities at all\nand there are also objects\nthat are not made up of\nany electronic Hardware at all\nand can still become\nthe things in iot by having\nthese smart things attached\nto them in summer the other way.\nSo what I'm basically saying is\nthat even we humans\ncan become a thing\nin the internet of things.\nBut again,\nthat is a contextual top\nand you'll understand why\nas we move on with\nthe session today.\nSo for now we can just say\nthat any device however puny\nor powerless with\nthe ability to receive\nor send data allowing\nit to communicate\nover networks can be called\na thing or an iot.\nIce also, it should be serving\na purpose like either collecting\nsome information or\ndelivering some outcome.\nNow that is the least\nany iot enabled device\nor thing in iot\nwill require today,\neven though the bigger devices\nhave diverse features\nand can be more powerful.\nIt is a miniaturizing\nof computer hardware\nthat has truly given\nthe Internet of Things its Edge\nin the market today.\nIt is made it possible\nfor these iot devices to even\nfunction and microscopic levels\nin the remotest corners\nof our world.\nAnd as also Borden focus\non more Target oriented features\nspecific to their goals,\nPlus with devices running\non incredibly low power levels\nand operating with\nsuch minimal resources.\nThe things in iot come\nwith the promise\nof implementing Solutions\nin the most cost effective way\npossible without compromising\non the system's accuracy.\nThis is because at the smallest\nlevels these things are embedded\nwith just enough technology\nfor them to communicate\nover the internet\nand other networks to get\nthe data analyzed stored\nand processed over that Network\nor over the cloud rather\nthan physically housing.\nAll those Technologies\non themselves.\nAlso such low power levels\nare perfect for the lead.\nOur chips sensors\nand other low energy components\nthat is devices used\nfor the operation.\nBut like I said,\nthere are substantial equipped\nto connect wirelessly for\nexchanging data and Performing\nactions based on them.\nAlso such low energy modes\nof connectivity make it easy\nfor these things to operate\njust about anywhere\nwhile letting us control\nand monitor them remotely\nfor almost any part\nof the world.\nSo it is as if the British\ntechnology Pioneer Kevin Ashton\nwho coined the phrase internet\nof things back in the 1999\nsomehow knew of these potentials\nthat I would have brings out.\nDevices today so\nlet us move on now.\nLet us see what things\ncan do for you.\nSo one of the most popular\nimplementation of these things\nand their applications\nhave been in the sector\nof home automation today,\nthe use of Internet\nof Things in this industry\nhas got the world closer\nto achieving a dream home\npowered by the smartest systems\nusing these iot devices\nand these systems\nhave been built such\nthat all its devices\ncan intercommunicate to allow\nowners a customized access.\nTo all aspects of your home\nlike your lights your logs\nor the inside environment\nor security cameras\nor even your total energy\nconsumption with the brand\nspecific IOD platforms\nand clouds behind them.\nThese iot devices are\nnow capable of exhibiting\nambient intelligence\nand also stay connected\nto the internet for driving\nreal-time operations.\nSo let us get into some examples\nof iot devices used\nin most Smart Homes today,\nand we must begin with the\ntunable smart Lighting systems\nlike Philips Hue\nsmart home lighting\nor the tp-link.\nColor Smart Wi-Fi\nthat can be easily controlled\nusing your smart phones\nwith the option\nof creating custom\nlighting automations\nfrom anywhere in the world\nby just being connected\nto the internet\nwith smart lights\nlike these you could turn\nthem on or off anytime\nand tune the color\nand the brightness of Lights\nin your home's remotely\nno matter wherever\nyou are moving on.\nDid you know that locks\nand keys are getting\nold fashion nowadays.\nIt's not a joke.\nSmart locks are a part\nof almost every smart home today\nand the August smartlock\nthird generation is one\nof the newest and the phones\non the market today.\nWhat makes it Stand Out\nAmong its peers is\nthat it comes\nwith bluetooth support\nso that you won't need to worry,\neven if your internet is down\nsomehow with a device like this\nthat attaches to your existing\nthat bolts you will always know\nif your door is\ncompletely closed and locked\nwith its doors and Technology.\nIt'll even remind you\nto lock your doors\nwhen you leaving or tell you\nif they were properly closed\nor not based on the location\nof your phone,\nyou can even create\nsecure virtual or temporary keys\nfor your neighbors\nand guess just in case now\nthe next iot device is Nest\nlearning thermostat it is one\nof the best examples\nof an iot device today as a part\nof your home automation system\nthis intelligent device\nLawns your schedules\nand preferences over\nthe first couple of weeks too\nsmart in the cooling\nand heating systems in your home\nand then regulate\nyour home temperature\nautomatically to save\nelectricity by 20%\namong a ton of other features.\nSo to reduce your energy bills,\nit uses sensors\nand your phone's location\nto realize the whether the time\nor the environment inside\nand when nobody's home it\nwill shift into energy saving.\nMode apart from the\nthermostat Nest also\nprovide smart cameras with smoke\nand carbon monoxide alarms\nto better manage\nyour home's atmosphere\nand Security Plus it\nlets you manage\nand monitor each of them\nthrough its dedicated app\nor even build your own\nRevenue channels upon them.\nThere is also one more device\nthat I think is worth\nthe mention in the home\nautomation systems of today.\nIt's mostly just a doorbell\nfor your front doors.\nOnly a lot smarter\nthe video dogus\nby ring is a modest name\nfor all the things\nthat it can do.\nIt's like Always home\nas it lets you answer\nyour door from just about\nanywhere it will in fact,\neven a lot you of motion\nwithin 30 feet of your door\nand stream its live footage\nonto your phone.\nAnd if somebody rings\na bell you can let them know\nthat you're not home\nand even have a word with them\nwith its right Vision\nthe wide-angle high-definition\nrecordings get simultaneously\nsaved were Cloud\nfor your use anytime.\nNow before I tell you\nwhat else iot devices can do for\nyou virtual or home assistance\nlike the Amazon Alexa\nthe Google Assistant Siri\nand Jibo are also attending\napplication of the internet\nof things and have made it big\nin the home automation\nsystems of today.\nNow, other than making\nyour Home Smart iot devices are\nalso capable of intelligent Lee\ntracking your health and fitness\nand as far as Fitness\ngoes the Fitbit tracker\nor the Apple watch\nand other such smart watches\nhave been a revolutionary\nsuccess and along\nwith your Fitness aspects.\nThey also solve your day\nto day Health Care needs\nlike checking your heart rate\nand perspiration levels\nand tracking your body\ntemperature to predict a cold\nor a flu on the Are you\nwill be amazed to know\nhow the other iot devices\nare saving more lives\nand making Health Care better\nlike the Philips Healthcare is\nmedication dispensing service\nor the hero smart pills\ndispenser are the most\nsuccessful use cases today\nand exemplify the potential\nof iot in the healthcare sector.\nIt is the perfect reminder\nfor your medications\nand is a convenient measure\nfor the elderly\nand the sick alike\nwith the option to remotely\nmanage it with your smartphone.\nYou could also\nmonitor the medication\nof your near and dear ones\nand be notified upon running low\non any Medication at all\nplus you could also get info\non the right medication\nfor common health hazards.\nAnd now with\nhow integral smart phones\nand internet have become\nin our lives Health\nand Fitness Solutions\nusing iot will only\nget more and more prominent\nin the recent years to come.\nSo apart from\nthe personal benefits\nthat you can get as a consumer\nor user iot also aims to impact\nthe greater good the talk\nof smart cities\nis prevalent these days\nwhere the waste management\nsystem is more efficient.\nYou shall in the environment\nis checked and even\nthe outdoor lighting\nand traffic signals are equipped\nwith motion sensors\nto ensure energy conservation\nby turning on only\nupon detecting traffic updates\nand its route\nor upon sensing pedestrians\nand Vehicles nearby.\nNow, let us look at some\nof the other sectors of service\nand Civic amenities\nthat these iot devices are\npowering to up the efficiencies\nof our world today.\nOne of the most visible\nSmart Systems in place is\nin the domain of transport\nand Automotive today\nand along with more and more\nconnected car platforms\ntoday there has Also\nbeen a lot of hype\naround smart and self-driving\nVehicles hitting the lines\nof Transport very\nsoon plus with the maps\nproviding real-time Intel\nand the modern vehicles housing\nnumerous sensors in them.\nYou could always tell\nwhich way to go or\nwhat parts need to be looked at.\nLike say tracking the Fulton's\noption altitude and maintenance\nissues of flights\nin real time without waiting\nfor it to land every time\ncan help in anticipating\nproblems to schedule maintenance\nprior to its arrival.\nSo that deal is\nand mishaps are minimized\nin the aviation industry\nanother major area\nof Application for\niot devices isn't the field\nof Agriculture or sector\nthat is often neglected.\nDespite.\nIts utmost importance can now\nbe brought up to speed\nwith iot with several cheap\nand minimal sensors\nthat monitor the best climate\nand soil quality\nfor the right kind of crops\nor other smart devices\nthat ensure the efficiency\nof automated irrigation systems,\neven the gardens in your home\nor the trees in smart cities\nor even the plant life\nand vegetation in agroforestry\nor wildlife habitats\ncould be kept in check the most\nInnovative iot devices\nto they include the smart\nwatering system Blossom,\nwhich can create\noptimal wanting she Duels\nfor all the plants in your home\nbased on real-time weather data\nand forecasts and will regulate\nall your sprinkles accordingly\nand allows you complete control\nover them through Bluetooth\nor the internet\nand also the clean grows\ncarbon nanotube probe is one of\nthe best iot devices for farmers\nand gardeners all\naround the world today with\nsensors to monitor the intake\nof nutrients in the crops to\nbetter manage farming resources\nand improve the quality\nof their fields farmers\ncan now order Maturity rate\nand the color of props\nfor better yields and faster.\nIt's a production now.\nIt might be a little ironical\nof me to talk about one\nof the very first Industries\nto be made smart\non such a late note\nin today's session,\nbut I really just wanted\nto save the best for last\nand believe me the sector\nof retail and Logistics is\nwhere the internal things\npromises the most\nastounding results\nwith iot devices already\nbeing extensively used\nin shopping restaurants\nhospitality industries\nand many other\nbusinesses to control\nthe supply chain effectively.\nAnd obtain valuable\ninsights based on them\nand manage their logical\nor merchandising expenses\nin the best possible ways.\nNow the Q hop is one\nof the leading examples\nof internal things being used\nin the retail today typically\ndesigned to bring in\nseamless autonomous check\nout Technologies to\nall retail verticals\nby digitizing the checkouts\nthrough RFID tags\nthat only unlock\nafter its payment is processed.\nThe sole purpose\nbehind it was to allow users\nto sell check out in stores.\nAlthough it is mainly used\nfor security reasons today\nto inhibit Petty thefts.\nDoors, but guess what that was\nbefore the Inception\nof Amazon go earlier this year.\nNow the technology\ninside this convenience store\nwill really seem\nlike it was pulled out\nfrom the future somewhere.\nAlthough it is so new\nthat there are\nonly three locations\nwith this feature\nhas six toes so far.\nSo operate and are managed by\nthe online retailer Amazon.\nThese stores can give\nyou a shopping experience\nunlike any you've ever\nhad before with the idea\nessentially being grab-and-go.\nThese stores will just\nneed your Amazon go apps\nfor you to enter\nand then employees.\nEurovision machine learning\nand Sensor Fusion\nto automatically add items\nthat you pick instantly on\nto your virtual card\nwill also remove them\nof just as promptly if you\nkeep them back now\nonce you've grabbed\nall the things\non your shopping list and are\nready to exit all you need to do\nis just walk right\nout of the store.\nYes, no more lining up\nin busy cues of the usually\nlimited checkout counters to\nwait your turn for the purchase.\nYou can exit the store\nwithout even having\nto pull out any cash\nor a card and you will find\nthe amount for all the things\nthat Walk out with the beaded\nsimultaneously from the balance\nin your Amazon account such\na smart system could also check\nthe inventory regularly\nto notify retailers\non the need for restocking\nand even helps to manage\nthe supply chain\nand a better way.\nNow, there are also other\npromising areas in logistic\nthat iot devices have started\nto unpack like in the case\nof shipping cargo or Fleet\nManagement smart Bluetooth.\nLow energy tags are attached\nto the items being moved\nfor remotely tracking the exact\nlocations speed of transport\nand storage conditions.\nFor instance.\nThe things dot IO is\na simple iot platform\nthat provides a dedicated\ncloud-based dashboard\nfor better Logistics\nby enabling access to real-time\nand reliable inputs from it's\nconnected smart sensors\nand paired location trackers\nirrespective of wherever\nthey might be so\nalthough use cases\nand the respective\niot devices are things.\nWe just went over\nour only a select few\nof the countless applications\nof the internet of things\nthat can drive almost\nany sector today\nand these iot devices\ncould be things themselves\nor even attached to someone\nor something to make\nit a thing in iot.\nLike even a person\nwith a heart rate monitor\ncould be a thing in iot\nas it collects\nand provides information\nthat can act as inputs\nto other Smart Systems\nto operate on so the Baseline\nfor anything to become\nan iot device could be laid\nout as any object\nwith a unique IP address\nfor communication over networks\nand the ability to gather\nand transmit data\nor receive data\nand perform tasks based on it\nand the Ameri technology\nin these devices are\nwhat interact with\neither the internal States\nor the external environment.\nTo capture all data\nand drive decisions\nmade up on them.\nNow with the internet\nof things being such\na large community of different\ndevices the challenges\nof iot devices mainly start with\ncommunication as the protocols\nand languages used\nby each of them vary.\nHugely due to the lack\nof common standards\nfor all of them yet\nand this lack of a uniform\nand secure standard\nacross all iot devices,\nwhich is great security risks\nmaking them highly unreliable\nfor most important.\nMissions are into\noperations today.\nAlso without customers\nbeing assured of the privacy\nand security of the data.\nThere is just no reason\nfor them to risk using\nor adopting such\ninsecure Solutions.\nDo you really understand\nwhat the role of security\nand iot devices is today.\nWell, let me tell you\nabout a major Cyber attack\nthat happened back in October of\n2016 a large distributed denial\nof service attack dubbed\nMirai affected DNS servers\non the east coast\nof the United States\nwhich disrupted Services\nall across the world\nupon further investigations.\nThis issue was tracked\nback to the hackers\nthat infiltrated smart networks\nthrough the iot devices\nbeing used in them\nlike the routers or the camera.\nSo that brings\nabout the situation.\nWe're in our devices and data\nare all remotely connected\nand stowed upon these networks\nand its security\ngets compromised.\nWe might even not know it\nover the first few days or weeks\nand it might be just\ntoo late by the time we\ndo realize now the way in\nfor these hackers were\nundoubtedly a result\nof poor practice at some end\nlike say the use of default\npasswords rather than changing.\nHence, the adoption\nof better practices\nand the reinforcement\nof proper authentication\nNetwork segmentations encryption\nand cryptography can\nstill make the things\nand its systems\nquite secure given\nthat we start making sure\nof building them up securely\nfrom our end as well\nplus the issue of overall\nconnectivity is also a feat\nthat our world is still\ndriving to achieve\nbut hasn't been able\nto accomplish it.\nThat brings us\nto the last topic for today.\nSo let me tell you\nthe important things\nthat you should know\nto build an iot device.\nSo building an iot product\nor device or solution\nmust be done thinking\nabout the relevant purposes\nthat it can serve\nand the ways in which they\ncan be prepared to work\nfor at least the next couple\nof decades along with the option\nand space for\nquick improvisations\nand upgrades and just\nlike we saw in all\nour examples today.\nYou must have understood\nthe two important categories\nthat iot devices\nare mainly made up\nof the first is the hardware\nas And the underlying room\nis to aggregate the hardware\nin the most minimal way.\nYou can without compromising\non the primary features\nthat you want\nyour device to use.\nNow.\nThese features are mostly due\nto Bluetooth low energy sensors\nor beacons connected\nto the internet\nor a customized product with\nprobably a combination of these\non a circuit board made up\nof a semiconductor like Silicon\nand may also house\nor the components\nlike transistors resistors\nreceivers transmitters actuators\nand integrated circuit\nor a microchip.\nSo the most devices\nlike a smartphone\nor a result of such combinations\non a little more complex level\nwith proper casing\nand with the second\nmost important aspect\nof these devices.\nSo the second important category\nin iot devices is\nthe software aspect\non the device level the size\nof your software will depend\non how minimal\nor bulky your device is.\nAnd what are the components\nthat your housing on it\non the most basic note.\nThe device software\nonly needs to be enough\nfor handling the operation\nof your device driving\ncomponents to collect data\nand converting them\ninto transmitters.\nFun connecting two networks\ndriving the transmitter to send\ndata and the receiver to receive\ndata to and from the network\nand converting it to the machine\nunderstandable form for driving\ncomponents to perform\nsome task or display.\nSome outcomes based\non the received instructions.\nNow all this will require\nvery minimal software\nunlike the software\non your phones\nthat come with entire\nmobile operating systems\nall the other important\nsoftware for intelligence\nand smartness in these devices\nwould be provided by the\nunderlying Cloud infrastructure\nand even by the Mobile apps\nor web dashboards.\nThe software aspect\nof iot devices is in fact\nwhat controls the hardware\naspects to sense\nsome information or\nperform an instruction\nwhile both aspects are the most\nintegral parts of an iot device.\nYou might also need\nto overcome a few more hurdles\nbefore you iot device\nis truly ready\nto implement smart Solutions\nand Power Smart Systems\nof our world today.\nThese hurdles could\nbe connectivity issues\nor compatibility problems or\nsecurity and privacy concerns,\nbut don't let\nthe obstacles dishearten you\nin Just consult people\nwith knowledge on the same.\nWhile the Internet of Things\nequips a multitude of domains\nand millions of devices\nwith connectivity every day.\nThere are still a few domains,\nwhich I find a tad\nmore interesting than the others\nand they are iot in everyday\nlives iot in healthcare\nin smart cities agriculture\nIndustrial Automation\nand finally in\ndisaster management\nfirst, we have Internet\nof things in our daily lives.\nThis is probably a Hallmark\nin the iot industry\nas it's also One\nof the first industry is\nto deploy iot at its service.\nSo let me give you an example of\nhow iot can service\nin our daily lives\nconsider a home appliance\nsuch as your AC currently,\nwhat you do is\nthat you go home you\nturn on your AC and wait\nfor it to reach a temperature\nthat you like say about\n25 degrees Celsius.\nSo does anybody\nsee a problem here?\nNo one that's probably\nbecause there isn't\na problem here.\nThis is a perfectly\nfunctional setting.\nBut what if it could be better\nwhat if when your car\nwas five minutes away\nyour AC received a message.\nWhat if it was\nconnected to a cloud\nwhich had a dashboard containing\nall the relevant information\nlike the location of your car\nthe outside temperature\nand the temperature\nat which you liked your room\nyour AC could then turn on\nbefore you arrived\nand create an Ambience\nthat you like?\nWouldn't that be something?\nWell, you can remove\nall the waters\nfrom the previous scenario\nas this no longer.\nMust just be a figment\nof your imagination.\nThanks to the internet of things\niot can connect your fitbit's\nto your vehicles\nfrom your smart phones\nto your in-flight services from\nhome appliances like your ACS\nto whole entire cities.\nMaybe this is\nwhat Kevin Ashton meant\nwhen he spoke of this concept\nwhere every area sensor man\nand machine could be connected\nto one another.\nSo I hope you all are\nwith me till here.\nSo next we have\niot in healthcare.\nI'm sure most of you have heard\nabout the Smart Medicine\ndispensers by now\nas the name suggests.\nIt's basically a smart appliance\nthat stores dispenses and\nmanages your medicines for you.\nNow.\nThis is a very small piece\nof a very big picture\nthe health care\nand the general practice\nof medicine majorly\nfaces issues in one\nor more of these three things.\nWe have your research\ndevices and care.\nMedical research has to rely\nupon leftover data\nin control settings\nfor medical examination.\nIt lacks real world data,\nwhich can solve\ncritical conditions iot\ncould be the answer to all\nthese problems The Internet\nof Things opens ways\nto a sea of valuable\ndata through analysis\nand real-time testing Internet\nof Things empowers\nHealthcare professionals and\nimproves the quality of care.\nFinally It ultimately\nreduces the unsustainable.\nA high costs of medical devices.\nSo here is an example.\nThis is basically an outline\nof how a care device\nWorks a care device\nhas certain parameters\nthat are considered safe.\nOnce one of them is breached\nthe sensor immediately\nrealize this message\nvia a secure gateway\nto a cloud now.\nIt is vital for this\ngateway to be secure\nas it holds all your valuable\nmedical records the cloud then\npasses a remote signal\nto a Mod device\nthat is monitored\neither by a nurse\nor a caretaker at home.\nThe beauty of remote\npatient monitoring is\nthat patients can now\nreplace a long wait\nat the doctor's office\nwith a quick check-in data share\nand instructions on\nhow to proceed iot.\nHence Bridges the gap\nbetween reading devices\nand delivering Healthcare\nby creating systems rather than\njust equipment with that said,\nlet's move on to one\nof the most talked\nabout prospects of iot\nthe smart cities.\nNow the thing\nabout a smart city.\nIs that a smart City solution is\nvery specific to that one city.\nThe problems faced\nin Bombay are very different\nthan the problems\nfaced in Delhi.\nEven Global issues\nsuch as Waste Control\ntraffic management availability\nof finite drinking water housing\nand pollution impact\ndifferent cities with\ndifferent intensities.\nSo the only way to really\nmake a city smarter.\nIs to cater specifically\nto its problem one such problem\nconsistent among most\nUrban cities is traffic.\nSo imagine an intelligent device\nlike a traffic camera a camera\nthat can monitor the road\nof traffic jams\naccidents rains Etc\nand communicate that status\nto a Gateway.\nNow this Gateway also\nreceives data from various\nother cameras from all\naround the city this\nin itself could form\na Citywide traffic system.\nNow where can we use it?\nSo let's say the municipal\nCorporation has decided\nto repair a road\nwhich connects to a highway\nfor more than one city.\nNow this could cause a massive\ncongestion a smart camera\ncould send this insight\nto the Citywide traffic system\nnow considering this is\na smart traffic system\nit quickly learns\nand predicts\npatterns in traffic.\nIt will analyze the situation\npredict its impact\nand relay this information.\nTwo other cities\nthat connect to the highway via\ntheir own monitoring systems.\nNow the traffic\nManagement Systems,\nthen can derive routes\nfor cars around this projects\nlive instructions could be sent\nto drivers via radio channels\nand their respective\nsmart devices.\nWhat is a bonus is\nthat if there is a school\nor an office building\nwhich has no other way\nbut to use that road\nunder construction,\nthey can be automatically Ali\ncalled and asked to reschedule\nthis creates a network\nof self dependent systems\nwhich leverage real-time control\nand this is just one example\nof the potential benefits\nof iot applications.\nSo next we have a sector\nwhich is most neglected\ndespite the importance.\nIt holds that is agriculture.\nHowever manual handling\noften results in loss\nof energy labor cost\nand other inaccuracies,\nwhich may call its Is\nless effective internet\nof things here can provide\nwith the number\nof solutions Precision\nfarming smart irrigation\nand smart Greenhouse\nare a few to name.\nThe first two cases are\npretty similar as in both cases.\nThere are sensors\ndetecting various parameters\nat each level of the soil.\nWe have moisture\ncontent temperature\nand weather conditions\none can tell the correct\ndepth to so the crops\nor the right time to water them,\nbut One of the more\nintriguing Solutions is\nthe Smart Greenhouse a lot\nof you might be wondering\nwhat is a greenhouse.\nSo the greenhouse is\na farming technique\nwhere you can increase yield by\ncontrolling natural parameters.\nSo if we could use embedded\ndevices in these greenhouses,\nwe could not only just\nmonitor it regularly,\nbut we could practically\ncontrol the climate\ninside the greenhouse.\nSo how the system works is\nthat the sensor sends\nvarious Toes and areas\nof issue inside the greenhouse.\nThey then relay the information\nvia a connection gateway\nto the cloud\nwhich then sends remote commands\nvia the same Gateway\nback to the sensors.\nSo once these signals\nare acknowledged they\nare passed on to the switch gear\nwhich then activate\nthe lighting pumps and turbines\ninside the greenhouse\nwhich then create artificial\nsunlight and sometimes\nartificial precipitation.\nInside the greenhouse what more\nfrom the connection Gateway\nas you can see,\nthere is a monitor\nthrough which 24/7 real time\nmonitoring has come into effect.\nAlso, you could use any smart\ndevice to remove the conditions\ninside your Greenhouse.\nSo with elimination\nof irregularities\nand human errors,\nthis creates a much\nmore efficient system.\nSo with that we conclude\nthe role of Internet\nof Things in agriculture.\nSo next we have another domain\nwhere iot could prove\nto be a game-changer?\nThis is one of those fields\nwhere both faster developments\nas well as the quality\nof products are\nthe critical factors for\na higher return on investment.\nI'm talking about the\nIndustrial Automation sector,\nbut there are still\na few problems that need\nto be addressed in this sector.\nI think you all might\nhave already guessed.\nWhat I'm going to say.\nWell I OT comes to the rescue\nAgain The Internet\nof Things improves the line\nof command immensely.\nIt optimizes packaging\nand makes quality tests\nso much easier to run\nwhat more you do not even have\nto worry about the training cost\nof too much staff or a lot\nof stuff going on a holiday\nbecause these factories\npretty much run\non their own you can monitor\nthe supply chain in Real time\nwhile keeping an eye\non your inventories\nwith iot applications one could\neven re-engineer products\nand their packaging to deliver\nbetter performance in both cost\nand customer experience.\nSo this brings me to the final\napplication for today\nthat is disaster management.\nNow the iot cannot stop\ndisasters from happening,\nbut it surely can help\nin preparedness and resilience\nduring one due to high.\nHigh population density\npoor evacuation infrastructure\nand exposure to severe weather\nevents developing countries are\nmore exposed to the risks\nof natural disasters\nand often have limited means\nto sustain the effects\nas a consequence\naccording to a study\nmore than 95 percent\nof all deaths caused\nby a disaster occur\nin developing countries\niot can compensate\nfor this by prediction\npreparedness response.\nAnd Recovery to rescue\ndeveloping and emerging\ncountries from their\nvulnerable positions.\nLet me give you an example\nof a forest fire\nwhere iot could be used as\na solution to be prepared\nfor critical incidents.\nLike a forest fire sensors are\ninstalled near the perimeters\nof the forest.\nThey contribute to data feeds\nabout temperature and carbon\nemissions to a control room,\nwhich is common\nto the entire town.\nThis is done\nvia a secure network.\nGateway in real time,\nthey anticipate problems\nand put defenses\nin place to mitigate\nthat impact namely\nthe police the nearby hospitals\nand most importantly\nthe fire brigade\nif such an emergency occurs\nnear urban areas people\nand communities are alerted\nvia social media conventional\nmedia channels and SMS.\nThis brings me to the end\nof all applications\nthat I had listed now\nthat we've gone through a few.\nApplications of iot let's move\non to its future scope\nin just one year\ninternet-connected devices went\nfrom five million to billions,\nbut there are still a few areas\nthat need work.\nSo the device is forming\nthe base of iot Are Wireless\nin nature and recite\nat very remote places\nwhere energy is\na very vital issue.\nSo with growing functionality\nof each device,\nwe need algorithms and Hardware\nthat are energy efficient.\nTo avoid quick\ndraining of batteries.\nWe need to make sure\nthat sensors are active\nfor longer durations,\nlike any other\nadvancement in technology,\neven in iot security\nis a standout issue.\nThis issue keeps getting bigger\nwith more and more\ndevices being connected\nto one another we need\ninformation seclusion methods\nto benefit end clients\nand secure that\ndata and privacy.\nNo, it will be really tough\nto implement the anytime concept\nof iot in reality,\nbut this needs continuous work\nand the closest we\ncan get to this is only\nby reducing the complexity\nof each existing time systems.\nWe need continuous work\nto reduce the gap\nbetween near real-time\nand actual real-time iot\napplications promise to bring\nimmense value into our lives.\nIn fact the number of Openings\nfor iot professionals is\nat an all-time high.\nSo I think it is\nthe best time to begin\nexploring the true potential of\nthis technology from smartphones\nto Smart cards to that Fitbit\non your wrist iot represents\nmillions of rupees\nof potential for an industry\nas The Internet of Things\nbecomes more important\nfor companies of all sizes.\nIt professionals are beginning\nto seek out roles.\nRelated to this growing Niche.\nSo before going\ninto the session,\nlet's quickly look\nat our agenda.\nSo we'll start off\nby discussing a little bit\nabout the current scenario\nin iot market trends\ncurrent salary situation\nand projections in iot\nand how it compares\nto other sectors after which\nwe shall see the salary Trends\nin iot by both experienced\nand functional areas.\nAlso I shall be talking\nabout the companies\nthat are hiring for iot\nas well as the roles\nthey offer then I shall Discuss\nthe skill set you must acquire\nbefore applying into the sector.\nAnd finally we will see\nan outline of the training\nprovided a Teddy Rekha.\nSo without Much Ado,\nlet's get straight\ninto the module.\nSo with the proliferation\nof connected devices iot\nhas ventured successfully across\nall working areas in India\nand abroad India\nis quickly becoming one\nof the largest hubs for iot\nacross the globe companies\nare viewing iot as a key enabler\nin various fields\nand are Come to integrating it\ninto existing infrastructure\nas the adoption\nof iot has increased\niot Market is also expected\nto increase quite exponentially.\nSo with that let's talk\na little bit about the salary\nTrends and projections.\nNow the median salary\nof iot professionals is\n15 Point 2 lakhs per annum\nwhich is according\nto the 2017 study this figure\ncompared to the 8.65 lakh\nper annum in the eye.\nIt sector gives about 76 percent\nmore to iot professionals iot\nbeing a relatively new entrant\nProfessionals in this area\nare commanding higher salaries.\nThis number is predicted\nto go up as much as Seventeen\npoint five lakh by 2019.\nSo let's see\nhow iot does compared\nto other contemporaries?\nLike I said before I\nOT pay is 76 percent more\nthan the it sector\ninterestingly only 33% of iot.\nSpecials have salaries\nunder 6 lakh per annum as\ncompared to 58% in the it sector\nalso we can see around 16 to 18%\nof iot Professionals in India\nearn in a salary bracket\nof 10 to 25 lakhs\nper annum almost 5%\nof iot professionals occupy.\nThe largest salary bracket\nthat is 50 plus LP a while.\nIn other domains barely\ntwo percent of the workforce\ncommands this figure\nwith That said let's look\nat the salary trends\nfor it Professionals in India\nand the US according\nto the current Financial year.\nSo what I've done\nis I've divided this\ninto two parts salary is\naccording to functional areas\nand then according to\nthe experience level first up.\nWe have salary Trends\nby functional area.\nNow as you can see,\nI've divided this\ninto four functional areas,\nwhich majorly command\nthe iot industry one\nis embedded systems\nnext system programming\nthen we have the Engineering\ndesign and finally\napplication programming\nin one end of the spectrum.\nWe see application programming\nbeing the highest paying job\nin India with an average\nof 13 lakhs per annum\nwhereas its us counterpart\npays about sixty nine\nthousand dollars per annum\non the other side\nof the spectrum.\nWe have embedded Technologies,\nwhich pays an average\nof eight point two lakh\nper annum in India,\nbut in u.s.\nIt is the highest paid\nin the sector with an average\nof $9,000 per annum\nthe system programming\nand engineering design sectors\nlie somewhere in between\nwith 11 point 6 lakh per annum\nand 10 lakh per annum\nrespectively as for the\nexperience level more than 90%\nof freshers in the iot field\nfall under the 6 lakh\nper annum salary bracket,\nwhich is not a bad\nnumber for a fresher\non the other end somebody\nwho has a decade of work X\nin this field can quote up\nto a 30 + L. Your salary now.\nWhat is interesting here is\nthat from each experience level\nbracket to a higher one can lead\nto almost 50 percent jump\nin the salary with this.\nI think we've covered\nthe salary aspect\nof this industry.\nLet's move on\nto the career aspect of iot.\nI'm sure a lot\nof you must be waiting\nfor me to disclose\nthe names of companies\nand the roles they offer.\nSo the concept of iot\nhas given rise to a new era\nof economic growth\nand companies are Looking\nat it to transform\ntheir businesses now here\nyou can see two types\nof companies firstly there are\ncompanies like Dell and IBM\nwhich have a vested interest\ntheir core products\nand services are built\naround delivering\nand facilitating iot,\nbut there are also companies\nlike Verizon and Accenture\nwhere it is more\nabout preparing for the future.\nAlthough iot hasn't completely\nchanged the face of it.\nIt has definitely\ncreated new opportunities\nfor job seekers in the markets.\nI Be elaborating on this\nin the following sections\nof the module\nwhich brings me to current roles\nfor iot professional.\nNow if you were to ask me\nwhat field do you need to be\nin to land a job\nin iot the answer\nwould be many iot works\non many layers software\nplays a key role in usability\nand functionality Network layers\nare key to infrastructure and\nHardware defines capabilities\nand development opportunities\ninvolved in an iot solution.\nExisting professionals\nwith transferable skills\nwill definitely find progression\nopportunities with iot.\nThe iot is based\noff of many technologies\nthat it professionals\nare already familiar\nwith IP experts both software\nand Hardware engineers.\nAnd even UI designers could find\nthemselves to fit in somewhere\nin the industry.\nThese companies could be ranging\nfrom startups to Tech giants\nthat are driving the industry,\nbut with various domains\nthat have adopted\nthe potential usage\nof industrial IO It has led\nto a massive job creation.\nBut unlike the other fields\niot job market is a complex one\ngiven the wide variety\nof skill sets required\nin this place.\nHere are some emerging job\nprofiles for iot professionals\na few years down\nthe line first up.\nWe have solution architects.\nNow, what a solution\narchitect does is\nthat it takes an idea\nand converts it into a design\nand then takes the design\nand converts it\ninto code now a solution.\nArchitect may not be\na back-end developer,\nbut it takes the requirements\nof the company and then turns it\ninto solution blueprints\nwhich brings me\nto another very important player\nin this end-to-end execution,\nwhich is the product manager\nthe responsibilities of\na product manager may be many\nbut mostly it revolves\naround making sure\nthat the clients get\nthe solution they asked\nfor on time moving on now\nwhen we talk about iot we talk\nabout huge amounts of data.\nAnd where there is\nhuge amounts of data,\nwe have analytics on top of it.\nSo this is a job profile\ncreated specifically\nfor the iot Industrial Field,\nwhich is the\nindustrial data scientist.\nThese are data scientists\nthat basically work\nwith sensor data\nand have expertise on it.\nWhich brings me\nto another very important\nindustrial job profile,\nwhich is the\nindustrial Engineers.\nNow as I've mentioned\nbefore Hardware plays a key role\nin the development.\nMoment of connected\ndevices for that.\nWe need material Specialists\nwho can work on semiconductors\nthat are used\nto make microcontrollers\nand microprocessors\nin those connected devices.\nNext up.\nWe have another role\nthat is created specifically\nfor the iot field.\nNow iot has pushed\nthe developers to go\nbeyond a full stack.\nWe need developers\nat the back end\nwho are not only proficient\nin software coding but So in\nHardware programming, hence,\nwe have the full stack developer\nwhich brings me to our final\nemerging role in iot\nas we have all known\nand predicted very soon.\nOur shop floors are going\nto be taken over by robots.\nSo what do we need?\nWe need a supervisor\nwho can take care just in case\nthere is a miscalculation\nor a breakdown.\nThis has created\nthe final job profile that\nI'm talking about today\nthe robot coordinator.\nWith that said let's move\non to our next topic.\nSo while iot is poised\nto be the next great boom\nin the field of jobs lack\nof skill is citing the biggest\nbarrier for companies\nthat are looking to implement\nthis technology to be considered\nfor any of the rules mentioned\nearlier the qualifications.\nYou need are no different\nthan an IT development\nroll Proficiency in coding\nand fundamental in object design\nare at least required\nfor your resume to be looked\nBut the skills you need here are\nway more than that businesses\nwho engage in iot\nTechnologies are businesses\nthat are invested in the future.\nThey are seeking\nforward-thinking professionals\nwho not only meet\nstandards in academics,\nbut also have soft skills\nand Innovative thinking I\nam talking about people\nwho can integrate deep knowledge\nin embedded Technologies\nand concepts of cloud computing\nand Edge Computing.\nThese people are tipped\nmost Be in demand next up.\nWe have networking\nand communication protocol.\nThese are very important\nas devices need to be connected\nto one another at all times\nin real time.\nFinally.\nWe need professionals\nwho can convey a complex idea\nin simple ways either speech\nwritten communication\nor other abstract methods.\nSo the iot job market\nis the perfect platform\nfor job Seekers\nto Showcase their skills\nand for companies\nto establish relationships\nwith These professionals\nso this is the best time to get\ninto this technology\nand who better to guide you then\nthe iot trainers at Eddie Rekha.\nSo Ed Eureka provides\nan iot certification training\nand the outline of a syllabus\nlook something like this.\nThis training course\nis tailored specifically\nby industry experts\nand a takes you through Concepts\nsuch as iot framework ecosystem\nand solution architecture it\nalso teaches you networking\nprotocols and application.\nOur in-depth you\nshall be working\nwith Raspberry Pi and sends hats\nand will gain hands-on\nexperience with Azure iot Hub\nand Alexa voice.\nThis course also\nhas a real life demo\nand case studies\nwhich will help you master\nthe iot technology.\nSo concluding I\nwould like to say\nthat iot is amidst an explosion\nthis definitely suggest\noptimistic future for\nprofessionals looking to dive\ninto this industry.\nSo grab this opportunity\nwhile you still have it.\nThank you and have\na great day ahead.\nI hope you have enjoyed\nlistening to this video.\nPlease be kind enough to like it\nand you can comment any\nof your doubts and queries\nand we will reply them\nat the earliest do look out\nfor more videos in our playlist\nAnd subscribe to
