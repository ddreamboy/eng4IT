  "text": "[Music]\nhello and welcome all to this YouTube\nsession there's a doll from a Eureka and\nin today's session we'll be dealing with\nsentiment analysis using Python like you\nall know the success of a company or\nproduct directly depends on its customer\nright so the customer likes your product\nit's your success if not then you\ncertainly need to improvise it by making\nsome changes in it so how will you know\nwhether your product is successful or\nnot well for that you need to analyze\nyour customers and one of the attributes\nof analyzing your customer is to analyze\nthe sentiment of them and this is where\nthe sentiment analysis comes into\npicture so starting with word is\nsentiment analysis well you can define\nsentiment analysis as a process of\ncomputationally identifying and\ncategorizing opinions from a piece of\ntext and determine whether the writers\nattitude towards a particular topic or\nthe product is positive negative or\nneutral well it might be possible not as\nan individual every time you don't\nperform a sentiment analysis but you do\nlook for a feedback right like before\npurchasing a product you can look for a\nfeedback like what the other customers\nhave to say about that particular\nproduct whether it isn't good or bad\nright and you analyze it manually by\nlooking at their feedbacks now just\nconsider at the company level so how\nwill the company analyze what the\ncustomers is thinking about their\nproduct they don't have just one or two\ncustomers right they have more than\nmillions of customers so what they will\ndo so this is where the company needs to\nperform sentiment analysis to know\nwhether the product is actually doing\ngood in the market or not ok fine so now\nthat you know what exactly sentiment\nanalysis let's move on and see how does\nit actually work so let's take the\nstatement as an example the movie was\ngreat so the very first step would be\nthe step of tokenization so what exactly\nis tokenization tokenization is nothing\nbut dividing your Pera into a different\nset of statements or dividing a\nstatement into different set of words so\nthe statement the movie was great would\nbe further segregated into its different\nwords so once the process of\norganization is done so the second step\nwould be cleaning the data so by\ncleaning the data I mean to remove all\nthese special characters or any other\nword which do not add any value to the\nanalytics part\nso as in step two I'd be removing the\nspecial characters so I don't need this\nexclamation mark over here so I'm left\nwith four words though movie was and\ngreat\nso next step would be removing the stop\nwords like I said I do not need any word\nwhich do not add any value to the\nanalytics result so the stop words like\nthe was is he/she do not add much value\nto the analytics part so we can easily\nremove them so now we are just left with\ntwo words movie and great okay now step\nfour is the classification step so now\nthat you are left with just two words\nwhat your task will be your task will be\nto classify them as whether it is a\npositive word or a negative word or a\nneutral word for a positive word we give\na sentiment score as plus one for a\nnegative we have a minus one score and\nfor a neutral wig of zero now this is\nthe part where machine learning comes\nyou can model your data with bag of\nwords or you can use lexicons which are\nnothing but a dictionary of pre\nclassified set of words and now once the\nmodel strain you can perform the test on\nthe analysis statement and mode the\naccuracy score better will be the\nclassification right if your model is\ntoo accurate then yes it will be a very\ngood classification so well now what we\nhave done we have classified our words\nas positive and negative the sentiment\nscore of movie is zero as it's a neutral\nword and great is a plus one according\nto dictionary it's a positive word even\nyou know that it's a positive word right\nso let's move on ahead and calculate the\nfinal sentiment score of the sentence\nnow since we have just two words over\nhere which adds some values to the\nanalytics part so on combining the\nstatement you can say that we have one\nplus zero that equals one so now you can\nsay that since the polarity is greater\nthan zero so the statement is positive\nwell for a beginner level you can say\nthat this was a step by step calculation\nfor sentiment analysis don't worry when\nyou are using Python it's more simple\nthan you can think let me show you how\nsimple is set to perform sentiment\nanalysis in Python so for the quick\nstart we'll be using text blob which is\na Python library for processing textual\ndata it will allow you to perform common\nNLP tasks such as parts of speech\ntagging down for his extraction\nsentiment analysis classification and\nmany other things\nso let's start by importing text blob\nand calculate the polarity of each\nstatement and determine whether the\nstatement is positive negative or\nneutral all right\nwell by the time it's executing let's\ndefine our parameters or define our\nfeedback and let's suppose our first\nfeedback was feedback 1 equals the food\nat Radisson was awesome ok and my next\nfeedback is\nand the food and radisson was very good\nall right well as you can see a boat\nseemed to be almost a positive statement\nright but let's check how positive\nthey're all a sentiment analysis is all\nabout checking how positive or how\nnegative a statement is okay so let's\ndefine our blob so my blob one will be\nblob of first feedback all right and my\nblob - will be text blob of feedback to\ncall it so now all you need to do is\nprint your sentiment Ripple\nalright so a sentiment report will\nconsist of the measure of polarity as\nwell as subjectivity well you can just\nkeep it to polarity or subjectivity as\nwell but for this video I'll be focusing\non both the polarity measure as well as\nthe subjectivity Messier\nso let's print a sentiment report blob\ndot sentiments so blob one dot sentiment\nand print\non print block 2 dot sentiment let's see\nwhat's the result\nalik saw sentiment report is ready for a\nstatement one the polarities 1.0 it's\nhighly positive statement whereas the\nsubjectivity it's also one point zero\nand four statement two you can see that\nthe polarity is 0.9 and at\nsubjectivities 0.7 this polarity measure\nwill tell you how positive your\nstatement is or how negative your\nstatement is and this subjectivity it\nexpresses about personal feelings views\nor beliefs so let's take an example like\na subjective sentence so subjective\nexpression comes in many forms example\nopinion allegation desires believes\nsuspicions and speculation a subjective\nsentence may not express any sentiment\nall right for example I think that he\nwent home and I want a camera that can\ntake good photos these are all just\nsubjective sentence they do not express\nany sentiment right so well this was\nvery basic example so in my next video\nI'll show you how you can fetch data\nfrom Twitter and apply sentiment\nanalysis on your tweet using text blob\nand creepy thank you all this was all\nfor this session and don't forget to\nwatch my next video on Twitter sentiment\nanalysis in Python using creepy and\nexplore thank you I hope you have\nenjoyed listening to this video please\nbe kind enough to like it and you can\ncomment any of your doubts and queries\nand we will reply them at the earliest\ndo look out for more videos in
