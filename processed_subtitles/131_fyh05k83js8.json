ASCII which was a\nsimple computer language that allowed\nmachines produced by different\nmanufacturers to exchange data in 1969\nARPANET was launched by the Advanced\nResearch Projects Agency ARPANET was an\nearly network used by government\nresearch groups and universities and the\nforerunner to the Internet the early\n1970s see a growing trend in the popular\nsubculture of phone phreaks\nor freaker's who used blue boxes as tone\ngenerators to make free phone calls\npopular phone freaker's include Steve\nWozniak of Apple who built his own blue\nbox which he sold to fellow UC Berkeley\nstudents with the use of a blue box\nphone freaker's could unlock a tMT's\nphone network to make prank calls or\nhave access to free telephone services\nin 1979 engineers at Xerox Palo Alto\nResearch Center discovered the computer\nworm a worm is a short program that\nscours and network for idle processors\nit was originally designed to provide\nmore efficient computer use it is the\nancestor of the modern worm which is a\ndestructive computer virus that alters\nor erases data on computers in 1983 the\nterm computer virus is coined by Fred\nCohen to describe a computer program\nthat can affect other computer programs\nby modifying them in such a way as to\ninclude a possibly evolved copy of\nitself then in 1984 the term cyberspace\nis popularized by author William Gibson\nwho used the word to describe the\nnetwork of computers through which the\ncharacters and his futuristic novels\ntravel the first computer virus was\nreleased in 1986 known as the brain the\nvirus is released by Pro\nin Pakistan the next major cyber attack\noccurs in 1988 Robert Morris unleashes a\nworm that invades ARPANET computers and\ndisables roughly 6000 computers on the\nnetwork by flooding the memory banks\nwith copies of itself\nMorris is fined $10,000 and sentenced to\nthree years probation\nfinally in 1991 norton antivirus\nsoftware is released by Symantec this\nmarks the release of one of the first\nantivirus softwares available from the\n1990s on cyberattacks have been\nincreasing with famous attacks including\nthe solar sunrise the Melissa virus the\nstring of DDoS attacks the code red worm\nand the Nimba virus the list of cyber\nattacks continues with more and more\ncomputers targeted with each attack in\naddition to the growth in the number of\nattacks and the number of infected\nsystems the sophistication of the\nattacks continues to increase as we can\nsee from historical trends cyber threats\nare becoming more frequent more\ndangerous and more specialized there are\nthree focal points in the world of cyber\nsecurity and potential threats as we\nlook forward to 2013\nfirst the widespread use of multiple new\nplatforms creates new points of attacks\nfor hackers second as exploit kits\nbecome more powerful and prevalent while\nat the same time enabling use by less\ntechnically proficient users attacks are\ngoing to increase third we can see from\nhistorical trends that attacks are\ngrowing in sophistication often\ntargeting specific organizations or\ngovernments this trend is unlikely to\nrevert so users and IT managers will\nneed to remain current on trends in\ncyber security assaults mobile usage is\nincreasing exponentially especially as\nusers gain access to smartphones and\ntablets in fact in Australia and the\nUnited States an Android device is more\nlikely to experience a malware attack\nwhether failed or successful than a PC\nover a month-long period employers\nlooking to curb costs as the price of\nnew devices continues to rise are\nturning to bring your own device or BYOD\npolicies and they\nbuilding users to access company or\ngovernment information from personal\ndevices opens up another frontier for\ncyberattack\nadditionally mobile devices offer unique\npoints of attack due to the microphone\nand camera hardware inclusions in\naddition to data actually stored on or\naccessed from the device attackers may\nbe able to use the phone as a\nsurveillance tool to gather more\ninformation often cyber exploits take\nthe form of executable files in the PC\nenvironment on mobile devices that allow\nthe usage of apps security can be more\ndifficult to achieve Apple's App Store\nis known for a very strict oversight\nthat is managed to control release of\nmalicious or rogue applications too most\niPhone users Android now the most\npopular OS for mobile devices is not as\nsecure users have the ability to\ndownload apps from multiple sources and\neven directly install them on their own\nthis is a key concern for IT managers\nconsidering allowing usage of Android\ndevices for work purposes Eugene\nKaspersky predicts that attacks on the\nApple iOS platform will increase now\nthat more software engineers are seeking\ntraining for the Mac environment for\nexample in early 2012 nearly half a\nmillion Mac users were infected with the\nflashback trojan the cloud perhaps one\nof the biggest buzzwords of the last\nyear or so the cloud allows users to\naccess information from almost anywhere\nattackers may choose to exploit this in\na variety of ways stealing or destroying\nkey data using denial of service attacks\nto prevent legitimate use or even\nhijacking cloud traffic and redirecting\nit to other potentially more dangerous\nmalicious content these attacks can all\ncause significant disruption to\nbusinesses so IT managers should\ncarefully consider the decision to push\nforward with cloud computing\nparticularly in regards to security\nsocial media is a new platform that\nallows complete strangers to gain more\naccess to information about others\nmaking the fraud more credible according\nto a recent study as much as 15% of all\nFacebook users have never even looked at\ntheir privacy settings similar to older\nemail exploits social media allows\naccess to an individual's entire social\nnetwork rather than just their address\nbook additionally the speed of\ninformation shared on\nsocial networks and the type of\ninformation shared tends to make users\nmore curious and susceptible to\nfraudulent activities such as the posted\nreference did you see this embarrassing\nphoto of user and then redirects the\nuser to malicious content\nadditionally sources like LinkedIn\nprovide access to information about\nwhere users work and where they attended\nschool make incredible conversations\nmore possible as attackers may pose as\nalumni or professional associations when\nattempting to gather information\nFoursquare and other check in functions\non social networks provide geolocation\ntracking for even further exploit\npossibly used in combination with other\ninformation gathered to access and\ncontrol bank and financial records and\ntransactions offering access to those\nbordering on the computer illiterate\nexploit kits are the readily available\nequivalent of the for dummies book\nseries in the cyber assault world often\nfound via underground or black market\nchannels exploit kits are essentially\npre-written code that target\napplications with known security\nbreaches and users who rarely update\ntheir software generally the kits\nrequire no knowledge of how the exploit\nworks and users simply deploy them and\nthen login to a landing page that allows\naccess to features like which systems\nhave been attacked have been\nsuccessfully exploited and then enabling\nmonetization of the exploit in several\nways approximately 70% of all exploit\nkits currently originate from Russia\nlastly cyber attacks are becoming\nincreasingly sophisticated and often\ntargeted at specific organizations\ncorporations or governments these\nattacks are gaining popularity because\nthere is significant monetary value that\ncan be associated with cyber attacks and\nperhaps more concerning is the ability\nto capture headlines groups of cyber\ncriminals or protestors are loosely\nclaiming the title of hacktivists\ntargeting government and corporate\nnetworks to draw attention to their\ncause 2011 and 2012 saw numerous attacks\nfrom groups such as anonymous introduced\nin the opening video and subsequent\narrests of activists have taken place\nbut the reality is that they are likely\nhere to stay into the foreseeable future\nnation state-sponsored attacks or\nwarfare has entered the public\nconsciousness one recent example is that\nof Stuxnet a computer worm discovered in\n2010 believed to have been created by\nthe United States and Israel to attack\nIran's nuclear facilities one of the\nmore dangerous threats that has come to\nrise oblate is the advanced persistent\nthreat or apt apts are very\nsophisticated and customized malware\nexploits that lie dormant for a period\nof time before wreaking havoc on\nunsuspecting users these targeted\nattacks are significantly more difficult\nto defend whether it's for a hacktivist\norganization's cause or a\nstate-sponsored assault one thing is\nclear which is that individuals and\norganizations need to protect themselves\nand stay current on the latest exploits\ntechniques and trends in cybersecurity\nas only relying on antivirus software\nand basic firewalls alone is likely\ngoing to be insufficient going forward\nin response to these cybersecurity\nthreats\nbusinesses and individuals can implement\nsolutions to increase security for their\nmobile devices cloud computing and\npersonal information found on social\nmedia sites in addition to that we will\ndiscuss how the risk of exploits can be\nmitigated and the recent government\ninvolvement in cybersecurity there are\nmany solutions to protecting users\nagainst mobile cyber security threats\nthe first solution is the Equipment\nIdentity register which is a nationwide\ndatabase built and maintained by\nwireless companies this database\nprevents smartphones reported as lost or\nstolen from being activated for voice\nand data services by thieves next we\nhave the password mobile device lock\nwhich is available on almost all\nsmartphones new features like minimum\npassword length and password complexity\nrequirements have increased mobile\nsecurity users can also remotely lock\nand remotely wipe their smartphones data\nin the event that devices are lost or\nstolen with applications like Find My\niPhone for iPhones and remote lock for\nthe Android phones mobile device\nmanagement software secures monitors\nmanages and supports mobile devices\ncompanies that implement an MDM policy\nwould require company mobile devices to\naccess information by using a compliant\npassword\nthis would allow the company to remotely\nwipe any devices that become compromised\na virtual private network or VPN extends\na private network and the resources\ncontained in the network across public\nnetworks like the internet a VPN\nprovides security so that traffic sent\nthrough the VPN connection stays\nisolated from other devices on the\npublic network there are a variety of\nencryption options for data that resides\non a mobile device encryption transforms\ninformation rendering it unreadable to\nanyone except those possessing the\ncorrect login or key information\nlikewise encryption can also be used to\nprotect data in transit as it moves from\na mobile device to a mobile network next\ndepending on the operating system\nanti-malware and antivirus software may\nbe available to prevent detect and\nremove malware of all descriptions\nincluding viruses malware adware\nbackdoors trojan horses and worms as\ncompanies expand their BYOD policies\nthey should also look into software\nsolutions that provide a separate and\nsecure virtual environment for BYOD\nmobile devices lastly since a user\nsingle password can be stolen or guessed\nusers can use two-factor authentication\nwhich can include a digital identifier\nor time-based random number in addition\nto a password\nexamples of these two-factor\nauthentication can be found through text\nmessages a random number identifier\ncommonly used in many mobile banking\napps companies and organizations looking\nto migrate to the cloud should ensure\nthat the company they choose has been\ncertified and has successfully passed\nthird party audits one such important\ncertification is ISO 27001 which\nrequires a management actively manage\ninformation security controls on an\nongoing basis as a nature of\ncybersecurity threats change next it is\nimperative that the clouds host has the\nlatest security initiatives in place to\nprotect its infrastructure to include\nthe facilities network and hardware as\nwell as the operating system this can be\ndone through employing a variety of the\nlatest IT security standards to ensure\nyour clouds host is resilient to\nhardware failures or cyber attacks a\nbusiness\nnew management system and plan is\nimportant such a plan should include an\nautomated process which would move\ncustomer data traffic away from servers\nor data centers that have been\ncompromised\nlastly network security and cloud\nservices is of the utmost importance a\ncloud host secure network architecture\nshould consist of network devices\nincluding firewall and other boundary\ndevices that monitor and control\ncommunications across the entire network\nand a key access points securing a cloud\nservices access points allow users to\nestablish secure communication cloud\nhosting can provide transmission\nprotection by connecting to the clouds\naccess points through a secure sockets\nlayer or SSL which is a cryptographic\nprotocol that is designed to protect\nagainst eavesdropping tampering and\nmessage forgery here are some tips to\nhelp protect yourself from cyber attacks\nvia social media protect your passwords\nby not using the same password for more\nthan one site and choose one that means\nsomething to you only in particular\ndon't use your online password for any\nother site and be sure to change your\npasswords frequently secure your answers\nby keeping personal information about\nyourself private including family\nmembers school telephone numbers exact\nbirthday and address and never confirm\nor update personal information requested\nvia email this threat is called phishing\nstrengthen your settings by setting up\nprivacy restrictions on all social media\nsites and reconsider geolocation apps\nthat reveal your physical location be\nless friendly by being skeptical of\nstrange people posts pages and\ninformation never open emails from\nstrangers and never click on links or\nopen attachments for unfamiliar sites it\nis important to note that one in five\nAmericans have been the victim of a\ncyber crime yet only 15% of all\nAmericans have ever checked to see what\ntheir social networking privacy and\nsecurity settings are when it comes to\ncombating the threat of exploit kits the\nfirst step is to mitigate the risk this\nshould be a two-pronged approach\nstarting with assessing your\nvulnerabilities and performing\npenetration tests\npenetration tests can help businesses\nunderstand weak points by intentionally\nhacking their own systems before a bad\nguy does the second step is to plug the\nidentified holes in your system this\ncould be as simple as ensuring that all\nsoftware updates have been deployed on\nall devices connected to the company's\nnetwork ensuring that employees are\nusing a secure browser and using auto\nupdate features for all computer\nprograms one way of helping to prevent\nexploit kits from stealing information\nis to use techniques like code signing\nand digital signatures code signing\nallows businesses to protect their users\ndata from software that has been\ntampered with by malware\nlastly security cannot be treated as a\nset and forget function all security\nprocesses need to be evaluated on a\ncontinual basis to ensure your\norganization is not just protected from\nthe risks of today but also the threats\nof tomorrow with the rising threat of\ncyber crimes the United States\ngovernment has also become involved in\nFebruary of this year President Obama\nreleased an executive order designed to\nstrengthen the cybersecurity of American\nbusinesses by increasing information\nsharing between companies first the\nexecutive order allows US companies to\nshare threat and attack information with\neach other this enables companies to\nlearn what is happening to other\norganizations so that they can better\nprotect themselves from similar threats\nadditionally the order calls for the\ndevelopment of a cybersecurity framework\nby the National Institute of Standards\nand Technology this will help reduce\ncyber risks and prevent attacks by\nensuring that a common core of standards\nis being used across the board to do\nthis an ist will work to identify the\ncurrent consensus standards and\nincorporate industry best practices into\nthe cybersecurity framework on behalf of\ngroup 12 I would like to thank you for\nlistening to our presentation if you\nhave any questions please leave them on\nthe discussion board page for us to\nanswer now for your viewing pleasure\nstay tuned after the references for a\ntop 10 list of computer hackers watching\nthis video is optional of course thank\nyou again and enjoy\nin their indictments they say I left the\nnetwork's open to further attack but the\nnetworks were completely open to attack\nand I never had to break into the right\nlog run\nwe\nyou\n",
