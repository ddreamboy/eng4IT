  "text": "hello lovely humans jen fox here\nin this video we are going to look at\nhow to do sentiment analysis\nin microsoft excel for free\nparty time so this service is available\nin\noffice 365. well in excel\nand so it's an add-in that you can\nincorporate from azure machine learning\nand it allows us to do sentiment\nanalysis basically\nif i'm looking at some text the\nsentiment analysis\nwill tell me if the text is a\npositive sentiment if someone is feeling\nyou know positive about something\nor if someone's feeling negative about\nsomething\nit's keep in mind like most machine\nlearning\nit's you know not perfect just like\npeople\nand it tends to work on shorter text\nversus\nlonger text so that said\nlet's dig in to how we pull in\nsentiment analysis into excel and how we\nrun it on\nour data yay all right so\nthis is how to do sentiment analysis\nfor free in microsoft excel woohoo\ni was really stoked when i found out\nabout this feature\num and even more stoked that it's free\nso to do this first we need some\ntext i snagged reviews\nabout the xbox i just i grabbed\nthem from amazon\nuh so let's see if we can get the\nsentiment\nof each review so we can better\nunderstand if folks\nliked it or they didn't like it so\nfirst go to the insert tab in excel\nand then go to my add-ins click\nsee all and we want to add in this\nazure machine learning add-in if you\ndon't have it\nhighlighted you probably don't just\nsearch for azure machine\nlearning and click enter and then you\nwould click\nadd and then we say continue\nand it will pop up woohoo so\nthen we want to do text sentiment\nanalysis\n so it's a little\nfunky how it expects the data so the\nfirst thing\nis click on this view schema\nschema schema and we need to\ntitle our uh column header with\ntweet underscore text because that\nis how the sentiment analysis recognizes\nthe text in this column is to be\nanalyzed\nand i was running it at one point and i\nhad an extra space in there and it\ngave me an error so make sure it's just\nlike this\nactually let's do that as a well i'll\nshow you after\ni guess so make sure it looks exactly\nlike this\nthen we can close that and\nthen we want to give our input range\nvalues i was just\ntesting this so then we\nhighlight whoopsies we can click on this\noop\ncome on click on this no\nwhat what is happening okay there we go\nokay\n so we click on this to highlight\nall of the text that we want to analyze\n and then we just need to give um a\nsingle output cell um so for some reason\ni can't see this\nbutton so i'm just going to be lazy and\ncopy this\nand click this and say c1 so we'll skip\ncolumn b and just put in c\num and really quickly it has to just be\na single\ncolumn critical\nand make sure that my data has headers\nis selected\num and i would also recommend selecting\ninclude headers\n so then we will say predict\nand hopefully everything's right yay so\nin the\nuh first column we have the sentiment\noutput\nand then we in the right column we have\nthe score so\nsentiment analysis is done on a scale of\nzero to one\na 0.5 is considered to be neutral\na score closer to 1 is considered to be\npositive\nand a score closer to 0 is considered to\nbe negative\nso one thing that i want to point out\nand close this to give us more\nspace is that this negative score\nis larger than this negative score\nso you might\nyou might find that this review is\nmore quote unquote negative than\nthis review um so that's one way to\ninterpret that\nanother way to interpret it is just that\nthe machine learning algorithm\nwas more confident that this was a\nnegative sentiment\nand so as we go down\nthis one's kind of interesting this is\nactually a\nand it looks like the sentiment analysis\ndidn't do great on it\nbecause the first sentence is positive\num so\n i would say that this is a positive\nreview\nso this is you know it's a useful tool\n but i have\nfound that it tends to work better on\nshorter\ntext so one of the things that we could\ndo\nis you know remove some of this text and\nrun the sentiment analysis again\n so i'm going to click this and see if it\nchanges this score\nall right and so we don't need to change\nanything here\n oh that's interesting\nit might be that the phrasing is a\nlittle funky um so\nit's not perfect but if you have a lot\nof text data this can give you a general\nunderstanding of sentiment um and then\nreally quickly i just want to show you\nwhat error gets thrown\nif this isn't quite right so if you have\nan extra space and you click to predict\n[Music]\ni'm gonna laugh if it doesn't actually\ngive me an error this time\nit's really funny predict there we go\n so message um\ninput column name column names must\nmatch the

    "about the xbox i just i grabbed",
    "them from amazon",
    "uh so let's see if we can get the",
    "sentiment",
    "of each review so we can better",
    "understand if folks",
    "liked it or they didn't like it so",
    "first go to the insert tab in excel",

    "then we want to do text sentiment",
    "analysis",
    "so it's a little",
    "funky how it expects the data so the",
    "first thing",
    "is click on this view schema",
    "schema schema and we need to",
    "title our uh column header with",
    "tweet underscore text because that",
    "is how the sentiment analysis recognizes",

    "actually let's do that as a well i'll",

    "i guess so make sure it looks exactly",
    "like this",
    "then we can close that and",
    "then we want to give our input range",
    "values i was just",
    "testing this so then we",
    "highlight whoopsies we can click on this",
    "oop",
    "come on click on this no",
    "what what is happening okay there we go",
    "okay",
    "so we click on this to highlight",
    "all of the text that we want to analyze",
    "and then we just need to give um a",
    "single output cell um so for some reason",
    "i can't see this",
    "button so i'm just going to be lazy and",
    "copy this",
    "and click this and say c1 so we'll skip",
    "column b and just put in c",
    "um and really quickly it has to just be",
    "a single",
    "column critical",
    "and make sure that my data has headers",
    "is selected",
    "um and i would also recommend selecting",
    "include headers",
    "so then we will say predict",
    "and hopefully everything's right yay so",
    "in the",
    "uh first column we have the sentiment",
    "output",
    "and then we in the right column we have",
    "the score so",
    "sentiment analysis is done on a scale of",
    "zero to one",
    "a 0.5 is considered to be neutral",
    "a score closer to 1 is considered to be",
    "positive",
    "and a score closer to 0 is considered to",
    "be negative",
    "so one thing that i want to point out",
    "and close this to give us more",
    "space is that this negative score",
    "is larger than this negative score",
    "so you might",
    "you might find that this review is",
    "more quote unquote negative than",
    "this review um so that's one way to",
    "interpret that",
    "another way to interpret it is just that",
    "the machine learning algorithm",
    "was more confident that this was a",
    "negative sentiment",
    "and so as we go down",
    "this one's kind of interesting this is",
    "actually a",
    "and it looks like the sentiment analysis",
    "didn't do great on it",
    "because the first sentence is positive",
    "um so",
    "i would say that this is a positive",
    "review",
    "so this is you know it's a useful tool",
    "but i have",
    "found that it tends to work better on",
    "shorter",
    "text so one of the things that we could",
    "do",
    "is you know remove some of this text and",
    "run the sentiment analysis again",
    "so i'm going to click this and see if it",
    "changes this score",
    "all right and so we don't need to change",
    "anything here",
    "oh that's interesting",
    "it might be that the phrasing is a",
    "little funky um so",
    "it's not perfect but if you have a lot",
    "of text data this can give you a general",
    "understanding of sentiment um and then",
    "really quickly i just want to show you",
    "what error gets thrown",
    "if this isn't quite right so if you have",
    "an extra space and you click to predict",
    "[Music]",
    "i'm gonna laugh if it doesn't actually",
    "give me an error this time",
    "it's really funny predict there we go",
    "so message um",
    "input column name column names must",
    "match the schema",
    "column names only in schema",
    "tweet text and then um yeah",
    "so basically if you read that it it",
    "tells you",
    "in effect that your column header is is",
    "funky",
    "um so then i remove the extra space",
    "and i click predict again and no error",
    "all right so i hope that is helpful",
    "uh this is a free service that comes",
    "with",
    "office 365. go forth and enjoy it",
