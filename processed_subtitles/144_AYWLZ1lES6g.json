  "text": "from the day i started messing around with \nsome data in Excel it took me about three  \nyears to land a data analyst job at Heineken and \nanother two years to land a job as a freelance  \ndata analyst at a big bank in Europe and another \ntwo years to quit that job and travel the world  \nfull-time but more on that later can you become \na data analyst way faster? 100% i've wasted too  \nmany hours watching youtube tutorials and i've \nspent money on Udemy courses that didn't add  \nany value so i often ask myself if i could start \nover with data analysis knowing what i know today  \nhow would i go about it? and that's exactly what \nthis video is about i'll remove all the fluff and  \ngive you the fastest path to go from zero to \na full-time data analyst and throughout this  \nvideo i will share the three major mistakes almost \nevery data analyst makes so stay tuned for those  \nthe first thing every beginner data analyst needs \nto pick is a tool or programming language for data  \nanalysis i personally started off with Excel is \nthat the best tool there is for data analysis no  \nif i could go back in time would have started \nwith something else also no because apparently  \ngetting good at Excel was enough for my first \ndata analysis job and i personally recommend  \nevery single data analyst to start off with \nExcel it's easy to learn used in almost every  \ncompany and it has a wide range of applications \nfor data analysis but this is also it's pitfall  \nalthough you can do a lot of different things \nin Excel it's not designed specifically for  \ndata analysis meaning it has its limitations \nyou want to work with a very large data set  \nwell good luck not punching through your computer \nscreen after Excel crashes for the 27th time  \nExcel is perfect for starting out but once \nyou've mastered excel it's time to move on  \nto the more serious tools and the most logical \ntool to learn next is SQL next to Excel it is  \napparently the second most requested skill in data \nanalyst job openings huge thanks to Luke Barousse  \nfor actually scraping a lot of Linkedin \njob openings to come up with these facts  \nyou're a legend man thank you what up that nerds \nand the reason SQL is so in demand is because  \nit doesn't have the same limitations as Excel \nwhy is my accent suddenly changing to southern  \ni don't know what with SQL you can extract \ntransform and load very large data sets but  \nthe best thing about it is that SQL has its own \nvery easy to use programming language it's a great  \ntool to add to your skill set as a data analyst \nwhile also being a great stepping stone to some  \nmore serious programming but before we get to \nthat every data analyst needs a visualization  \ntool there are dozens of BI tools out there but \nhaving worked for multiple companies and projects  \nand having looked at probably hundreds of data \nanalyst job openings i've come to realize that  \nthe majority of companies are looking for people \nwith experience with Tableau Power BI and Qlikview  \nhere's the pros and cons of each so you can decide \nwhich suits you best Power BI is part of the  \nMicrosoft stack so it works smoothly with Excel \nand Sharepoint besides that it has a free version  \nand even the paid versions are relatively budget \nfriendly compared to the other BI tools next up is  \nTableau Tableau is a BI tool with more extensive \ndata visualization capabilities than Power BI  \nit seems to be just a bit more in demand in \nthe job market than Power BI it comes with  \na much higher price tag though making it harder \nto learn if you're starting out by yourself and  \nthen there's Qlikview using in-memory technology \nmaking it a super fast and responsive way of doing  \nbusiness intelligence but also a pretty high price \ntag and also it's less in demand than Tableau and  \nPower BI i personally picked Power BI as my BI \ntool although it might not be the fastest BI tool  \nout there or the one with the most extensive \ncapabilities in my opinion it can give you  \nthe most bang for buck when it comes to becoming a \nfull-time data analyst before we move on to how to  \nactually get good at data analysis and land that \nfirst job there's one more thing we need to do  \nas a data analyst after you've mastered a BI tool \nit's time to get into the more advanced analytics  \ni'm talking about which programming language \nto use when it comes to data analysis or data  \nscience software developers and programmers get to \nchoose between java javascript ruby c-sharp python  \nr c c++ and many more luckily for us data analysts \nwe only have to choose between two programming  \nlanguages r and python so which one should you \npick i chose python but if i could go back in  \ntime i would choose python why well even though \nthey're actually very similar r is a programming  \nlanguage focused more on statistical analysis \nwell python is a more general purpose programming  \nlanguage that also happens to be very good for \ndata analysis and although r might be a little  \nbit easier to learn i would still go for python as \nit's the probably probably probably the number one  \nprogramming language in the world meaning if you \nget good at python for data analysis it might also  \nopen the door to a lot of different job \nopportunities so the path i took is Excel  \nSQL Power BI and Python this is the path i would \nrecommend as it worked out great for me but you  \ncan start off with any language or tool that \nsuits you best because whatever you pick your  \nfirst language or tool will definitely not be your \nlast so now that you know which tools to learn  \nlet's talk about how to actually learn it and \nthis is where beginners make the first major  \nmistake the mistake most beginners make is that \nthey try to learn by watching others this is how  \nmost people learn data analysis some people go to \nUdemy and watch multiple 20 plus hour courses and  \nprobably not even finish all of them or they watch \nyoutube videos watching other people analyze data  \nbut without actually writing code or analyzing \ndata themselves they give themselves a false  \nsense of progress because analyzing data in your \nhead is very different than from actually doing it\ndata analysis in your head is very different \nfrom actually analyzing data stumbling upon  \nfaulty data and debugging for hours so what is \nthe right way to do it? the answer is very simple:  \nlearn by doing you just need to get the \nreps in and start coding and analyzing  \ndata by yourself for Excel i would recommend \na website called www.excel-practice-online.com  \na free website where you learn to use Excel \nby doing from the basics to the most advanced  \nfunctionalities for SQL i would recommend the \nwebsite www.w3schools.com/sql for Power BI i  \nwould recommend Datacamp there's free courses \nand also paid ones for python you can go to  \nthis free website called learnpython.org whether \nyou're practicing every day at your current job  \nso you can make that switch to a data analysis \ncareer or whether you're still studying you need  \nto practice every single day only this way will \nyou experience what it's actually like working as  \na data analyst analysis working as a data analyst \nonly then will you learn what it's like to debug  \nyour own code or formulas because to be honest \nthat's what you will spend the most time on  \ndebugging faulty code or correcting faulty data \nbeing a data analyst is awesome but this is also  \nthe second major mistake most beginners make they \ntry to solve every problem themselves the fact is  \nthat error you just got in Power BI there's a very \nbig chance someone already has experienced exactly  \nthe same error as you and that's good news for you \nbecause now you don't have to look for the cause  \nof the error you just have to copy part of the \nerror message in google and you probably end up on  \nsome stack overflow website where someone explains \nexactly how to solve this error let's be honest  \ncopying code from stack overflow is like 80% \nof any developer programmer or data analyst job  \ndata analyst is awesome okay now that you know \nwhat tool and programming language to pick  \nand how to actually learn it it's time to build \nyour portfolio and this will help you build  \nout an attractive CV for recruiters on Linkedin \nrecruiters i always talk like a bit this i know  \nprogrammer so strange programming language \nand recruiters talk to me every day now if  \nyou have a job where you can apply data analytics \nalready then do so right away if you don't really  \ndo anything data analytics related like sales for \nexample then try to build a report or a dashboard  \nshowing some key metrics or KPI's that you \ncan show to your manager he will appreciate  \nit and you will get to learn your data analysis \nskills and if you can't apply to your current job  \nor if you're still studying then start a project \non your own at home because in the end it's about  \ngetting that data analyst job and the best way \nto do that is as follows pimp up your Linkedin  \nprofile i've made a video before where i give \nmy top five Linkedin profile tips to attract  \nrecruiters on Linkedin and i'll summarize it here \nfor you make sure you put data analysts in as many  \nplaces as you can in your profile Linkedin is a \nsearch engine and if recruiters search for data  \nanalysts you want to be found you want to be on \ntop of that list so make sure your header contains  \nthe word data analyst in your work experience \nif you've done something data analyst related  \nput in the keyword data analyst once your Linkedin \nprofile is set up there's two things you can do  \nstart applying to every single data analyst \njob you can find on Linkedin or any other job  \nplatform or the second way which i prefer is if \nyou've set up your Linkedin profile correctly  \nthen recruiters will soon start hunting you they \nwill invite you to job interviews for data analyst  \npositions which brings me to major mistake number \nthree don't quit well do quit let me explain you  \nsee the second best decision i have ever made \nin my life was becoming a data analyst and to  \nbecome one yourself the only thing you have to do \nis don't quit whether it will take you one week  \none month or one year if you keep applying if you \nkeep improving your skills updating your CV you  \nwill land that job eventually and trust me once \nyou do land that first data analyst job a world  \nof opportunities will open up for you you can grow \nyour skills into a senior data analyst or become  \na freelance data analyst or what i eventually \ndid quit my job as a data analyst the single  \nbest decision in my life was quitting my job \nas a data analyst you see becoming a freelance  \ndata analyst gave me the resources to quit my \njob and pursue a completely different career  \ncreating my own brand while traveling the world \ndo not subscribe to my youtube channel i'm 100%  \nserious if you're looking for advice and tips on \nhow to become a data analyst and how to build a  \ndata analyst career for the rest of your life then \ni would recommend subscribing to Luke Barousse  \nwhat up nerds as he makes way better videos than \nme but if you view being a data analyst as a  \nstepping stone to creating a life you want your \ndream life whatever that might be for you then  \nyou might want to subscribe as i share my personal \nlessons on this journey from a 9-5 to a dream life  \nwatch this video next to learn what made me \nquit my six-figure job to start youtube cheers\n",
