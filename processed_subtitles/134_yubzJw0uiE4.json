  "text": "ever wonder if there's an easier way to\ncomplete transactions without having to\ndeal with online wallets banks and\nthird-party applications well it's\npossible thanks to blockchain here's\neverything you need to know about\nblockchain imagine four friends jack ted\nsam and phil meet up for dinner after\nthey're done jack pays the bill and all\nof them decide to split the expense\namongst each other now on the next day\nwhen phil sends his share to jack via\nonline money transfer the transaction\ngoes through without a hitch then ted\nand sam send their respective shares to\njack but their transactions don't go\nthrough the failed transaction cites\nsome issues at the bank that's when jack\ncomes to know about the many ways a bank\ntransaction could fail it could be due\nto technical issues at the bank one of\ntheir accounts were hacked daily\ntransfer limits being exceeded and\nsometimes additional charges like\ntransfer charges associated with\ntransferring money to solve these\nproblems the concept of cryptocurrency\ncame into existence cryptocurrencies are\na form of digital or virtual currency\nthat run on a technology known as\nblockchain thanks to blockchain\ncryptocurrencies are immune to\ncounterfeiting don't require a central\nauthority and are protected by strong\nand complex encryption algorithms and in\na market of more than thousands of\ncryptocurrencies like litecoin ethereum\nz cash and so on one reign supreme\nbitcoin now let's go back to our\nprevious example and have phil ted and\nsam send jack two bitcoins each as their\ncontribution to the previous night's\ndinner let's assume phil ted and sam\nhave three bitcoins in reserve while\njack has five first phil sends two\nbitcoins to jack a record is created in\nthe form of a block the transaction\ndetails between them is permanently\ninscribed in this block this record also\nholds the number of bitcoins each of the\nfriends own so after phil's transaction\njack has seven bitcoins while phil has\none following this sam and ted send two\nbitcoins to jack a new block is created\nfor each of these transactions these\nblocks hold the transaction details as\nwell as how many bitcoins sam ted and\njack have in reserve these blocks are\nlinked to each other as each of them\ntakes reference from the previous one\nfor the number of bitcoins each brand\nowns this chain of records or blocks is\ncalled a ledger and this ledger is\nshared among all the friends which acts\nas a public distributed ledger this\nforms the basis of blockchain so what\nhappens when phil has only one bitcoin\nleft and he tries to send two more\nbitcoins to jack the transaction will\nnot go through this is because all his\nfriends have copies of the ledger and\nit's clear that phil has only one\nbitcoin left his friends will flag this\ntransaction as invalid a hacker will not\nbe able to alter the data in the\nblockchain because each user has a copy\nof the ledger the data within the blocks\nare encrypted by complex algorithms all\nof this is made possible with the help\nof blockchain technology blockchain can\nbe described as a collection of records\nlinked with each other strongly\nresistant to alteration and protected\nusing cryptography now let's have a\ncloser look at the bitcoin transaction\nbetween jack and phil and find out how\nit works every user in the bitcoin\nnetwork has two keys a public key and a\nprivate key the public key is an address\nthat everyone in the network knows of\nlike an email address of a user the\nprivate key is a unique address that\nonly the user has knowledge of something\nlike a password first phil passes the\nnumber of bitcoins he wants to send to\njack along with his and jack's unique\nwallet address through a hashing\nalgorithm all of this is part of the\ntransaction details these details are\nencrypted using encryption algorithms\nand using phil's unique private key this\nis done to digitally sign the\ntransaction and to indicate that the\ntransactions came from fill this output\nis now transmitted across the world\nusing jack's public key with this the\nmessage or transaction can be decrypted\nonly by jack's private key which only\njack has knowledge of different\ncryptocurrencies use different hashing\nalgorithms while bitcoin uses the\nsha-256 algorithm ethereum which is also\na famous cryptocurrency uses one known\nas ethash\nthis transaction and several other\nsimilar ones are taking place all around\nthe world these transactions are\nvalidated and then added block by block\nthe people who validate these blocks are\ncalled miners\nfor a block to be validated and added to\na blockchain miners need to solve a\ncomplex mathematical problem the miner\nwho solves this first adds the block to\nthe blockchain and is rewarded with 12.5\nbitcoins the process of solving the\ncomplex mathematical problem is called\nproof of work and the process of adding\na block to the blockchain is called\nmining\nwith this phil and jack's wallets are\nupdated just like every person in the\nnetwork who has completed a transaction\nnow that you know about blockchain and\nits important concepts time for a small\nquiz what is the concept of blockchain\nthat ensures data cannot be altered by\nany of the users within the network a\npublic distributed ledger b\nproof of work\nc\nproof of stake d\nhash encryption let us know what you\nthink is the right answer in the\ncomments below three lucky winners will\nget amazon gift vouchers details are\nmentioned in the description below let's\nhave a look at how walmart uses\nblockchain to provide its customers with\nbetter service walmart was facing\nproblems in delivering quality products\nto its customers they were facing a high\nreturn rate and large amounts of refunds\ndue to their products bad quality they\nwere unable to determine the point of\nfailure in the supply chain which\nstarted from farm to storage to\ntransportation to processing all the way\nto the customer then walmart adopted\nblockchain technology with blockchain\nthe quality of the goods at each step\nwas permanently inscribed within a block\nfor example when a customer flags a\nproduct as damaged it can be correctly\nidentified where the product got damaged\nin the entire supply chain thus helping\nwalmart to identify the problem areas\nand fixing them and this is just one of\nseveral ways blockchain is used in real\nlife applications can you think of any\nothers let us know in the comments down\nbelow that's all for now thank you for\nwatching and stay tuned for more\n",
