  "text": "a lot can be achieved through a simple\nprompt but to guide a large language\nmodel to get to a specific and more\naccurate output you need to up your\nprompting game one of the greatest ways\nto do so is by showing the language\nmodel certain examples examples of how\nyou want the work to be done these\nexamples are called shorts and in this\nvideo we'll talk about uh three\nprompting techniques zero short one\nshort and finally few short prompting\nand show you how it will improve your\nprompting skills also guys do not forget\nto check out our other videos in this\nprompt engineering 101 series on this\nnote let's\nstart the difference between zero short\nprompting one short prompting and few\nshort prompting lies in how many example\nyou show to the model this is how zero\nshort prompting looks like it is the\nmost basic form of prompting it simply\nshows the model a prompt without\nexamples and ask it to generate a\nresponse\nhow does the model answer this so the\nmodels like chat GPT are tuned to follow\ninstructions and are trained on large\namounts of data they are capable of\nPerforming some tasks zero short let me\nshow you an example if you ask the large\nlanguage model what is 2 + 2 it will\nanswer you correctly as it has been\ntrained to do so similarly if you give\nthis particular prompt the output will\nbe neutral here we didn't provide the\nmodel with any examples whatsoever of\ntext alongside this classification uh\nthe llm already understands what\nsentiment is and how to compute it\nthat's how zero short capabilities of\nllm\nwork one short prompting takes uh the\nconcept of zero short to a step further\none short prompting is when you show the\nmodel a single example the model then\nuses this single example to understand\nand generate text accordingly here's an\nexample let's say you want to translate\na sentence from English to to French so\nyou put the prompt and instead of\ntelling the model explicitly to\ntranslate it to French you just give a\nsimple example and look the llm\nautomatically translates the sentence\ninto French this is how one short\nprompting\nworks now zero short and one short\nprompting give remarkable results but\nthey can still fall short on more\ncomplex tasks Here Comes few short\nprompting as a name suggests few short\nprompting involves providing a few\nlabeled example in the prompt let me\nshow you how this works for this prompt\nlet's say you want the answer to be\neither true or false but if you only put\nuh this prompt the model will give you\nuh this specific answer and not the\nresponse you want this shows that there\nis a need for more advanced prompt\nengineering now let's try the same\nprompt with a few examples we put in the\nprompt with multiple examples and look\nat the answer now F short prompting has\nmuch more impact moreover as this table\nshows F short has a higher overall\nperformance and accuracy than zero short\nand one short prompting combined not\njust that the performance improves as we\nincrease the number of examples in the\nworld of generative AI prompting has\nbecome a bridge between large language\nmodels and practical language based\ntasks so next time use these prompting\ntechniques add examples and improve your\noverall interaction with large language\nmodels these techniques will get more\ncomplex task done easily and with higher\naccuracy so guys that's all we had for\nyou in today's video uh if you liked it\ngive it a thumbs up and uh do subscribe\nto our channel for more interesting data\nTech content See you in the next video\nbye\n",
