  "text": "learning objectives\nby the end of this lesson you will be\nable to\nexplain the iot architecture and\nframeworks describe the iot\ninteroperability as design\nconsiderations and discuss\nindustry-aligned use cases\niot device architecture\nthere are four layers in the device\narchitecture the base layer consists of\niot devices\nthis includes all the components\nlike sensors with the ability to sense\ncompute and connect other devices\nlet's move on to the second layer which\nis the iot gateway or aggregation layer\nthis layer significantly aggregates data\nfrom various sensors these two layers\nform the definition engine and they set\nthe rules for data aggregation next\nlayer is based on cloud is called\nprocessing engine or event processing\nlayer it has numerous algorithms and\ndata processing elements that are\nultimately displayed on a dashboard\nthis layer basically processes the data\nobtained from the sensor layer the last\nlayer is called the application layer or\napi management layer\nit acts as an interface between\nthird-party application and\ninfrastructure the entire landscape is\nsupported by device managers and\nidentity and access managers\nwhich are useful for security of the\narchitecture\niot reference architecture next let's\nlearn about the various layers in iot\nreference architecture device layer\nthe device layer is the main component\nwhere there are various devices like\nsensors that are interconnected some\nexamples are bluetooth connected via\nmobile phone and zigbee via zigbee\ngateway the other devices include the\nraspberry pi that's connected to the\nethernet via wi-fi this is directly\nconnected to the communication layers\nwhich are part of the second layer\ncommunication layer the communication\nlayer or gateway layer has\nrest protocols\nand other application level protocols\nboth layers are tightly coupled and\ngenerate enormous amount of data\nnow the bus layer or aggregation layer\nacts as a message broker it forms a\nbridge between the data and the\ncommunication layer for the sensors\nthis is an important layer for three\nreasons it supports an http server and\nor a mqtt broker\nit aggregates and combines\ncommunications via gateway and it\nbridges and transforms data between\ndifferent protocols\nthe next layer is the event processing\nand analytics layer which drives data\nand provides transformation to the data\ngenerated\nit provides the ability to do event\nprocessing the data is stored in the\ndatabase\nthe client layer is used to create a\nweb-based engine to interact with\nexternal apis\nthis can be fed into the api management\nsystems this layer helps create a\ndashboard and provides a view of the\nanalytics and event processing\nthis layer helps communicate with\nsystems outside the network using\nmachine and machine communication\nso we've seen the comprehensive iot\nreference architecture with various\ncomponents rule engines interfaces and\nsecurity systems embedded\ncross-functional architecture is\npossible using device manager that\nprovides a single platform for remote\nmanagement the device manager\ncommunicates with devices through set\nprotocols device management uses device\nmanagement agents and is responsible for\nthe remote management of software\nthe identity layer has the capabilities\nof cyber security including policy\ncontrol and oauth 2 token instruments\nother capabilities include identity\nservices xacml pdp and directory of\nusers eg\nldap iot reference frameworks there are\na lot of frameworks for iot setup but\nthe most common is the iso\n30141 and it provides commonly used\nvocabulary reusable designs and best\npractices for any developer to design an\napplication it also has many secure\napplication standards that derive the\nmaximum benefit for the organization and\nreduce the risks\niot standardization and design\nconsiderations\nthere are a number of iot standards\nand these are evolving over time some of\nthe key ones are m2m that is a machine\nto machine service layer that can be\nembedded in hardware and software to\nconnect devices\ncontiki which is an open source\noperating system for low-cost low-power\niot microcontrollers light os a\nunix-like operating system for wireless\nsensor networks\nrandom phase multiple access\nthis is a proprietary standard for\nconnecting iot objects\nthe last one is sig fox a proprietary\nlow power low thorough put technology\nfor iot and m2m communications\niot interoperability challenges\niot maturity comes with several\nchallenges specifically pertaining to\ninteroperability and interfacing the\nreasons are coexistence of multifarious\nsystems\ndevices sensors equipment etc that\ninterchange location time dependent\ninformation in varied data formats\nlanguages data models constructs data\nquality and complex interrelationships\nmultivision\nsystem designed by manufacturers over\ntime for varied application domains\nmaking formulation of global agreements\nand commonly accepted specifications\nvery difficult\nnew things that get introduced and that\nsupport a new unanticipated structures\nand protocols existence of low-power\ndevices which need to exchange data over\nlossy networks and may have minimal\nlikelihood or accessibility for a power\nrecharge in months or years\niot design considerations when you\nchoose an iot solution you need to\nconsider several factors\nlike its wireless capability\nfunctionality\ninteroperability\nsecure storage immediate boot capacity\ndevice categorization bandwidth\ncryptographic control\nand power management the design\nconsiderations should be a mix of the\nestimated average of all these\ncomponents and index to balance the user\nrequirements you also need to set up a\ndispute resolution mechanism in case of\nfailure in the long run\niot device architecture network and\ncloud there are four stages of\nintegrating the different iot processes\nstage 1 network things wireless sensors\nand actuators\nstage 2 sensor data aggregation systems\nand analog to digital data conversion\nstage 3 the appearance of edge i.t\nsystems stage four analysis management\nand storage of data as these stages are\nevolving the devices the network and the\ncloud application must be leveled\nequally in ecosystem for better\nstability and security the iot\narchitecture is a combination of things\ndevices platform and sensors with data\nstage 1 of an iot architecture consists\nof networked things typically wireless\nsensors and actuators stage 2 has\ninternet gateways and data acquisition\nsystems that includes sensor data\naggregation systems and analog to\ndigital conversion in stage 3 edge it\nsystems perform pre-processing of the\ndata before it moves to the data center\nor cloud finally in stage 4 data center\nand cloud is where the data is analyzed\nmanaged and stored on traditional\nbackend data center systems\nfundamentally we need to have a\nfunctional scalable available and\nmaintainable architecture if these are\nnot supported then architecture is not\nuseful now let's look at the three\narchitecture areas of iot one the client\nside iot device layer two operators on\nthe server side iot gateway layer\nand three a pathway for connecting\nclients and operators iot platform layer\nthese three layers interface with each\nother on a data synchronization front\nand pathway to generate more data from\nvarious applications the feasibility of\nthe layers depends on their application\nlet's now differentiate between\ncentralized and decentralized iot\narchitectures the centralized\narchitecture is a hub and is managed\nfrom one point whereas the decentralized\none is based on the use case\nthey do not help in industrial iot\nsolution the centralized architecture is\nassociated with cloud architectures in\nwhich a central hub provides a series of\nback-end services to smart devices\nin decentralized architecture there are\nmany scenarios that require autonomous\ncommunication between smart devices and\nan iot topology without the need of\nessential hub the centralized systems\nhelp in event processing and whereas\ndecentralized systems operate more of\npeer-to-peer messaging the decentralized\nauditing is one of the essential\nfeatures that decentralized architecture\nuse case i have smart farming\nuse case smart farming iot design this\nuse case addresses the design\nformalities using iot iot design is an\nessential part of the navigational\necosystem smart farming requires precise\narchitecture and components that help\nbring benefits to the farmers the\nvarious factors that determine the iot\ndesign are data cost efficiency and\nproduct quality the efficiency and\ndurability of the ecosystem help the\nfarmers plan their harvest and sow based\non the climatic conditions using the\nsensors and geospatial location data so\nbe precise any farmer needs to\nunderstand the fundamental design that\ncan help run the ecosystem\nsmart farming is useful as it helps the\nfarmer to predict conditions and sow\ncrops with less cost and utilize\nautomation capabilities to have such\nsystems you need to purchase the right\nhardware which can monitor the accuracy\nof data and quality of the sensor once\nyou have these systems you can benefit\nmore from farming there are four things\nyou need to integrate for smart farming\nfirst is a data engine smart farming\nshould have a robust data processing\nengine that can act as the brain and\nhandle data processing storage and lead\nto efficient output\nthe second is hardware you need to\nensure that the hardware is durable and\neasy to maintain hardware self-fixing\nalgorithms is even better the third\naspect is mobile access\nthis is possible using a smartphone\nalong with offline or online mobile\napplications to enable all three\nprocesses you need cloud infrastructure\nwith the edge layer this iot system can\nenable smart farming for any crops in\nany geographical location let us look at\nanother use case on using sim cards to\nmonitor sugar level in a diabetic\npatient diabetes management is a\nrecurring concept where the patient has\nto check the blood sugar at regular\nintervals in the traditional way he has\nto go to the physician lab or he has to\nhave his home blood glucose monitoring\nsystem iot can help create a system with\nthe blood glucose data will be\ntransmitted remotely via smartphone and\na sim embedded in it\nidentifying the necessary and right\nhardware is one of the crucial steps of\ncreating such a system you need to\nchoose the sensors for your device or\ncreate a custom one which fits the\nglucometer this can be a sim card the\nnext step is to ensure that the quality\nof your sensors is good and has seamless\nintegration with the system finally make\nsure that the data monitoring happens in\nreal time with high accuracy now when\nthe hardware landscape of this ecosystem\nis ready you need to set the software\nthen first it is crucial that you have\nsoftware with software pair algorithm\nfor service management to enable this\nprocess you need cloud infrastructure\nwith edge and finally a smartphone to\nwork with the devices and sensors\nkey takeaways now that you have\ncompleted this lesson you should be able\nto explain iot reference architectures\nand frameworks describe the iot interop\nability and its design considerations\nand finally discuss industry-aligned use\ncases\nhi there if you like this video\nsubscribe to the simply learn youtube\nchannel and click here to watch similar\nvideos to nerd up and get certified\nclick here\n",
