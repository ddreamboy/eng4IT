  "text": "i'm going to start this video with two\nassertions assertion number one any\nexcel data analyst that wants to\ndifferentiate themselves in the job\nmarket needs to acquire predictive\nanalytic skills\nassertion number two acquiring those\npredictive analytics skills is probably\nfar easier than you might think this\nvideo is a short guide for any excel\ndata analyst to start the journey of\nacquiring predictive analytic skills\nthat can be used in a broad range of\nbusiness scenarios and only requires\nbasic excel skills just in case you're\nwondering i want to be crystal clear on\nthis point to use the techniques i'll be\ntalking about in this guide you do not\nneed advanced math skills you don't need\nto write super complicated formulas and\nyou don't need to write any vba code the\ntools and techniques that i will be\ncovering in this guide are accessible to\nany motivated excel data analyst\nregardless of role and background so\nlet's go ahead and get started what i'm\ngoing to do is i'm going to flip over to\npowerpoint and we're going to talk about\nthe first idea that we need which is\nwhat are the two families the two\ngeneral types of predictive analytics\nthat we can implement using trustee old\nexcel\nso the first thing that you need to know\nwhen you get started with predictive\nanalytics is that there are two general\ntypes or two general families of\npredictive analytics techniques the\nfirst of which is called regression and\nregression is pretty simple essentially\nit is a predictive model a predictive\nanalytics technique where the thing that\nyou're trying to predict is a number\nit's a measurement so think of anything\nwith a decimal point in it height weight\nsales\nyou name it anything that you can\nmeasure in the business world that is a\nregression predictive analytics problem\nand not surprisingly there are many many\nscenarios where regression is useful for\nexample revenue forecasting\nthat revenue has a decimal point in it\nthis is a regression problem marketing\nmix so how much should we spend on\ndigital advertising versus television\nversus radio advertising marketing makes\nalso decimal points right money has a\ndecimal point in it progression problem\nprice and cost modeling\ncustomer lifetime value regression is\nwildly useful and arguably\nregression techniques are some of the\nmost common if not the most common\npredictive analytics techniques\nin use\nand that includes by the way not just in\nthe business world but also in the realm\nof science now in the business world you\nactually see that regression is useful\ndon't get me wrong it's absolutely\nuseful however what you tend to see is\nthe next family has more prominence than\nyou see in science and that is\nclassification classification is a\npredictive analytics technique where\ninstead of trying to predict a number\nwhat you're trying to do is predict a\nlabel so for example male or female as a\nlabel bronze silver or gold as a label\nanother way to think about this is that\nclassification\nis all about predicting a state your\nstate of being are you male or female\nthe state of your\nolympic medal bronze silver or gold as\nopposed to predicting a measurement as\nopposed to predicting a number like you\nin regression now in the science world\nclassification isn't nearly as prominent\nas in the business world because as you\nmight imagine the number of scenarios\nwhere you're trying to predict a state\nin business analytics is extremely\ncommon some scenarios where this is\ntypically done is for example fraud\ndetection let's say you work for a\ncredit card company what is the\npredicted state of this authorization is\nit good is it a legitimate transaction\nor is it fraudulent churn prevention\nwe're trying to figure out the future\nstate predict the future state of a\ncustomer are they going to leave our\ncompany for somebody else that's known\nas churn conversion modeling is somebody\ncoming to our website what is our\nprediction for their future state are\nthey going to be a customer are they\ngoing to spend money with us or are they\ngoing to abandon their shopping cart on\nour website and lastly warranty claims\nas well often these are a fraud scenario\nis this a legitimate warranty claim or\nnot that sort of thing so not surprising\nclassification is super super useful\nthese are the two general families of\npredictive analytics regression\nand classification and in the next slide\ni will be covering techniques for both\nregression and classification that you\ncan use inside of excel and once again\nlike i said previously but it bears\nrepeating the techniques that i'll be\ntalking about are very easily\nimplemented now there's a couple things\ni should mention before i move on to the\nnext slide and they are\none time series forecasting is out of\nscope and if you don't know what time\nseries forecasting is don't worry about\nit because obviously it doesn't matter\nhowever if you're familiar with time\nseries forecasting that is a very\nspecialized form of regression and it's\nnot covered in this particular video\nhowever you can do time series\nforecasting in excel using\nout-of-the-box functionality if you're\ninterested in having me maybe create a\nvideo about that just let me know in the\ncomments below the video and next up i'm\ngoing to be\na little heretical with this two-family\nframework here of regression and\nclassification i'm going to talk about\ntwo techniques that i would argue are in\nthe regression family well actually i'm\ngoing to talk about one technique that's\nin the regression family and then one\ntechnique that's in the classification\nfamily and some people might disagree\nwith me on that and that's totally cool\nthis is my video so i'm going to be a\nbit heretical so i'm going to talk about\nfive techniques in this video two\ntechniques in regression three\ntechniques in classification and to kind\nof put these in some sort of context for\nyou as you begin your predictive\nanalytics journey i'm going to use a\nscale i'm going to use a spectrum of\nquote-unquote easy and quote-unquote\ndifficult and just so you know this is\nnot a hard and fast spectrum it's very\nqualitative and it's just something i\nmade up for the purposes of this video\nso that you get some sort of sense of\nthe five techniques which ones are the\nmost easy to use generally speaking and\nwhich are more difficult to use so the\nthings to consider along the spectrum of\neasy to difficult are three items that\nyou want you want to keep these in mind\nso first up is the implementation in\nexcel as i've said everything in here\ncan be implemented using like tables of\ndata common functions\nand out of the box excel functionality\nso overall all of the implementations\nfor these five techniques in excel are\neasy however\nsome are a little bit more involved than\nothers and i will talk about that next\nup is the conceptual requirements for\nyou\nnow as i said you're not going to need\nto learn any complicated math you're not\ngoing to need to learn any coding to do\nthese things however to use the\ntechniques effectively you have to learn\nthem and some of the techniques have\nmore things to learn than others any\nprofessional can do it because i've\ntaught all these techniques to people\nbefore anybody can do it and then lastly\nand maybe most importantly is this idea\nthat\nif you use a predictive analytics\ntechnique and you find something\ninteresting in the business and you want\nto communicate it to decision makers\nwhat are the conceptual requirements on\nthem\nthe decision makers to understand what\nyou have done that's also another thing\nto consider in fact arguably it might be\nthe most important thing to consider\noverall so all three of these things are\ngoing to be wrapped up together along\nthis spectrum as they talk about each\nindividual technique so first up let's\ntalk about regression and this is where\ni'm getting a bit heretical with the\nframework here because i'm putting\nprocess behavior charts in the\nregression bucket and a lot of people\nmight disagree with me on that and\nthat's okay but let me explain to you\nwhat these things are these are\nvery powerful graphical techniques for\nlooking at numeric data over time for\nexample maybe your sales figures or call\nvolume in your call center and then it\nallows you to create predictions based\non the historical data in a very\nspecific kind of way and let me give you\nan example let's say that you're you\ncreate a process behavior chart around\ninbound calls to your customer service\ncenter and let's say you've got\n12 weeks of data and each week is\nessentially one data point which is the\ntotal volume of calls coming in each\nweek\nthe chart would allow you to create\nbased on the historical data an estimate\nof the range of values for calls that\nyou would see roughly\neighty percent of the time and that\nwould give you a range let's say on\naverage over the 12 weeks you got a\nthousand calls a week and the process\nbehavior chart tells you 80 of the time\nyou're going to get between 900 and 1100\ncalls per week since that is a\nprediction that is also a number that's\nwhy it's in the regression camp now the\nreason why this thing is so cool is that\nit is\nsuper super easy to implement in excel\nno fancy calculations really at all you\nget a chart as the end result and then\nyou interpret the chart the conceptual\nrequirements on you to use process\nbehavior charts is exceedingly simple it\nis so so easy to use these charts and\nnot surprisingly as well using the\ncharts to communicate with your decision\nmakers is also extremely easy this is\none of my favorite\nfavorite predictive analytics\nand business analytics techniques bar\nnone next up the second technique that\nwe're going to talk about in the\nregression space\nis linear regression\nthis right here if you're not familiar\nis probably the single most used\npredictive analytics technique in the\nworld bar none\nthat includes both the business world\nand the science world so linear\nregression can be done in excel\nusing the analysis tool toolpak add-in\nand it provides you a\nuser interface that allows you to click\nthings around and set everything up and\nit runs the linear regression for you so\nthat part is easy the reason why linear\nregression is sitting right here in this\nqualitative spectrum is because it is\nmore difficult for you to use as a data\nanalyst and it's also more difficult to\ncommunicate the findings to your\nbusiness stakeholders as compared to\nprocess behavior charts now once again\nyou don't need to know any complicated\nmath excel does all the math for you\nhowever you have to learn how to\ninterpret the models and you need to\nlearn how to evaluate whether the models\nare legitimate and once you've done\nthose two things you then have to then\ncommunicate properly the findings of the\nmodel to the decision makers and those\nare all more complex more complicated\nthan process behavior charts now the\nupside is linear regression is also\narguably more powerful than process\nbehavior charts because if no other\nreason process behavior charts only work\nwith a single type of data for example\nyour calls coming into your call center\nwhereas linear regression can work with\nmultiple pieces of data at the same time\nso here are two very powerful predictive\nanalytics techniques these are awesome\ntechniques easily implemented in excel\nand any professional can do it sorry to\ninterrupt the slideshow i know you're\nprobably really disappointed about that\nbut i did want to mention that if you're\ninterested in learning more about the\ntechniques that i'm talking about in\nthis video check out the description\nbelow the video there'll be links to\nother youtube videos where you can learn\nmore about these techniques also if\nyou're liking the content if you think\nit's useful if you wouldn't mind helping\nme out with the youtube algorithm and\njust smash that like button that would\nbe awesome that just tells the youtube\nalgorithm that this is good content and\nthat other professionals like yourself\nmight benefit from watching the video\nlet's go ahead and get back to the\nslideshow and talk about classification\nas promised there are three techniques\nthat i'm going to talk about in the\nclassification space and the first one\nis market basket analysis also known as\nassociation rule mining this is\nwickedly powerful stuff now once again\nthis is a bit heretical there would be\nmany folks who would argue that market\nbasket analysis is not a\nclassification technique doesn't matter\nlet me tell you what you can do with\nmarket basket analysis market basket\nanalysis allows you to take a table of\ndata and you can take one of the columns\non your table of data and you can tell\nmarket basket analysis hey i want you to\ndetermine\neverything else using all the other\ncolumns of data which combinations\nof these columns of data over here are\nhighly associated with this thing that\ni'm holding steady over here what i'm\nholding between these two fingers right\nso for example let's say that you work\nin the grocery store industry and you're\nhighly interested in knowing what other\nproducts in the grocery store when\npurchased are highly associated with\nmayonnaise let's say\ni'm just totally making this up right\nmayonnaise so not surprisingly probably\nthings like bread and cheese and mustard\nand all the things in the united states\nthat we use to make sandwiches because\nmayonnaise is a very common thing we put\non sandwiches but notice it doesn't have\nto be a grocery store product this could\nbe whether or not a customer is going to\nconvert to paying yes or no it could be\nwhether or not a particular feature and\na software product is going to be used\nyes or no so you'll notice that that\nbecomes a state prediction a label\nprediction exercise so market basket\nanalysis is awesome the great news is\nthat it is really super simple to\nimplement in excel using the solver\nwhich is an ad in excel that so the\nimplementation is quite easy the\nconceptual requirements for you as the\ndata analyst are also quite easy and\nmost importantly once again\nthe findings that come out of market\nbasket analysis are wildly easy for\ndecision makers to figure out to\nunderstand and let me give you an\nexample so let's say that you use market\nbasket analysis\nand the thing that you are\nholding over here the thing that you're\ntrying to predict let's say you're in\nthe hr space is whether or not an\nemployee is going to quit and then what\nyou do is use all the other columns of\ndata and say which of these behaviors of\nemployees are most highly associated\nwith an employee acquitting and what you\nget back is a metric called lift and\nwhat it tells you is how many more times\nlikely is this particular employee to\nquit based on the other characteristics\nso let's say for example 2.3 times more\nlikely to quit think about that for a\nsecond how easy is that for anybody to\nunderstand if employee xyz has these\nthree characteristics over\nhere they're 2.3 times more likely to\nquit than somebody else\nsuper super easy this is powerful stuff\ni use market basket analysis all the\ntime and i know how to use more\nsophisticated predictive analytics\ntechniques however i tend to use market\nbasket analysis mainly because one it's\nsuper easy it's very effective and i can\ncommunicate findings to stakeholders\nvery very easily next up is something\ncalled naive bayes and i don't expect\nyou to understand or know what naive\nbayes is don't worry about it this is\nsomething that will resonate with you\ni'm pretty sure naive bayes is a classic\nclassification technique for\nimplementing spam filters\nright so an email comes in to your\nhotmail or your yahoo or your gmail\naccount whatever it might be and\nautomatically gets sent to your junk\nfolder or your spam folder that is\nusually some form of naive bayes or\nmaybe something a little bit more\nsophisticated but in the old days they\nwere definitely based on this naive\nbayes classification technique so\nthere's another way to predict state yes\nor no is this piece of email\nham quality email good stuff legitimate\nemail or spam stuff i don't want in my\ninbox so naive bayes is also very easily\nimplemented not as easily implemented as\nmarket basket analysis so it's a little\nbit more difficult it requires a little\nbit more\nknowledge on your part to use it\ncorrectly and then communicating the\nfindings is also a little bit more\ncomplicated to stakeholders however\nyou'll notice that conceptually in this\nframework here of difficulty it is still\neasier than linear regression and then\nlastly we have another\nsuper super common predictive analytics\ntechnique\nwhich is known as logistic regression\nnotice they both have regression here\nhowever the thing to remember is that\nlogistic regression is designed to\npredict yes no\nstates positive negative broad legit\nlegit fraud excuse me a statistician\nmight argue with me and say dave\nlogistic regression isn't a\nclassification technique but it's okay\nfor our purposes this allows you to\npredict states now out of all five of\nthese this one is the most difficult\nbecause you have to implement logistic\nregression yourself\nusing the solver for whatever reason\nmicrosoft has decided not to put\nlogistic regression in the analysis\ntoolpak unlike logistic or linear\nregression which is in the analysis\ntoolpak so you have to implement it\nyourself it's not super difficult but it\nis most the most difficult thing out of\nall of these five to implement with\nusing out of the box excel it also has\nthe most difficult conceptual\nrequirements on you\nbecause of the way the model works\nand because you also have to implement\nthe things yourself the calculations\nyourself and then lastly\ninterpreting a logistic regression model\nfor business stakeholders\nis the most difficult of these five\ntechniques and i won't go into the\nreasons why that's they're a little bit\nmathy it doesn't really matter for this\nvideo however all five of these\nare eminently approachable to any\nmotivated excel data analyst\njust maybe start with these two up here\nand then move down\nas you need process behavior charts gets\ngets what you need done great use that\nif market basket analysis gets what you\nneed done great and then maybe you move\nto linear regression if you need\nsomething a little bit more powerful in\nprocess behavior charts and it might be\nthat you don't need anything more\npowerful than market basket analysis in\nthe classification space so if you're\nstill watching the video right now i'm\nassuming that you're interested in\nlearning more about how you can apply\npredictive analytics in your work using\nexcel so i'll put up a couple of my\ntutorial videos right here and here and\nyou can learn how easy it is to\nimplement predictive analytics in excel\nand up your data analysis game that's it\nfor this video until next time please\nstay healthy and i wish you very happy\ndata smoothing\n",
