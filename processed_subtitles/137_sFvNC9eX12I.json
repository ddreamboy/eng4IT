  "text": "hey guys welcome to this live session by\nIntel apart so in this session we'll be\nlearning about big data tools and\ntechnologies so I hope in the last\nsession you would have understood and\nyou would have learned something from\nthe hadoop session\nhow do pico system session so in this\nsession we'll be looking at the top big\ndata tools which are available as well\nas we learn few things about big data as\nwell so about big data analytics on the\nfive V's of big data so after learning\nthat we'll be looking into the top tools\nafter that I'll summarize them and once\nthat is done we will come to the end of\nthis session so I hope you learned a lot\nfrom this session let's get started so\nfirst the agenda we'll start off with\nwhat is Big Data\nthen we look into the challenges after\nthat we'll look at the big data tools\nand then I'll summarize them in the most\nused big data tools and finally I will\nshow you how to get started with Big\nData if that is what you want to do in\nyour career first what is Big Data so\nbefore starting off with something\nyou'll have to understand what it is\nright so like that you'll have to us\nunderstand what is Big Data\nso before understanding the buzzword Big\nData what is data first of all so data\nis an individual unit of information\nthat is defined as figures of facts and\nstored for later processing so data is\neverything so let's say if you want to\ncall someone you have their name and\nadjacent to that you will have their\nnumber so that is Theta you know whom\nand what is the number to call them so\nyou have the precise amount of\ninformation so you can do a task same\nthing comes with data if you have\ncertain information which you can use to\ndo a certain task so there are three\ntypes of data one a structured on a\nsemi-structured and one is unstructured\nstructured are basically relational\ndatabases so they are they have complete\ncells and rows with even data so let's\nsay you have an excel sheet with FiOS\nand five columns with data filling up it\nall so it's not just FiOS it can be any\nnumber of rows the columns are defined\nand also one you get data for everything\nso it is structured as a record next a\nsemi-structured it can be both\nstructured ants and it can have other\nof data as well so if you take Jason it\nin Jason it's not required that you\nshould have a certain set of columns\njason is basically a file in which you\ncan store any type of data in any order\nwhich you want same goes with CSV and\nXML and finally unstructured data\nunstructured data is everything it can\nbe the PDF doc file an image video audio\nfile a PPT presentation so right now the\nPPD I'm presenting you is an\nunstructured data the images which I've\nused if this is this is collected and\nput together in a storage system for\nanalyzing then again that would be\nunstructured data so badly you see and\nstructure data the most in social media\nsites so if you go in there you will get\nvideos audios image files everything\nover that text ok so this is Theta now\nas you understood data now let's see\nwhat is big data so big data is a\ncollection of extremely large data sets\nthat may be analyzed computationally to\nreveal patterns trends and associations\nespecially relating to human behavior\nand interactions so it is basically a\ncollection of a lot of data so let's\nremove these words likes large data sets\nit's basically a huge amount of data\nwhich is analyzed to see if there is\nsomething useful inside of that data so\nthat's why we need big data and then\ncoming to black box data so it captures\nvoices of the flight crew for recordings\nof microphones and earphones and\nperformance information of the aircraft\nso why do they have this black box in a\nflight so whenever the flight is going\nto crash or something so to get the\ninformation of what exactly caused that\nso let's say a flight has been\nmalfunction and it has written erosion\nso now they'll go and retrieve the black\nbox to check the information in that so\nwith that information from black box\nthey can conclude what exactly happened\nin the flight and cost that particular\ncrash so again this is a example of pick\na table and third one is the you biggest\none right now so everybody will be using\nsocial media sites\nyou are using a social media site to\nwatch this live which is YouTube which\nis a video streaming platform you have\nFacebook whatsapp Instagram Twitter\nsnapchat and so many others so Google\nPlus is already gone so you can exclude\nthat so there is LinkedIn Pinterest yeah\nso that is reddit there is 4chan\nactually there are so many social media\nsites and every single social media\nsites job is to make you communicate\nwith others so obviously you will add\nimages videos you'll have text you will\nhave audio files you'll have every kind\nof information so this all will be\ngathered together and this will be sent\nto\nlet's take Instagram so you're posting\nvideos text you are posting audio files\nyou're posting as well as images so all\nof these data will be pushed into\ninstagrams storage so now they'll have\nto segregate it right and so that they\ncan analyze it so social media data is\nalso a form of big data so similar\nexamples power data stock exchange data\nsearch engine data transport data so I\nthink you can easily relate them by\nhaving these examples social media data\nand black box data ok now so this is one\nof the important concepts you should\nunderstand while learning big data so I\nthink you understood understand what\nexactly is big data right now so it is\nbasically large amounts of data in which\nyou are trying to gather some useful\ninformation from so there may be a lot\nof information but not every single line\nis useful some lines can be out of value\nas well\nso you have to find exactly what is the\nmost useful things and take it out so\nthat you can use it for your benefit so\nalso in Big Data the five most important\nthings are the five beasts to make sense\nof the huge amount of data you should\nbreak them down break them down into\nfive parts the velocity volume value\nvariety and velocity so let's see what\nexactly do these mean first velocity\nvelocity I think you know what the\nvelocity is so velocity refers to the\nhigh speed at which data flows in from\nmultiple sources such as machines\nnetworks social media mobile phones IOT\ndevices any kind of devices\ncetera so there is a massive and\ncontinuous flow of data for example on\nGoogle every day there are three point\nbillion searches made if there are three\npoint billion searches made three point\nfive billion searches made then there\nare three point there are so many people\ntrying to search something so whenever\nsomebody is trying to search something\nsome data will be yeah so there will be\nsome data coming in so obviously\nwhenever some data is flowing so the\namount of data which is flowing at the\nsame time is very very high so that is\nvelocity so let's say you have set up a\nbig data analytic system in which data\nis coming from various sources let's see\nso from social media from an IOT device\nfrom a a local machine which you have so\nthere are so many different inputs for\nyou so the data flow is continuous so\nwhen data flow is really fast when the\nvelocity is really high you will have to\nhave a very highly efficient system so\nthat you can analyze every single gb of\ndata which is coming in so next is\nvolume so volume means the huge amount\nof data obviously the highest amount of\ndata if the velocity is very high the\ndata size also will be very high because\na lot of data will be coming in to\ndetermine volume the size of the data\nplays a crucial role the data may be\nvery small and a lot of data may be\ncoming in sometimes the one single file\ncan be very big and it can be uploaded\njust one or two for few minutes so it\ndepends so and that plays a crucial role\nwhen dealing with big data it is\nnecessary to consider the volume of it\nthis is one of the important things you\nwill always have to consider the size or\nthe volume of it for example in the year\n2016\nyeah so the estimated global mobile\ntraffic so right now every every single\nperson is having a mobile phone in their\nhand so uploading images to social media\nsites uploading images to your own cloud\nor something so the estimate the total\nestimate per month itself is 6.2 billion\ngigabytes of data every single month so\nnow you can understand the amount of\ndata come coming into the internet\neverything\nnext is variety so we already discussed\nthis the three types of data structured\nsemi-structured or unstructured the\nthing is it is not that you get only one\ntype of data either structured or\nunstructured or semi structured in some\nsystems you will get all three types of\ndata and you'll have to figure out what\nkind of data is what and then you have\nto segregate them and then analyze them\nit also refers to the heterogeneous\nsources so that is heterogeneous in the\nsense various different sources with\nwhich do not have any connection variety\nis basically the arrival of data from\nvarious new sources both inside and\noutside of the enterprise so I think you\ncan understand this point it is so you\ncan also see that image there is a video\nthere is an audio file there is a mail\nalso there is a document so all these\nare different varieties of data so every\nvariety of data will be coming in will\nalso have to take that into account\nbefore setting up a big data system the\nfourth one is you voracity so this\nrefers to the inconsistencies and\nuncertainties in data it is not that\nalways you get the most perfect data so\nevery single data set will have an\nunnecessary data set so the thing is\nthere will be unnecessary columns so you\nwill have to figure out which is messy\nwhich is messy data and remove it so\nthat you can get a more accurate output\nyou can get more quality in that so you\ncan see data can sometimes get messy\nhence quality and accuracy of the data\nare difficult to control so the thing is\nyou have to control it so that your\noutput your trend your information which\nyou take out of that large amount of\ndata is actually useful data in bulk can\ncreate confusion whereas less amount of\ndata can convey half or incomplete\ninformation so a huge amount of data\ncannot be easily interpreted but even\nthough there is a less amount of data\nand if it is incomplete you cannot take\nanything out of it so the thing is your\ndata shouldn't be incomplete you should\nmake sure that your data is complete and\nwithout any inconsistency and finally\nand one of the most important thing is\nvalue so you have to figure out whether\nthe information which you are going to\nget out of this data set whether it is\ngoing to give you value or not your\ncompany value or not if this particular\ndata set is of no value to your\ncompany's growth then the\nno use of analyzing it wasting time on\nit so you'll have to figure which data\nset is needed for you which is not so\nthe bulk data of having no value is of\nno good to the company unless we turn\ninto something useful\ndata is of no use are important but it\nneeds to be converted into something\nvaluable to extract information that's\nwhat I said if it is not useful then\nthere is no need to extract information\nyou have to make sure that it is\nimportant only then you can extract and\nit can be used for your company's growth\nhence we can state that value is the\nmost important V of all the files so\neven though there is a lot of data\ncoming in the volume of data is very\nhigh variety of data and there are no\ninconsistencies if that particular data\nset is of no value to your company then\nthere is no use of considering all these\nother four V's okay so we've seen the\nfive E's now let's see what is big data\nanalytics so big data analytics is the\nprocess of examining big data to uncover\ntrends hidden patterns statistical\ninformation and performing large\ncalculations using that data so I've\nalready explained to you multiple times\nthe same thing because while explaining\nBig Data I've also told Big Data is used\nto uncover trends and hidden patterns\nfrom a large amount of data so today\nalmost every major commercial\norganization is using big data analytics\nbecause without big data analytics still\nnot exactly know which is the customer\nbase they have to target what exactly\nthey have to do and so there's a lot of\nthings for marketing as well so let's\nsay a product is coming into the market\nand they want to market that product to\na particular segment let's say teenagers\nso they'll have to find out which area\nteenagers are mostly using for example\nwhich application the teenagers are\nmostly using let's say you know it's all\nmostly using Instagram so now this\ncompany will decide to market its\nproducts on Instagram so to get that\ninformation that is whether Instagram\nhas a lot of teenagers who are using\nthat particular app so big data\nanalytics has actually made a direct\nimpact on the company's profits\ncompany's customer retention targeted\npublicity and ads for his advertisements\nand then customer satisfaction as well\nas the company's understanding of what\nexactly the customers want if\nonly the company use what the customers\nwant their profits will increase for\nthat they need big data analytics so the\nnext is why is it important so big data\nanalytics is an essential part of\neverybody's life right now because as I\ntold you everything any company does\nthat so first\npersonalized customer experience so if\nyou open Amazon and you just want to\nlook cameras and gadgets so you are\nsearching for gadgets a lot but when you\nsearch for gadgets a lot your\nrecommendations will be filled up with\nother gadgets which you may like so\ninstead of showing gadgets if Amazon\nshowed you beauty products will you like\nit you obviously won't that is basically\nthe personalized customer experience\nnext is showing of only in relevant data\nso again this comes under that category\nso instead of showing you a product\nwhich you will never buy we can show you\na product which you might buy so that\nwill increase the chances of that\nproduct to be sold third one targeted\nadvertising so again this will come\nunder the same first two category but it\nis a little different here you pay money\nto push your advertisement to that\nparticular user may buy that product\nbecause he has searched about this\nproduct a lot fourth will search on\ntechnical analysis so research you might\nknow so let's say if even if it is\nscientific research or patent research\nyou will need big data analytics to\ngather the required data to check if\nthis particular project has been done or\nthis particular patent has been already\ntaken so these are some reasons why big\ndata analytics is important and there\nare so many other reasons as well so\nwe've seen this next yeah so challenges\nphased in big data analytics first SQL\nso structured query language it is used\nto communicate with a database and is\nconsidered to be the standard language\nfor our DBMS so you provide a query\nstatement to get the name of all the\ncustomers in a table so your statement\nwill be directed to the our DBMS server\nwhich has that data then you will get\nthe output back so this is how basic SQL\nworks now what are the problems with it\nfirst one hardware failure all those\nstorage capacities of hard drives\nincreased massively that is so obviously\nyou first we had floppy disks then we\nhad CDs then we got pen drives then we\ngot smaller SD cards so the devices are\ngetting smaller the storage space is\ngetting bigger and that even though that\nhappens access speech that is the rate\nin which the data can be read so for for\nnames that is easy let's say you want to\nread a million names so that will\nobviously take a lot of time\nso in that case sometimes the hardware\nmight fail and then the second one is\ncombining data most analyses require to\ncombine data in some way to join\nmultiple tables so data read from one\nparticular hard drive or disk may be\ncombined with another disk and it can be\ncombined with multiple disks and this\nparticular thing is very dangerous or it\nwill it is very time consuming if there\nare separate disks this is a challenge\nfor distributed systems now what is the\nsolution for this\nso let's look into that so first for a\nsolution for hardware failure well we\nstart using many pieces of hardware the\nchance for one to fail is far behind and\nthis might this is the result data loss\na common way of avoiding data loss is\nthrough replication the replication\nbasically means having multiple copies\nof data in multiple locations or\nmultiple drives so that even if one even\nif data is lost in one particular drive\nyou can get it from another tribe so in\nthis event of failure there is another\ncopy available so this is what exactly\nHadoop does Hadoop has and file system\ncalled HDFS Hadoop distributed file\nsystems which has multiple copies of\ndata whenever one drive fails it gets\nthe data from another distributed system\nfor combining data we have MapReduce\nMapReduce is a programming model so this\nis used to map and reduce and it uses\nkey and value pairs so MapReduce has a\nbuilt-in reliability and interface where\nthe mixing of map and reduce mid videos\noccurs so if you have a lot of data\nMapReduce can help you to reduce into a\nsmaller amount of data so that you can\nuse it to so it will combine the data\ninto a smaller column or a smaller set\nof data which makes it easier for you to\nanalyze data so I just\nto give this information even though\nthis information will be given in the\nhadoop session as well also in other big\ndata sessions provided by Intel apart\nnow let's get into it and look into the\nbig data tools which are really popular\nso first for data storage and management\nthere are multiple tools so Apache\nCassandra is one of the most highly used\ntools then MongoDB I'm pretty sure you\nwould have known either one of these\nnames\nso first Apache Cassandra this is a\ndatabase which is widely used to provide\nan effective management of large amounts\nof data\nit supports replication and also offers\na very good fault tolerance and low\nlatency so basically Apache Cassandra is\nnot exactly a traditional database type\nof system but this this a database which\nis basically so let's say you have large\namounts of data then you can go with\nApache Cassandra so it is very effective\nto manage it and then comes MongoDB it\nisn't no sequel database it's a non\nrelational database basically so it is\nalso open source it is cross-platform\ncompatible it is compatible with so many\ndifferent software's and platforms and\nframeworks it is ideal for the business\nthat needs fast and real-time data for\nfast decisions as we know MongoDB is\nreally fast because it is no sequel even\nthough it is no sequel it has inbuilt\nfeatures so that you can easily query\ndata out of MongoDB tables so that's why\nit is really fast and also it is very\nvery required for real-time data\nso basically no sequel databases are\nused for real-time data meaning for\nexample if you go to Amazon you will\nhave filters to choose a particular\nbrand or within a particular range of\ncost or this type of product so all of\nthat filtering is done on a no sequel\ndatabase so it is ideal for the users\nwho want data driven experiences so this\nis basically for applications which is\ncompletely data driven again it is for\napplications like e-commerce\napplications Amazon flip card a web so\nall of these applications and then\ncoming to others so there is hey Hadoop\nand then my sequel so I'm pretty sure\nyou know my sequel is an O\nsource relational database it is mainly\nused for a structured data and it uses\nbasic SQL to query its tables and then\nhow do Hadoop is the most popular Big\nData - I don't need to tell it to you if\nyou even just type in Google the most\npopular Big Data tool you will get\nHadoop so Apache Hadoop software the\nlibrary is a big data framework so HDFS\nis used for storing data in that HDFS as\nI already told you it is Hadoop\ndistributed file system and it is mainly\nused for storing data in a distributed\nplatform so that you have replications\nof this same data so it also allows\ndistributed processing of large data\nsets across clusters of computers so to\nmake it simpler let's say you have four\ndifferent computers and one master\ncomputer\nnow you have uploaded a large data set\ninto the master computer and that match\nthe computer will split the data set\ndata set into four different smaller\nparts and provided to the four different\nclient computers so that the task is\ncompleted four times faster than\nanalyzing it in a single computer so\nthis is how Hadoop works and then it is\ndesigned to scale up from single server\nto thousands of machines so you can also\ndo it on a single machine you can also\ndo it on the organs of machines which is\nconnected under it okay so we've seen\nthese four tools\nnext comes data cleansing so as I told\nyou there might be inconsistencies there\nmight be uncertain data so to remove\nthat you need a data cleansing tool so\nthese two are the top data cleansing\ntools which I could find open refine and\ntry factor Wrangler first in open refine\nit is a powerful tool to work with messy\ndata or under its inconsistent data it\nis used for cleaning and transforming it\nfrom one format to another it can also\nyou can also actually easily explore\nlarge data sets using it and also you\ncan upload so once you clean your data\nyou can upload that data into a central\ndatabase let's say you can also upload\nit to a cloud database and AWS database\nor an Azul database or even to wiki\nlater a central database and then\nfactor bang Wrangler so this is used to\ndiscover structure clean and rich and\nalso publish data of all shapes and\nsizes so again this is for data\nwrangling you can also do data cleansing\nso this also supports large data volumes\nand also it also supports connecting\nwith cloud and other deployment that is\non-premise setup finally it is a\nconnected desktop application so\nbasically it is a desktop application\nwhich you can connect with other\ndeployment options and also this is to\ntransform data for downstream analytics\nand visualization so this provides you\nthe ability to make your data clean so\nthat that data can be used for\nvisualization and analytics okay so this\nis for data cleansing next for data\nanalysis we have Apache spark we have\nfive and we have hadoop mapreduce so we\nalready seen MapReduce what exactly\nhappens there so again you will see that\nonce more facilitates processing by\nsplitting petabytes of data into smaller\nchunks as I told you this is used for\naccessing and processing data which is\ntold in HDFS what it does is it splits\npetabytes of data into smaller chunks so\nthen it can be processed really fast the\nlogic is executed on this server by the\ndata already resides so the thing is\nusing MapReduce you don't need to\ndownload the data first and then process\nit you can run MapReduce on the server\nwhere the data is already available so\nthat it saves a lot of time coming back\nto Apache spark this is again an open\nsource big data to every single Apache\ntool is open source this fills the gaps\nof Apache Hadoop concerning data\nprocessing so spark can handle both\npatched data also real-time data as part\nthis in-memory data processing it\nprocesses data much faster than\ntraditional disk processing so in memory\ndisk processing in the sense it does not\ncopy the data to the hard disk and then\nprocess it it basically gets the data\nstores in the temporary memory processes\nit and pushes it it doesn't store\nanything that's why it is really faster\nthan Apache Hadoop and then comes hi-5\nagain this open source as\ntold you every single Apache a big data\ntool is open-source it's an open-source\nsoftware big data tool it allows\nprogrammers to analyze large sets of\ndata on Hadoop so it is mainly used for\nquerying and managing large data sets\nwhich is available in Hadoop so these\nare some data analysis to spark hive and\nMapReduce and finally we look into data\nvisualization tools so these two are the\nmost popular in the industry tableau and\npower bi so tableau is again a bi\nanalytics tool it is used mainly for\nvisualizations and to create bi AR\ntrends so you can see the main thing\nwith tableau is you can extract data\nfrom any source you can connect it to a\ndatabase you can extract information\nfrom Excel from a PDF file from an\nOracle database from a cloud provided\nlike Amazon Web Services as you GCP so\nit's a tool for visualization in the BI\nindustry it has really powerful\nvisualizations which is also interactive\nso as well as you can also connect it to\nHadoop so tableau can be connected to\nHadoop so it is a really useful feature\nin tableau and then it comes power bi\nagain this is a business analytics tool\nwhich is a bi tool power bi is provided\nby Microsoft and power bi does not\nrequire anything else you just have to\nknow a little bit of SQL and it is more\nthan enough to start off with it so\nagain it provides interactive\nvisualizations and ba capabilities and\nalso they have made it so simple that\nanyone can start off with power bi again\nit can connect with Excel it can connect\nto cloud databases it can also connect\nto compromise databases and data\nwarehouses so these are the top two\nvisualization tools okay now let's just\nquickly look into the Hadoop ecosystem\nI'm pretty sure this has been taught in\nthe afternoon session but I'm just going\nto roughly I'll tell you why exactly is\nHadoop ecosystem very popular and why it\nis free as well so first for Hadoop\necosystem is open source and you have\nevery single tool which you need to\ncreate a complete big data analytic\nsystem over here you have\nhadoop mapreduce for processing you have\nhive for analytics query you have mahute\nand spark for machine learning and data\nprocessing you have Kafka and storm for\nstreaming you have another you have\npatches park for in-memory data flow\nengine which is basically for in-memory\ndata processing you have a no sequel\ndatabase you can use HBase instead of\nMongoDB you can have you can use Susi\nfor scale scheduling the tasks you can\nuse solar and Lucene for searching and\nin texting and then you can use Pig it\nis a scripting language which you can\nuse in the Hadoop ecosystem you have\nzookeeper which is basically used to\nmanage and coordinate every single other\nbig data tool in the Hadoop ecosystem\nyou also have Hadoop yarn and Hadoop\nHDFS\nyarisis resource management tool it is\nagain it is used to manage all the other\nhow do echo system tools HDFS it is the\nstorage so you can see it is at the\nbottom any data coming in unstructured\nsemi-structured structure it will first\nhit how to fetch the office it will\nstore then it will move the data to\nwhichever part of how to pick which\nsystem you want to yeah so this is the\nHadoop ecosystem I think the morning\nsession would have covered this\nthoroughly okay now let's just quickly\nsummarize the most use big data tools so\nthe first most used big data tool is\nHadoop Hadoop is used everywhere in\nevery single company which ever uses big\ndata analytics\nHadoop is really popular it is available\nin almost every single cloud platform\nand so Hadoop for visualization tableau\nis the most popular for a no sequel\ndatabase MongoDB is really popular\nbecause it can integrate with any any\nback-end tool it can integrate with any\nthird-party tool and then comes Apache\nspark Cassandra ok so there are some\nhonorable mentions as well I wanted to\nsay so there is Amazon redshift which is\na data warehouse which is really good\nfor analytics there is Amazon quick site\nwhich is for visualization again it is\nreally fast and quick for cloud data\nwarehouses and then you have data Lake\nin Azure that is\nreally good and then also you have\nmultiple tools so many different tools\nare available you have even an Apache\nyou have so many different tools in\nvisualization again you have click sense\nyou have sigh since you have so many\ndifferent tools so you'll have to do a\nlot of research before choosing what\nexactly you need but I would strongly\nsuggest these fight tools over here if\nyou want to start off with big data\nHadoop MongoDB spark Cassandra and\ntableau ok guys we've seen this next I\nwanted to show you is if you want to\nstart off a career if you want to have a\ncareer in big data how do you get\nstarted with it ok so first let me\nintroduce you to something first of all\nwe in telepods provide you a lot of free\nresources first we provide you blocks\nand also a YouTube channel with so much\nof free content so much of free content\nwe have complete Big Data courses as\nwell so coming to in telepods block we\nalready have so I have already have\nopened over here I'll just close this so\nyou can see here until I become slash\nblog so you
