  "text": "if you're trying to break into cyber\nsecurity and you find that popular\ncertifications like cissp require you to\nhave five years of experience then this\nvideo is for you in this video I'll take\nyou through the certification path that\nI would personally follow today if I was\ntrying to break into cyber security\nthese are certifications that don't have\nany experience requirements and also\nhave the best bank for your buck in\nterms of career progression career\nopportunities but also in terms of\ngrowing and developing new skills in\norder for you to become a cyber security\nprofessional you can call me your next\nguy I've been working in cyber security\nfor about two decades when I started my\ncareer I didn't have any career mentors\nso I decided to create these videos in\norder to help you to avoid making the\nsame mistakes that I made and to be the\nmentor that I've never had the first\ncertification that I recommend is\nusually a certification that will take\nyou through the definition and basic\nconcepts in cyber security and for that\nI have two recommendations for you the\nfirst one is certified in cyber security\nfrom ist2 isc2 are the providers for for\nthe CIS SP certification they are known\nfor their high quality and they are\nhighly recognized by employers I really\nrecommend this certification because it\ndoesn't have any prerequisite background\nof knowledge it doesn't assume that you\nknow anything and also the good thing is\nboth the training and the certifications\nare absolutely free for now so I\nrecommend that you don't waste any time\nand go straight into doing this\ncertification alternatively you can do\nCompTIA Security Plus company Security\nPlus is a really popular certification\nas I said it takes you through the\ndefinitions and the basic concepts in\ncyber security it's a nice little\nintroductory certificate that I\nrecommend for anybody starting out in\ncyber security now before you go on and\nask me do I need the network plus before\ndoing Security Plus or do I need CCNA\nthe answer is no I discussed this in\ndetail in this video so if you want to\nargue with me about that so I recommend\nthat you do so in that video now the\nsecond thing that I recommend you do\nafter you do your basic definition\ncertifications it's penetration testing\ncertifications even if you don't plan on\nbecoming a penetration tester I think\ndoing mutation testing certifications\nare super underrated in the industry\nbecause they make you really understand\nthe cyber attacks really really well\nthey give you a much better perspective\non later on when you implement controls\nand detections and response like I see a\nhuge difference between cyber security\nprofessionals who have done a little bit\nof pen testing and those who have never\ndone pen testing you can see that in\ntheir recommendation you can also see it\nin their confidence when they talk about\nhow to defend against cyber attacks now\nfor me personally when I was trying to\nbreak into cyber security I really\nwanted to be a penetration tester I\nwanted to be a full-time hacker the only\nproblem is back then the only\ncertification and training that was\navailable to me was the oscp from\noffensive security the issue with that\ncertificate is it's not beginner\nfriendly and it's very very frustrating\nespecially if you're someone who doesn't\nhave any experience in cyber security or\npenetration testing now fast forward to\ntoday and the good news is we have\ne-learn security which is the first\ncertificate that I recommend in\npenetration testing Elon security Junior\ncertified penetration tester or the ejpt\nis an absolutely amazing introduction to\npenetration testing and the reason why\nI'm a big fan of it is because it's\nfully lab based you get to practice what\nit actually means to do a cross-site\nscripting attack or an SQL injection\nattack or a Brute Force attack it will\ngive you those Hands-On skills you get\nto practice and you get to understand\nthis Concepts at a deeper level and at\nthe same time it doesn't have that\nmassive massive commitment that you need\nto make if you want it to be a full-time\npenetration tester and again before some\nof you ask me what about the certified\nethical hacker from EC Council I\nabsolutely don't recommend doing the\ncertified ethical hacker because it's\njust about memorizing a bunch of\nConcepts and doing a multiple choice\nexam now the third type of certification\nthat I recommend once you've done your\nbasic foundational certificates and\npenetration certificate the third one\nwould be certifications focused on\nstopping cyber attacks so this is the\nrealm of a security Operation Center or\na cyber security analyst the certificate\nthat I recommend you do is the CompTIA\nSSR plus and just be mindful that if\nyou've done CompTIA Security Plus before\nand now you're doing DSLR plus this is a\nplus is a little bit harder than\nSecurity Plus it's a challenging\ncertifications it needs more time\ncommitment it needs more studying but\nit's not an impossible certificate\nespecially for someone who've done let's\nsay Security Plus and then ejpt once you\ndo this as a plus this concept overall\nmake sense everything is tied in\ntogether the certificate will take you\nthrough the basic techniques that we use\nto defend against cyber attacks the\ncontents are absolutely amazing for the\ncertificates and it can prepare you to\nwork in a security Operation Center or\nto work as a cyber analyst now another\noption for you if you don't want to do\nthis as a plus is from e-learn security\nthat's the Elon security certified\nincident responder and again I'm a big\nfan of this because it has a Hands-On\nlab component and now a bonus tip before\nwe finish this video that I want to talk\nabout is sense certifications for those\nof you who don't know the Sans Institute\nis a massive provider of cyber security\ntraining one of the oldest providers of\ncyber security training highly respected\ntraining and certification provider if\nyou do a sense training then you can do\nthe GX certification the only problem\nwith the Sans Institute is the price\nusually the cost of their training\ncourse which is a five-day training\ncourse sometimes it's fall but the cost\nis something like eight thousand dollars\nwhich I understand it's a lot of money\nthe good news is there are ways to get\nthe same training and certification for\na lot less money I talked about this in\ndetail in this video and I'll put a link\nto this video in the description box\nbelow but for those of you who went and\nwatched that video I talk about the work\nstudy program so if I was just starting\ntoday in cyber security I will apply to\nthe work study program literally any\nchance possible in fact I personally\nhave done that for three years in a row\nup until I was accepted into one and the\nbeginner certification that I recommend\nfrom Sans is none other than the Sans\nthe ACT certified incident Handler the\ngcih is an absolutely phenomenal\ncertificate specially for those starting\nout in cyber security it takes you\nthrough the most common types of attacks\nit takes you through the hacker\ntechniques tools and it also teaches you\nhow to protect against those attacks it\nhas a little bit of a lab component and\nthe training is absolutely fantastic\nemployers know and respect sense\ncertifications and if you're wondering\nwhat to do after you've done the\ncertifications that I recommended the\nnext step for you would be to specialize\nchoose a cyber security specialization\nand go deep into it I created a playlist\nof cyber security specializations I've\nliterally created a video about each\ncyber security specializations I talked\nabout what the day-to-day job looks like\nthe pros and cons and I've also talked\nabout training and certifications that\ncan help you work into that\nspecialization so I'll see you there\n",
