  "text": "\"Where to begin in hacking, which \nresources are the best to use,  \nwhat programming language to learn, how \nto practically work in cybersecurity,  \nwhich studies to pursue, and what profession \nto aim for—In Today's video we'll talk about  \nall that and more. By the end of this video, \nyou will know the steps to follow and have a  \nlearning plan for your future in the field. In \nfact, there is no one-size-fits-all path that is  \nstable and applicable to everyone, unlike a cake \nrecipe that everyone can follow step by step.\nSo, I will help you choose a path that suits you,  \nrather than providing one that is not fitting. \nIt's important to know that I provide advice  \nbased on my few years of experience in \nthe field, but it's nothing compared to  \nthe scope of cybersecurity. The only thing I \nam sure of is that you can progress with or  \nwithout a diploma. I learned on my own through \nmy mistakes and my passion for the field. So,  \nI will base my advice on my experience and what I \nwould have done if I had to start all over today.\nThere are two things that will consistently be \nyour allies in your journey towards learning  \nhacking: firstly, practice. you progress \nonly by doing, even by making mistakes  \nthrough practice. Secondly, one or more \nguides along the way will always be useful.\nThere are 4 skills in cybersecurity and \nthey are programming, computer networks,  \noperating systems, including Linux, and \nall the related skills. Your starting  \npoint should be one of these four pillars, \nand you will see that no matter what you do,  \nyou will come across one or the other, \nsometimes even intertwining. It's not  \nvery important which one to start with; do \nwhat feels right for you. Keep in mind that  \nthere is no magical path. everything you learn \namong these pillars will be useful regardless,  \nand you won't waste your time. You \nwill consistently gain experience.\nTo help you choose, I'll give you the example \nof my personal case. I started with programming,  \nmore precisely, I got a guide on Visual \nBasic.NET, installed Visual Studio,  \nand fried my brain to create my first \nprograms. They were horribly bad,  \nand any programmer would have mocked me, but it \ndoesn't matter. The goal is to start and practice.\nAfter learning Visual Basic, I learned \nthe C language, through online courses.  \nThis language is important to understand the \nfunctioning of systems because it requires  \ngreater proximity to RAM. I downloaded Linux \nvirtual machines to learn C programming and  \nalso how Linux works. This multi-pronged \nlearning approach was very effective. Then,  \nI learned web languages like PHP and \nJavaScript to create and modify my website.\nKeep in mind that learning doesn't mean \nbecoming an expert. Learning means being  \nable to master the subject within \nthe scope of your projects and goals.  \nThat's why you don't have to learn \nprogramming languages from A to Z,  \none after another. No one does that. Remember that \npractice, time, and guides are your best allies.\nThe best way improve your skills in hacking is \nto have projects. For example, I wanted to know  \nhow viruses work, how they hide in a system, and \nmore generally, how hackers operate. So, I wanted  \nto create my own parental control software, \namong other more or less whimsical projects.\nWith web languages, I wanted to build my website \nto share what I've learned, and once in the web,  \nyou're never far from networks and systems. I \nrented a Linux server to host the site, learned  \nto use it, learned Linux commands, and learned \nsystem and network administration. I wanted  \nto focus on web security to protect my site and \nfuture clients' sites. So, I needed to understand  \nthe functioning of certain network protocols \nlike HTTPS, DNS, ARP, IP, and many others.\nIn the end, it brings us to the last pillar, \nwhich is transversal to all others. Here,  \nyou'll find skills in languages, \nespecially English, social engineering,  \nand knowledge of standards, \nreferences, and laws in the field.\nYou need to find your own path. Now, you \nknow everything you need to go fast and far:  \na guide a project, and time to \npractice gradually. If you start now,  \nyou'll always be one step ahead \nof those who start tomorrow.\nYou don't need a budget of 1000 dollars, you don't \nneed a diploma. If you have an internet connection  \nand a computer, that's enough. You don't even need \nto spend ten hours a day learning. Just start.\nIf you want to start with programming, study \nalgorithms and data structures. If you don't  \nknow which language to start with, choose \nPython because it's one of the most popular  \nand essential languages. I'll provide all \nthe links to start in the description,  \nincluding a website that gives you all the basics \nof a programming language in a single source code.\nIf you want to start with networks, the best \nplace in my opinion is professor messer. learn  \nthe basics of the OSI model and TCP/IP. Learn \nthe functioning of certain protocols like HTTPS,  \nDNS, ARP, IP, and more. You can move on \nto vulnerabilities in these protocols and  \nWi-Fi security. Tools like Wireshark will help \nyou understand the TCP/IP model in practice.\nIf you want to start with systems,  \ndownload and install a Linux distribution like \nKali Linux. Learn the architecture of Linux,  \nthe terminal, and commands. You can use \nsecurity tools or shell scripts in your  \nlearning. and you can learn all this in this \namazing website that's called linux journey\nIf you want to start with related skills, \nstrengthen your social engineering skills.  \nLearn to think like an attacker by discovering \nvarious scenarios and attacks or scams that exist,  \nall with the appropriate defense measures. \nIf you work in the field later on,  \nyour goal will be to fix all that. \nThere are always subdomains that  \npotentially involve other subdomains, \nbut you don't need to know all of them  \nbefore starting. You will naturally \ncome across them in your learning.\nIn the end, a hacker is, above all, a person \nwho knows the details of computers. Knowing  \ncomputers translates into many jobs \nand situations. A coder, for example,  \nis a programmer who will try to find flaws \nin a code or build antivirus software.\nA tester is an expert in cyber-attacks who will \nattack a company at its request to protect it.\nA hacker is also and above all, a person \nconcerned about ethics and laws. They have  \nversatile skills useful to many companies. \nThis is just a fraction of the possibilities,  \nnot to mention the future of the Internet \nof Things, artificial intelligence,  \nor bioinformatics. Cybersecurity jobs \nof tomorrow don't even exist yet.\nNever forget that the true hacking community \ndoesn't want people trying to hack others.  \nBeing a hacker is helping others, and not putting \non the Anonymous mask to ask how to hack your ex.\nBeing a hacker is also being in constant \nlearning, even ten years after starting;  \nyou will still learn. Cybersecurity is an exciting  \nand endless field. You've already made \nthe excellent choice to learn hacking,  \na field that will take you far with prized and \nindispensable skills. That's all I wish for you.\nIf you're still a bit lost, that's normal. \nyou can do it. My goal is to help you reach  \nyours. So, if you have any questions, don't \nhesitate. Thanks for watching and peace.\"\n",
