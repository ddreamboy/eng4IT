  "text": "hey guys welcome to this full course on\nRPA UI path this full course video will\ncover the core topics of RPA UI path RPA\nis in demand and highly growing field\nuipath is the leading robotic process\nautomation tool for large scale end to\nend automation for an accelerated\nbusiness change it provides solution for\nbusiness to automate rouin office\nactivities so if you're interested in\nRPA and tools like uipath then you're in\nthe right place this video will help you\nunderstand the concepts of RPA UI path\nso here is the list of topics\ncovered we'll first understand what is\nRPA then look at the top 10 reasons to\nto learn robotic process automation we\nwill see some of the realtime RPA\nexamples followed by which we will look\nat the comparison between RPA tools like\nUI path automation anywhere and blue\nprism proceeding further we will\nunderstand what is uip paath and then\nlearn how uip paath is installed in the\ndevice then we will see the uip tutorial\nfor beginners followed by which we will\ngo through uipath orchestrator uipath\nrobotic Enterprise framework uipath web\nAutomation and then we will see Excel\nAutomation in uipath as to how Excel is\nused in uipath lastly we will see RPA\ndeveloper salaries skills resume roles\nand\nresponsibilities and finally uip paath\ninterview questions that will help you\ncrack the interview with ease I'm sure\nyou're excited to begin with full course\nbut before we begin make sure you have\nsubscribed to our YouTube channel and\nclicked on the Bell icon so you never\nmiss an update from Simply learn so\nwithout wasting any further time let's\nget started this is Jim he is an\naccountant in a multinational company he\nhandles several invoices and other\nFinancial records like monetary\ntransactions liabilities checks and\nledgers on a daily basis one of his\ntasks is to copy all the relevant\ninformation from these invoices such as\nhas the name of the company invoice ID\nand data processing into a spreadsheet\nand mail the sheet along with other\nFinancial reports to a superiors by the\nend of the day as any prompt employee he\ntransfers all the information to the\nsheet attaches the reports and sends\nthem over to his boss via email every\nday but over a period he starts finding\nthis task to be timeconsuming and\nrepetitive frustrated Jim looks for a\nway to reduce the time and effort it\ntakes to complete the task and voila he\nstumbles across robotic process\nautomation AKA RPA using robotic process\nautomation he builds a simple bot that\nextracts information from several\ninvoices into an Excel sheet attaches\nall the necessary Financial reports and\nsends them over to his superiors via\nemail at a specific time every day so\nwhat exactly is robotic process\nautomation robotic process automation\nRPA is the use of software with\nartificial intelligence and machine\nlearning capabilities to handle high\nvolume repetitive tasks that previously\nrequired humans to perform some of these\ntasks include addressing queries making\ncalculations maintenance of records and\nPerforming transactions there are\nseveral misconceptions about RPA RPA is\nnot a humanoid robot it does not have a\nphysical form and no resemblance to\nhumans RPA cannot replace humans or\nreplicate human cognitive functions it\ndoes not have a brain of its own and\ncannot perform logical or critical\nthinking as humans do the working of RPA\nincludes four crucial phases one the\nplanning phase typically involves\nGathering the processes to be automated\nidentifying the test objects and\nfinalizing the implementation approach\ntwo the development phase includes the\ncreation of automation workflows as per\nthe agreed Plan Three deployment and\ntesting is a vital phase since it\nuncovers any unexpected outages and\nensures a bug free product four lastly\nthere's the support and maintenance\nphase which ensures that the product is\ncontinuously updated with smooth\ndeployment across the user base to meet\nthe objectives of RPA tools are used\nthese RPA tools are software\napplications that can configure tasks\nand automate them some of the popular\nRPA tools in the market are uip path\nautomation anywhere blue prism work\nFusion Pega and Redwood among others\nwhen it comes to Quality RPA ensures\nconsistent error-free output leading to\nreduced operational risks this in turn\nimproves customer satisfaction in the\narea of delivery RPA can help decrease\nthe average handling time and this\nenhances the customer experience and\nensures 247 business continuity with\nrespect to cost according to nascom\ndomestic businesses can reduce the cost\nby up to 65% through RPA it offers a\nhigher Roi by driving positive returns\nwithin quarters as opposed to years\nother advantages of RPA include reduced\ntraining costs minimal utilization of it\nresources and easier software migration\ntoday many domains in Industries like\nBanking and finance it integration\nprocesses Human Resources insurance\nagencies marketing and sales and\ncustomer relationship management readily\ndeploy RPA RPA service adoption has been\nshowing tremendous growth since 2016\nand will continue to increase Beyond\n2020 according to McKenzie's research\nknowledge and work automation could have\nan economic impact of5 to7 trillion by\nthe year 2025 it will impact more than\n230 million knowledge workers which\nconstitute 9% of the global Workforce\nany company which is labor intensive\nwhere people are performing high volume\nHigh transaction functions stand to\nbenefit the most with RPA adoption\nboosting their capabilities and and\nsaving money and time now that we've\ndiscussed what RPA is and isn't here's a\nquestion for you which of the following\nis not an RPA use case one email query\nprocessing two data extraction three\nimage recognition four payroll\nprocessing give it a thought and leave\nyour answers in the comment section\nbelow RPA offers the ability to automate\nbusiness processes quickly and easily it\npaves the way for digital transformation\nby placing automation tools at the\nuser's disposal so what are you waiting\nfor get certified and become an RPA\ndeveloper to build a bright future in\nthe field of automation 10 reasons why\nyou should learn\nRPA but before jumping into it let me\ngive you a brief insight into what\nexactly RPA\nis now uh do you remember the time you\nEd the digital calculator in maybe your\nCalculus class it made it so so much\neasier for you to arrive at an\nanswer calculators undoubtedly helped\nyou solve complex mathematical problems\nwhich previously required a lot of time\nand of course doing manual calculations\nhave inherently several\nerrors but does calculation account for\nautomation well no a conventional\ncalculator requires manual input so this\nis partial\nautomation automating the use of a\ncalculator that requires zero human\nintervention is what RPA\ndoes so what exactly is\nRPA robotic process automation is the\nuse of software with artificial\nintelligence and machine learning\ncapabilities to handle high volume\nrepeated tasks that previously required\nhumans now some of these tasks include\naddressing queries making calculations\nmaintening records or even making\ntransactions so why is RPA gaining\npopularity so rapidly and why do\ncompanies and techies have RPA\nprospectives so here are the 10 reasons\nwhy one should learn\nRPA so number 10 fast\nimplementation now getting data entry\nBots up and running goes quickly\nimplementing a new RPA Software System\ncertainly happens much faster than\ntraining a new person\nyou can have these data entry Bots up\nand running in just days in contrast if\nyou wanted to hire a new human employee\nyou'd be taking a lot of time in sorting\nout resumés conducting interviews going\nthrough the entire boring hiring process\nand then finally when you find the right\nperson you'd have to spend time and\nenergy on training them however in case\nof RPA all of this is\ncountered and number nine we have no\ntraining time so now this is an\nimportant one if your process changes\nand the Bots need to learn something new\nyou can either replace them with new\nBots or alter their programming now that\nagain goes much faster than training\nemployees for new tasks in terms of\ncosts training an employee for a new\ntask will pan out to be way more\nexpensive and time\nconsuming next up the Bots will never\nquit now with RPA you don't have to\nworry about employees quitting or\ndealing with the turnover Bots don't\ncare how hard they're working or how\nboring their job is or how repeatedly\nthey're doing the same\ntasks again yes it would be ironic if\nthe Bots got tired software Bots can\nwork all the time 24 hours a day every\nsingle day of the year at 100% capacity\nnow RPA doesn't take holidays it doesn't\nhave sick needs and of course they do\nnot have un productive days at all well\nisn't that a treat to have someone who\nnever retires or decides it's time to\nmove to a different\njob next up minimal it resources\nmaintaining software Bots requires\nminimal it resources in some cases it\ndoesn't it doesn't need to get involved\nat all your RPA systems will be managed\nby the software provider they're\nresponsible for maintenance and up dates\nall of that it completely takes the\nburden off it and saves your company a\nwhole lot of\nmoney Roi is visible now every\norganization wants to quantify their\ngains many of these organizations do not\nknow how they should determine their Roi\nbut when it comes to adopting robotic\nprocess automation Roi is visible it\ndefines a clearer path to demonstrate\nits\nreturns comp problems can be solved now\nas our data sources and analytical\ncapabilities have grown so has the time\nrequired to build various reports\nrobotic process automation system is\nideal to for solution to solve these\ntypes of problems the system stores the\ninformation and it can also remember and\ntransform this information very easily\nthat means this makes you auditable and\nTax\nReady software Migra migration now it's\na fact that software migrations are\ntimec consuming and\ncostly migrating to a new software could\ntake months and cost could turn out to\nbe tens or thousands of millions of\ndollars what's even more frustrating is\nthat at all times certain features and\nfunctionalities which may have\nfunctioned in a particular way in a\nprevious version may not even be present\nin the updated version so RPA helps with\ndata migration with accuracy speed and\ncontinuous updating of\nsoftware RPA has a free tier many RPA\nvendors offer free tiers some of these\nvendors are blue prism automation\nanywhere uip paath among others these\nRPA software vendors are offering High\nRPA software notably UI path with their\nCommunity Edition and work fusion with\ntheir RPA\nExpress this helps lower the total cost\nof ownership\nthere's no rip and\nreplace now RPA doesn't jeopardize an\nemployees job but helps with the growth\nof new jobs to do your work you'll need\nsome additional software yes and virtual\nmachines to deploy fully independent\ndigital Bots but you may not need to re\nrip and replace your existing\ninfrastructures also there's a common\nmisconception that RPA could steal our\njobs well that's not true monitoring and\ncontrolling these Bots are completely\nthe responsibilities of the\ndeveloper as a result RPA does not pull\ndown your existing systems but it\nleverages\nthem lastly popularity and high salary\naccording to glass door the average\nsalary of an RPA developer in the US is\n$77,000 us and in India the beginning\nsalary for an RPA developer is around\n4.65 lakhs\nperim top tier companies like Dell IBM\nAccenture cap gin cognizant among others\nare readily hiring RPA\ndevelopers now with that let's move on\nto the growth projections of\nRPA now looking at the graph here both\nRPA software and\nservices increased by huge amounts\nduring between 2016 and 2020\naccording to McKenzie research knowledge\nand work automation could have an\neconomic impact of 5 to 7 trillion by\nthe year\n2025 it will touch more than 230 million\nknowledge workers which are which\nconstitute about 9% of the global\nWorkforce any company which is labor\nintensive where people are performing\nhigh volume High transaction functions\nwill boost their capabilities and save\nmoney and time with RPA\nnow this is all you need to know about\nwhy one should learn RPA but if you're\nlooking to become a developer let's look\nat some of the job roles and\nresponsibilities RPA developers are\nresponsible for the creation design\ndevelopment and implementation of RPA\nsystems an RPA developer is expected to\nprovide Guidance with process design\ndesign develop test automation FP\nworkflows deploy RPA competence beat\nBots robots or development tools support\nthe implementation of RPA\nSolutions create process documentation\nand also assure the quality of the\nAutomation in this video we will be\nlooking at the robotic process\nautomation example let us consider a\ndiscussion between John and Jamie John\nis very curious and wants to know how\nand where RPA is used in different\nfields Jamie being a developer helps\nLear in understanding the RPA examples\neven if you are curious to know the\napplications of RPA then you at the\nright place so let's get\nstarted the first example is customer\nservice let's look at the problem\nstatement a customer representative must\nunderstand and solve the customer\nqueries carry out the necessary actions\nby switching between the various\nsoftwares and applications and inform\nthe\ncustomer must wait while the\nrepresentative is busy dealing with data\nsometimes asking for information that\nhas already been requested this tends to\ndecrease customer satisfaction and\nextends call\nduration the solution requires\nidentifying frequently Asked customer\nquestions assessing customer\nrepresentative actions in response to\nthose questions and developing RPA\nsolutions to facilitate those\nquestions when several sets of\ninformation need to be coordinated\nacross systems the customer service\nrepresented can launch a bot the bot\ncompletes all actions in seconds with\nthe Press of a button for frequently\nasked questions a dashboard can be\ncreated a customer service\nrepresentative will fill out the\nnecessary information to receive the\nqueries and Bs will use that data in\nmultiple systems to complete the\ntransaction let's look at an example\nconsider a scenario where a company was\nproviding support to the client and the\ncompany was supposed to handle a large\nnumber of calls\napproximately 20,000 calls per month\nwhich required a significant amount of\ntime spent in the support team because\nof the system's complexity and\nExecutives average time was about 10\nminutes as the system was inefficient\nand slow resulting in a poor customer\nservice with the RPS solution the\norganization gained a virtual team that\ncan complete the task in less than a\nminute resulting in a drastic reduction\nin an execution\ntime the RPA B performs the following\ntask loading a comprehensive customer\nprofile obtaining a detailed building\ninformation User preferences and other\nuser information are being updated\nresolving common but simple customer\nissues let's look at the second example\nFinancial\nService Financial Service involves\ncompiling and combining financial\ninformation from various departments and\nstoring the records in a system data is\nmanually extracted from a bank\nstatements to reconcile documents and\nLink them to its forms using detailed\nspreadsheets to complete the reports\nbusiness rely on Excel Legacy software\nand manual labor which is tedious and\ntime\nconsuming solution robots can generate\ninvoices in seconds prompting clients to\npay more quickly RPA in financial\nservices tracks and standardizes and\nvalidates payments process orders and\navoids errors and always on top of\nthings such a disciplined assistant\nmakes the customer's experience less\nstressful adding value to the service\nprovider RPA in finance eliminates the\nneed for Endless email correspondence\nand ensures a smooth payment approval\nprocess matches invoices to responsible\nparties and sets deadline\nreminders automated data entry speeds up\nthe process and relieves human employees\nof huge task this enables precise and\nstruct Ed invoice processing consider a\nfinancial service company that's having\ndifficulty extracting data from\nfinancial documents efficiently and\naccurately in order to generate ratings\nusing RPA company implemented an\napplication that recognized and\nprocessed data this enable decline to\nquickly and cost effectively\nautomate the task performed by RPA bot\nin financial service are investment\nmanagement reconcilation of bank\nstatements organizing the finances\nrecord of accounts receivables and\npayable the third example is HR service\nthis operation includes numerous routine\nsteps such as interview scheduling\nrecord keeping resume screening\ncandidate short listing induction\ntraining and onboarding firing and\nfiring place a significant burden on HR\nand other support functions such as it\nsecurity and Facilities Management\nparticularly for medium and large\nbusinesses while it is expensive to\nbuild a solution that encompasses all of\nthese functions and completes the\nnecessary task for new or departing\nemployees some employees can be sloppy\nwith recording absences vacation or in\ngeneral using the existing absence\nmanagement\nsystem so the possible solution for this\nis RPA can be used to collect and Screen\nresumes and online application forms\nconduct through background checks and\ncompare the information to all the\nrelevant job requisitions this allows\nthe best candidates to be shortlisted\nRPA can be used quickly to create offer\nletters for new employees that are both\npersonalized and accurate can also\nvalidate records by cross-checking data\nsuch as absentees reports Against Time\nlogged in the corporate Network and\nalerting when information is missing or\nin\ninconsistent Talent acquisition team of\na company automated aspects of\nonboarding process for new employees\npreviously the onboarding paperwork was\ncompleted manually by one person\nconsuming a significant amount of\nemployees time that could have been\nspent on more valuable\nwork this type of work that no one wants\nto do day after day the company\nunderstands that an HR department wants\nto provide a digital and straightforward\nexperience the task required a lot of\ncopy and paste activities with the\nimplementation of RPA The Bard completed\nthe onboarding paperwork in less time\nallowing HRS to spend more time on\nCorporate social responsibilities hiring\nTalent initiatives and improving a\ncompany's\nreputation the task performed by RPA BS\nin HR serves are screening resumés\nonboarding of new hires attendance\nmanagement induction and training\nemployment management and Survey\nreport the fourth example is telecom\nservice the Telecommunications industry\ninvolves high frequency of manual\nrepeative rules-based processes all of\nwhich are critical for providing\nappropriate Service delivery thus the\nfoundation of telecommunications is made\nup of process that are highly amenable\nto\nautomation for telecommunication\ncompanies looking to improve their\ncustomer service High reliability and\naccuracy of process outcomes are\nrequired solution the use of robotic\nprocess Automation in Telecom reduces\nerror rates to close to zero improves\ndata quality improves customer service\nand increases operational efficiency all\nwhile contributing significantly to cost\nreduction RPA technology can capture the\nbusiness process task performed by a\ntelecom company's employees based on the\nemploye action a well structured\nworkflow can be generated which serves\nas a foundation for automated process by\nmapping each process step with its\nsignificant cost for manual execution it\nis simple to determine which action\nshould be automated to maximize return\non the\ninvestment consider an example a\ntelecommunications and Media company\ndecided to automate its order creation\nand service removal process to cut cost\nassociated with the company Speed\nBooster discount service and deal with a\nmassive amount of transactional data\nwith the implementation of RPA it it\nbecomes simple to automate the order\nbuild process and service removal\nactivity the task performed by RPA bots\nin Telecom service\nare it checks on the credit and SIM card\nswapping the solution of customer\ncomplaints pting customer phone numbers\nresponding to questions from\nPartners the fifth example is healthcare\nservice Healthcare Systems contain\nnumerous burdensome task that involves\nsignificant resource allocation such as\nclaim management this results in high\noperational cost and slow process every\nindustry has inefficiencies but few face\nthe healthcare industry's challenges\nstrict regulations regarding patient\ndata and lack of resources to deal with\nsuch rules building takes time after a\nhealthcare service is provided due to\nmanual and repetitive task in the\nmanagement process management process\ninclude document and data input\nprocessing and valuation in addition to\nthe automating time consuming task\npatients can schedule appointments\nwithout the intervention of hospital\nemployees credit to RPA technology along\nwith eliminating the need of resource\nallocation for scheduling by allowing\npatients to reschedule appointments more\nquickly this application can improve\ncustomer relations RPA allows Healthcare\nProviders to track and document each\nprocess step in structured log files to\ncomply with external audits RPA improves\ndata confidentiality because BS handle\nthis\nprocess let's consider an example daily\na healthcare organization deals with the\nprocess of patient transaction Data\ncustomer detailed recording claims to\nthe process and data reconcilation for\nhealthcare schemes are some of the\nmanual process they must streamline\ndaily the primary goal was to increase\nthe efficiency of existing approaches to\nachieve greater accuracy with reduced\nturnaround time robotic process\nautomation was implemented and the most\nsign significant possible impact was\nobtained RPA platform handled claims\nprocessing and H data reconciliation\nprogram Healthcare was able to reduce\nturnaround time with this\nsolution the task performed by RPA BS in\nhealthcare service are appointment\nscheduling Regulatory Compliance data\nentry and supporting analytics to\nimprove treatment in this video we're\ngoing to compare the most commonly used\nRPA tools namely blue prism U by path\nand automation anywhere so what's in it\nfor you first we learn why exactly RPA\ninto picture and then what exactly RPA\nis lastly we'll compare the tools based\non trial version based Technologies\nprocess designer accessibility macro\nrecorders architecture learning robots\naccuracy reusability pricing and then\ncertification so without further Ado\nlet's begin and understand why was our\nRP\nintroduced consider the process of\nonboarding a recruit to your\norganization the whole process will\ninvolve tasks like creating a new user\naccount a new email address access\nrights documents retrieval and so on so\ninstead of doing all of this manually\none can automate the process so with RPA\nthe user can automatically activate a\ntemplate for the onboarding workflow RPA\ncan help assess prepare and create new\njoin e data initiate mailing of offer\nletters and streamline the information\nacross different\nsystems so what is RPA robotic process\nautomation is the use of software with\nartificial intelligence and machine\nlearning capabilities to handle high\nvolume repeated tasks that previously\nrequired humans to perform now some of\nthese tasks could include addressing\nqueries making calculations maintaining\nrecords or even making transactions\nnow RPA tools are the software through\nwhich one can configure tasks that are\nto be automated so some of the widely\nused tools are UI part Studio automation\nanywhere blue prism work Fusion among\nothers now assuming you have a basic\nunderstanding of RPA let's go on and\ncompare the popularly used\ntools first up is trial version every\ntool generally offers a trial version\nfor its users to get acquainted with the\ntool this helps the users understand the\ntool better and decide if they want to\nproceed with using the tool blue prism\noffers a free child version it's\navailable in two options either on the\ncloud or on the local computer uipath\nalso offers a free edition both trial\nand license versions are available\nautomation anywhere offers a free\ncommunity version and both Tri and\nlicensed versions are\navailable next up is base Technologies\nbased Technologies Define the technology\nwith which the software was built blue\nprism is based on C uipath is based on\nMicrosoft vendors like SharePoint kibana\nand elastic\nstarch while automation anywhere is\nbased on Modern Java\nTechnologies the Third third feature of\ncomparison is process designer blueprism\nenables you to create design edit as\nwell as test business processes from the\nvisual business object now a vbo is like\nan adapter provided by Blue prism for\ncommunicating with an application each\nvisual business object implements a\nspecific set of operations on an\napplication's user\ninterface so these are basically like\nobjects that encapsulate a particular\nfunctional logic\nUI paath on the other hand acts as a\nvisual process designer with developer\nfriendly options now a visual process\ndesigner is a dashboard consisting of\nvarious tools through which the\ndeveloper can Define the automation\ntasks automation anywhere is developer\nfriendly with the visual interface built\nfor business users along with Advanced\nfeatures for developers business users\nand developers can work side by side to\nbuild bot\nthey can see the visual interface and\ncode in a single\nscreen the next feature of comparison is\naccessibility blueprism offers browser\nbased access only UI path and automation\nanywhere on the contrary offer both\napplication based and browser based\naccessibility in case of automation\nanywhere the control room can be\naccessed with a browser or a mobile\napplication this is the only platform\nwhere use can create bots on any device\nor any operating\nsystem moving on to the next\nfeature learning now in case of Blue\nprism the user should have the necessary\nknowledge of programming he should be\nable to create business objects and\nmanage them in the control center UI\npath enables you to design automation\nprocesses visually through diagrams the\ndeveloper need not know a programming\nlanguage in particular when it comes to\nautomation anywhere it is developer\nfriendly and offers both Visual and\nprogramming features business users can\nbuild Bots with the help of drag and\ndrop features beginners benefit from the\nbuilt-in product walk\nthrough next up is robots now before we\njump in let's discuss what the different\ntypes of bots are there are two types of\nbots you have the front office Bots\nwhose deployment is in the user's\ncontrol\nwe also have back office Bots that can\nrun on locked machines from an\norchestrator the user may not be\nactively involved in it's\nworking so moving on to the\ncomparison blue prism offers back office\nautomation only UI path and automation\nanywhere offer both front and back\noffice Automation in case of automation\nanywhere the HBC or the human bot\ncollaboration feature enables humans and\nBots to work together to complete a task\nand also to manage exceptions and\nescalations moving on the next feature\nis macro recorder now the macro recorder\nallows you to record keyboard activities\nand mouse events to generate automation\nscripts these activities are arranged\nbased on the order or sequence of\nactions being performed on the screen so\nmoving on to the comparison blue prism\ndoes not use a macro\nrecorder uip paath makes use of a macro\nrecorder to enable fast process mapping\nautomation anywhere offers a universal\nrecorder so that the user need not\nselect different recorders for different\ntasks moving on to the next feature\narchitecture an application that runs on\nthe client site and accesses the remote\nserver for information uses the client\nserver architecture whereas an\napplication that runs entirely on a web\nbrowser uses the web architecture in\ncase of a client server architecture the\nuser interaction with the server is\nalways through a user interface or\napplication on the client side on the\nother hand in a web application the user\ninteraction is Thoroughly through a web\nbrowser now blueprism and uipath both\nincorporate a client server architecture\nautomation anywhere incorporates a cloud\nnative web based microservices\narchitecture it is the only platform\nthat provides a complete digital worker\nSolution on the web users with any skill\nlevel can instantly start building\nrobots on a browser without any heavy\ninstallation the next feature is\naccuracy blueprism is accurate for\ndesktop web and Citrix automation UI\npart shines and Citrix automation\ndesigned for BPU automation\nand automation anywhere shines in CX\nautomation with AI Sense\nTechnology well any automation solution\nbuilt using a virtual desktop or built\nto work in Virtual desktops is called\nCitrix\nautomation moving on to the next feature\nreusability blue prism consists of a\nlibrary of business objects that can be\nreused across multiple methods it also\noffers High reliability\nin the case of uip paath the processes\ncan be used for various synthesis\nservices with several workfl modules as\na result uipath offers a high degree of\nusability and moderate\nreliability in the case of automation\nanywhere apart from the standard common\nLibrary users can develop custom actions\nupload and manage packages in their\nEnterprise control room every bort\ncreated in automation anywhere is\nreusable the bot store has hundreds of\npre-configured bots and digital workers\nto Kickstart a user RPA\nJourney next up is pricing blue prism\nhas a high cost of acquisition it also\noffers restricted training uip paath\noffers effective Pleasant entry-level\npricing automation anywhere offers\nattractive entry-level\npricing its users also experience the\nlowest total cost of ownership ship\nbecause of its native capabilities and\nweb- based\narchitecture moving on to the last\nfeature\ncertifications blue prism offers several\ncertifications like blue prism\nprofessional developer blue prism ROM\narchitect among others uip part provides\nfree online training and certification\nprograms like RPA developer Advanced\ncertification automation anywhere\nuniversity offers free online training\nand certification programs for both\nstudents and advanced practitioners\nprofessionals can also Avail job Ro\nspecific\ncertifications there are several RPA\ntools in the market today however\nblueprism automation anywhere and uip\npaath are leading the market let's get\nstarted with what is uip\npaath uip paath is a robotic process\nautomation tool for large scale endtoend\nautomation for an accelerated business\nchange\nit provides solution for business to\nautomate routine office\nactivities it uses a variety of methods\nto transform tedious task into automated\nprocess Daniel D and Marius Tika\nRomanian entrepreneurs founded UI path\nin Bucharest in 2005 the first uip part\ndesktop automation product line was\nlaunched in 2013 giving business RPA\ntools to automate manual and repetitive\nback office task let's look at the\nfeatures of of uip\npaath drag and drop workflow the user of\nuipath will develop visual process steps\nby dragging and dropping related task\nonto the graphical workspace then with\nthe user interface properties they can\ntransform those process steps into a\nvisual\nworkflow users may also use the recorder\nwizard in the UI part tool to build web\nbased or application\nworkflows the next feature is record and\nPlayback the user can use this function\nto record actions and trans for them\ninto automated process\nseries UI path has the following types\nof recording\noptions basic recording it focuses on\nautomating single task and is commonly\nused to develop each activity's complete\nselector desktop recording it can be\nused for a variety of actions as well as\nactions\ndevelopment web recording it is a common\ntool for viewing and recording web page\nactivities Citrix recording it is very\nwidely used for recording stuff like and\nvirtualized environment\nautomation next we have inbuilt\nactivities in uipath uip paath comes\nwith over 300 built-in activities\ncovering a wide range of process\nAutomation and application integration\ndesign\ntask these activities are found in\nactivity Spain which covers most\ndesigned tasks such as data extraction\ndata entry and\nautomation next we have advaned scraping\noptions scraping data from web pages and\napplications is easier with UI path\nscreen scraping furthermore the data\nscreen scraping wizard helps in scraping\nof data with a repetitive structure\nscraping solution Works flawlessly with\nany program including net Java flash PDF\nLegacy and\nsap next we have high security and\nrobustness we can create super smart\ndurable robots with uip path with a\nsimple visual canvas everyone in the\ncompany can use Bots uip paath offers\nhigh security Auto login functionality\nto run the Bots and operates with a\nlocked screen allowing automated process\nto run in complete\nprivacy let's look at the components of\nuipath the first component we have\nuipath Studio uipath robot and uipath\norchestrator let's look at them one by\none this is how a uip studio looks like\nuip studio is a user fendly interface\ninside the tool that allows user to\nvisually plan and design various\nautomation process through diagrams\nusing drag and drop functionality these\ndiagrams are merely a structural\nreflection of specific task that must be\ncompleted this is the activity pane in\nthe UI part Studio it consists of\nproject activities and\nSnippets this is the ribbon tab it\nconsists of saving options opening new\nfiles debugging files recording screen\nscraping data scraping and many more we\nwill explore this in the demo\nsection next we have output put pan\nwhere output is being\ndisplayed and we have the properties pan\nwhere the properties of each activity is\nshown\nhere the next component is uipath robot\nafter you have built your process the\nnext move is to put into action in the\nuipath studio uipath robots are used to\ntranslate the process into task which\nare then executed these robots are used\nto assign various task and carry them\nout in the same manner as humans but\nwithout human interference when given\noperation occurs on the computer uipath\nrobots are programmed to begin executing\ntask\nautomatic next we have uipath\norchestrator the orchestrator is a web-\nbased application in uipath it has\nfeatures like deploying monitoring\nscheduling and controlling automated\nBots and process it's a centralized\nforum for managing and controlling all\nsoftware\nBots let's look at the architecture of\nuipath it consist of two sections the\nclient side and the server side and the\nthree layers let us look at them one by\none we will first look at the client\nside and the server side client side uip\npaath components are those that the user\nor developer can communicate with\ndirectly uipath Studio uipath robot\nbrowser and uipath agent are usually\nincluded uipath's backend operation are\nconsidered server side the task and\nworkflows that a user produces are saved\nin the databases\nuip paath orchestrator chooses the\nnecessary function and the software\nrobots to carry out the cod's task the\nrobots locks and statistics are stored\nin the back end locks are useful for\nanalyzing robot performance and\ndetecting errors in them the two\nelements comprise the uip path robot\nagent support for UI path and the execut\na service for uip path the agent support\nfor uip paath is the service in uip path\nthat serves as the mediator between the\nclient side and the server side of uip\npaath all of the information and data\nare conveyed via the Handler messages\nare also logged into the orchestrator\nbefore being moved to the SQL Server the\nservice can be used to search all of the\ncurrently available task in the device\ntray it also can change device settings\nand start and stop the current task\nexecute a service for uipath in this the\nsoftware robots use this service to\ncarry out the task specified in the\nwindows session now let us look at the\nthree layers first one is the the\npresentation layer this uip path\ncomponents that are open to the users\nmake up the client layer uipath Studio\nrobots browsers uipath agent and\nexecutors for example a user or a\ndeveloper may use these components to\ndesign and create different task that\ncan be automated computer robots are\ncommonly used to complete this task the\nclient layer is an another name for the\npresentation layer let us look at the\nservice layer the UI Parts architectures\nmost significant sheet the cloud layer\nshows all server information the uip\npaath orchestrator is the most\nsignificant part of the server layer\nwhen the robots can perform the task the\nentire project is periodically uploaded\nto the server within the aid of an\norchestrator the project is often\ncarried out through several structures\nthe orchestrator is in charge of the\nwhole band it keeps track of the project\ndevelopment schedule software robots for\nexecution and produces summary reports\nbased on the filtered par meter it\nassists in the synchronization of\nsoftware robots so that they can\ncontinue to perform routine task it\nhelps our project meet project\nrequirements service levels and\ndeadlines thanks to its web based\nmanagement\nsystem now let us look at the\npersistence layer database servers make\nup the bulk of this sheet during this\nlayer all of the robots configuration\ninformation is saved users insert data\nrobots assigned task logging information\nand sets among the other items into the\norchest stratus configuration details\nfurthermore persistency layer is in\ncharge of keeping the log information\nupdated by the uip paath agent Services\nelastic search is used to store this\nlocks the locks are primarily useful for\nlocating and correcting errors process\nlevel data is usually saved in\nrelational database management system\nsuch as SQL Server this makes processing\nlogs from the vast volume of data a lot\nsimpler hence the cues task are often\ntaken care by the persistency layer\nlet's look at some of the applications\nof uip\npaath in sales in sales UI path is used\nto generate invoice this is an example\nof data replication in action both CRM\nand accounting systems must have the\nsame sales details ports can update\naccounting records prepar and and\ninvoices from the appropriate email\naddresses instead of manually\nreplicating data it is also used in\nkeeping scorecards up to date companies\nthat do not have HR and CRM systems\nintegrated can use RPA bards to ensure\nthat CRM adjustments are submitted to\nscorecards in real time allowing sales\nreps to track their progress it is used\nin CRM updating a new class of solution\nis evolving to incorporate their email\ncall and other contact data into CRM a\nsimple bot could be return to update\nyour CRM records with customer contact\ninformation if you can't find a suitable\nsolution for using the CRM\nsystems next it is used in banking in\nbanking it is used to check\nkyc though dedicated kyc Solutions are\nevolving RPA Bots can be used to\nautomate portions of the kyc process if\nyour organization does not want to use\none a case may be referred to an\nemployee in the event of an edge case\nthat requires human involvement it is\nused in sanction of loans like most\ndocument process activities this method\nis appropriate to RP automation because\ncomplex business logic can be embedded\nin Bots which can partially automate\nloan decisions and the manual process\nthat follow it is used in execution of\ntrade RPA Bots may be useful in\nsituations where Legacy systems are\nincapable of storing complex limit\norders however this is more a Band-Aid\nsolution in the long run switching to a\nsophisticated and competent trading\nsystem will certainly be a smart\ninvestment consider ing how it could\nincrease trading and minimize Trader\nworkload next it is used in healthcare\nin healthcare it is used for appointment\nscheduling the RPA bot makes appointment\nfor patient based on their diagnosis\ndoctor availability location and other\nfactors such as financial statement and\ninsurance details it is used in\nsupporting analytics to improve patient\ntreatment RPA Bots May collect a variety\nof medical information RPA BS for\nexample can use patient data to a third\nparty Healthcare analytics provider to\nprovide more reliable diagnosis and\nbetter patient care without violating\nany confidentiality regulations let's\nlook at the benefits of uip\npath increase productivity UI path\nautomates with quick speed and\naccessibility consider an RPA B that\nallows a worker to produce a monthly\nreport in 20 minutes instead of manually\ntaking 4 hours the company's\nproductivity could increase as a result\nof process\nautomation next we have high efficiency\nRPS software does not need a break it\ncan operate 24 hours a day a single RPA\nrobot may replace two to five full-time\nworkers if not more robots can do the\nsame amount of work in less time or more\nwork at the same time than\nhumans customer experience in RPA\nadopted business routine and repetitive\nand boring task are assigned to robot\nallowing employees to focus more on\nCustomer Service Company may meet\nconsumer needs with the help of\nprofessional and knowledgeable\nemployes highly secure there is no risk\nof information leakage from one\ncomponent to another because it performs\nsingle task as a result data access is\nstrictly monitored and\nreported cost effective uip path has\nminimal operating cost and more\nefficient use of it\nresources let's look at the top comp is\nhiring uip part\ndevelopers infosis IBM Deo ey\nKPMG Tata Tech Mahindra and cap\nJ let's look at the salary trends for\nuip part\ndevelopers the average pay scale for a\nuip part developer in India is 545,000\nrupees uip part developer salary ranges\nfrom\n362,000 Rupees to 1 million\nin USA the uip developer salary ranges\nfrom\n$58,000 to\n$107,000 and the average salary is\n$76,000 let's look at a demo consider a\nscenario where you have multiple Excel\nfiles you want to combine the data in\nsingle file in this demo we will merge\ntwo Excel files into a single Excel file\nand send it over an email let's create\nautomation to two Excel files using uip\npath from here we can open a new project\nor existing project stored locally or on\nversion control system with the click we\ncan open a new project or create a new\nproject from a template uip paath offers\nmany templates depending on what you're\ntrying to do for now let us start with a\nblank\nproject so we'll open a blank project\nhere so we'll open our main\nworkflow then we'll go to new and select\na new sequence we can do it using a\nflowchart as well but for now I'll show\nyou doing a sequence so we'll open the\nsequence and we'll name the sequence\nsince we are merging two files I'll name\nit as merging\nfiles and I'll create\nit so we'll go to the activity\nspan firstly we need to drag and drop a\nread CSV activity so so search for read\nCSV so drag and drop read CSV activity\nsince we are using two Excel files so we\nneed to read CSV\nactivities and read from the file we\nneed to select the file\nlocation so we'll select the file\nlocation sample CSV file\n1 and at the file two we'll select\nanother file\nlocation sample CSV\nfile at the output side we'll create a\nvariable and name it as slore file\n1 similarly for another read\nCSV we'll create a variable and name it\nas a\n_ File\n2 so this much is done now we need an\nassign activity so we'll search for\nassign\nactivity so we'll drag and\ndrop assign activity has two parameters\ntwo and enter and\nexpression so in the two we'll create a\nvariable\nname name it as\nmerged and and in the\nexpression write an expression say SL\nslore file\n1 do\nclone why are we using a clone function\nthe Clone function creates a new data\ntable with same structure but does not\ncopy the data oops it's showing an error\nhere so what's the\nerror so we need to assign the variable\ntype to\nbe system. dat. data\ntable here we go error has\ngone so after using the assigned\nactivity we need to merge the data table\nso we need merge data table activity so\nsearch for merge\ndata table here we go drag and drop\nit we need to much data table\nactivities so drag and\ndrop and specify the destination and\nSource\nhere destination is the\nmergel and the source is the lore file 1\nfor the First Data M\ntable similarly for second merge data\ntable destination remains\nsame Source will change to slore file\n2 so this is done so next we need to\ndrag and drop a right CSV\nfile right CSV file creates an output\nfile in which you want to merge the two\nfiles so search\nfor right\nCSV here we go drag and drop\nit so choose the path create the file so\nyou can see there is no output file here\nso we'll create the output file now\nwhich is an empty f file so output.\nCSV so we have created an output\nfile so right from we'll write it as\nmerged we need the data from\n[Music]\nmerged so the output file is created so\nnow we need to send the file over and\nmail so for that we need to drag and\ndrop a get password activity\nso we'll search for get password\nactivity here we go drag and drop\nit\nand once you get this get password\nactivity enter the password Here enter\nyour password email ID\npassword so there is a prerequisite when\nyou use get\npassword to receive the mail go to your\nGoogle account in Google account go to\nyour security option and in security\nthere is an option called less secure\napp access turn that on I'll repeat turn\non the less secure app access okay once\nthe get password is\ndone go to the result section in the\nresult section right click and create a\nvariable name it something maybe\nSSS so I created a variable there so we\nneed an last activity now that is smt\nmail\nmessage\nSMTP mail\nmessage I and drop\nit so in the host port and enter This\nServer so the server you have to enter\nit as\nSMTP do Gmail all should be in the\ndouble\ncodes\nsmtp.gmail.com\nand enter the port number\nas\n587 and enter your email ID\nhere which\nis your own email ID I'll enter\nmy once you enter the email ID enter the\npassword\nwhat we had\ncreated so that's done so enter the\nemail ID\nhere enter the subject whatever you\nwant so I'll enter it as merged\ndata merged Excel\nfiles enter the body\nso we'll attach the\nfile so what is the file which we are\nattaching\nhere so we are attaching the output file\nwhat we have named it as output. CSV\nfile so that's it we'll run the program\nwe'll run the\ncode sample execution has started\nand within the 10 seconds sample\nexecution has ended so we'll go and\ncheck if we have received the mail so\nthis is my email\nID here we go we have received the email\nhere let's open this let's open the\noutput\nfile here we go you can see the data is\nbeing\nmerged and if you go to the file where\nthe documents were stored here you go\nthis were the two files the sample file\n1 and Sample File 2 and this is the mer\nfile which was created let me show you\nthe sample file\n1 and Sample File\n2 so this is the sample file one with 10\nrows and this is sample File 2 which\nalso has 10\nrows so this is file two with 10 rows\nand file one with 10\nrows and here we go this this is the\noutput file which has both 10 10 rows\nmerged here here we go it is sent over\nand made in this video we will be\nlooking at the installation of uip so\nlet us see the\nrequirements we will first look at the\nhardware requirements the CPU should at\nleast have a processor of 1.4 GHz 32-bit\nconfiguration or it's recommended to\nhave a 1.8 GHz 64-bit\nconfiguration the device is recommended\nto have a ram of 8 GB if not at least a\nminimum of 4 GB let us look at the\nsoftware requirements if you're using a\nWindows operating system then Windows\nshould be of version 8.1 or 8.1 n or 10\nor 10n and the Windows Server should be\nof 2012 R2 2016 or 2019 versions another\nprequest site is to have NET Framework\nof minimum of\n4.5.2 version\ninstalled let us look at the additions\nthe different additions that uipath\noffers uipath offers two types of\neditions Community Edition and\nEnterprise Edition Community Edition is\nfor the developers and small teams who\nare just starting on their automation\nJourney the Enterprise Edition is\nfurther classified into three types\nEnterprise Studio Edition Enterprise\nCloud Edition and Enterprise server\nEdition so Enterprise Studio Edition is\nfor individual Enterprise developers who\nwant to experiment with uip part Studio\nprise cloud is a cloud-based deployment\nof entire RPA Enterprise platform for\nany size business Enterprise server on\npremises deployment for entire\nEnterprise automation platform for large\nscale\nbusiness let us look at the different\nprofiles in uip uip part Studio X uip\npart studio and uod Studio Pro uod\nStudio X is for business users if you're\nnot a developer but if you want to\nautomate a simple task then it is easy\nto use a studio X uip path Studio it is\nfor RPA developers build complex\nautomation that is run by attended or\nattended Robots uip part Studio Pro it\nis for the specialized developers\nautomate with the AI Advanced RPA\nfeatures testing tools and sophisticated\ncoding services so we will look at the\ninstallation let us install\nuipath go to any one of the browser and\nsearch for uip part.com\nthis will take you to the official uip\npaath\nwebsite here you can see try uip paath\nfor\nfree click\nhere since I have already registered\nbefore it is showing as continue to\nexisting organization if you're visiting\nthis website for the first time then you\nmight have to register or sign in using\nan email account after signing in and\nfilling all the details you can\ncontinue here you can see download uip\npart\nStudio click on this and download the\nuip part Studio here you go the uip part\nStudio setup file is getting download\ndownloaded once the UI path file is\ndownloaded run the setup file and here\nyou can see the UI path is getting\ninstalled after installation it will ask\nfor a license Select Community license\nwhich is\nfree after selecting the license you\nneed to choose a profile there are three\nprofiles uip part Studio Pro which is\nthe Advan Studio IDE it has features\nlike testing tools Advanced RPA feat\nfeatures and coding\nServices another profile is uip part\nStudio it is for developers who have\npreer programming\nexperience and the last profile is the\nuipath studio X it is for the people who\ndon't have any programming experience so\nwe will select uipath Studio X for now\nnext uipath will ask you to update the\nchannel you can either select this table\nversion or preview version we will\nselect thisable version for now after\nyou select the versions you need to\nselect the source control plugins you\ncan enable G version control system or\nApache sub version and Azure devop\nserver uip paath provides a short\nintroduction video tutorials to learn\nhow to build automations following\nstep-by-step instructions and an academy\nto take free training on the uip paath\nacademy so that's it you have success\nfully installed UI part Studio from here\nyou can open a new project new template\nand start building the first Automation\nin this video we will learn about uip\npart studio in depth and understand it's\nworking with a demo so what is uip\npaath now RPA is a technology with which\nhuman tasks can be automated to\nfacilitate this a tool is required uip\npaath is one such tool among others that\nare used to create Bots with the help of\nvisual processes and\ndiagrams it provides complete end to-end\nautomation calling it hyper automation\nUI path was founded by Daniel dines and\nMario stka in\n2005 uip paath is specially used for\nWindows process automation it automates\nrepetitive tasks and lastly uipath\noffers drag and draw functionalities to\nmake it easy to\nuse now since there are so many other\ntools like blue prism automation\nanywhere in the market\nwhat makes uipath stand out so let's\nlook at the advantages of\nuipath first uipath has an activity\nLibrary this library has several\nbuilt-in activities and features like\ndisplay message input box and so on this\nimproves the customer experience we will\ndeal with these activities in the demol\nlater next up is security RPA deals with\na variety of information like credit\ncard number numbers financial\ninformation and passwords uipath offers\nextensive security since all the\ninformation can be encrypted and stored\non a centralized\nserver up next we have\nrecorders so uipath uses a micro\nrecorder to record the user actions such\nas Mouse clicks and keystrokes once the\nactions are recorded they can be\nemulated using emulators for quick\nautomation third party\nintegration uip paath can be integrated\nwith third party plugins like IBM Watson\nand Google\nplugins then we have powerful\ndebugging uip part Studio comes with a\ndebug component that helps find and\nlocate problems easily in complex\nworkflows this is useful for viewing the\nexecution of each activity to verify\nwhat data it gets and if there are\nerrors in producing\noutputs now let's understand the various\nuip paath\nproducts first up is UI\nStudio this is the platform to create\nthe Bots this product consists of all\nthe necessary drag and drop activities\nand a robost UI to help develop bots of\nyour choice now the UI part Studio\nconsists of the GUI dashboard it offers\na visual dashboard with activities like\nsend email display message and so\non then we have types of recorders uip\nStudio offers various types of recorders\nto record actions on multiple\nplatforms then then we have logging and\nexception handling it offers various\noptions for debugging and exception\nhandling such as debug open logs slow\nstep Etc and finally we have reusable\ncomponents the user can create reusable\ncomponents to publish them together as\nlibraries next we have the uipath robots\nall the automation task that created are\nrun by uipath robots there are two types\nof robots\nattended robots and unattended robots\nattended robots work with you to speed\nup service desk and help desk it is used\nin activities where human involvement is\nthe key unattended robots operate\nwithout human touch maximizing cost and\nperformance benefits for any variety of\nback office\ntasks lastly we have the uipath\norchestrator the orchestrator is like a\ncentralized entity where you can deploy\nsecure manage all your automation tasks\nhere are the steps involved first you\ncreate a bot now you create a project\nand publish it as a process for further\nuse once a process is created it is\nassigned to a specific robot to execute\nin an environment this collectively\nconstitutes a\njob now let's move on to the\narchitecture of uiip paath so on the top\nyou have the client layer consist in of\nuipath studio and the uipath\nrobot now the uipath robot has two parts\none is the uipath agent service which\ndisplays all the available jobs in the\nsystem tree and the other one is the\nuipath executor service which is used to\nrun the jobs in one Windows\nsession the server layer receives the\nrobot once it is ready for execution\nwith the help of the orchestrator you\ncan run the project on different\nPCS the orchestrator monitors the\ndeploys configures Q management and\nlogging lastly we have the persistent\nlayer which consists of the databases it\ntakes care of the cues and holds\ninformation about the robot\nconfiguration and their assigned\nprocesses now that we know what UI path\nis let's acquaint ourselves with its\nuser interface and understand its\ncomponents better so this is what the\ntypical interface looks like first we\nhave the ribbon it consists of three\ntabs whole home design and\ndebug home is where you start a new\nproject from predefined templates or\nopen a project you recently worked on by\ndefault the projects are created in the\nlocation shown\nbelow next is the design\ntab design tab adds sequences flowcharts\nand state machines to your project it\ninstalls and manages activity packages\nit builds interactions with UI elements\nand then publishes your work to\norchestrator finally is\ndebug it debugs your workflow while\nusing debugging tools to set up break\npoints monitor the execution of activity\nstep-by step and adjust the debugging\nspeed next on the screen is\ntools so the tools tab can be used for\ninstalling extensions from chrome\nFirefox Edge Java silver light Citrix\nand windows remote desktop and is also\nused for launching the UI Explorer and\nproject dependencies Mass update\ntool then we we have\nsettings the settings tab has options\nfor changing the interface language\ntheme setting Global preferences and\nmanaging activity\nfeeds so you have general settings then\nthere is settings for design locations\nmanage resources and finally license and\nprofile up next you have Help The Help\ntab directs you to product documentation\nrelease notes online resources the\ncommunity forum and the RPA\nAcademy after that you have the recorder\nthe recorder component in uipath studio\nallows the user to record UI Mouse\nmovements and keyboard activities to\ngenerate automation\nscripts after that you have scraping so\nuip part Studio supports two types of\nscraping one is screen scraping and the\nnext one is data scraping so screen\nscraping is programmatic collection of\nvisual data and data scraping is the\nextra action of structured data from an\napplication then you have user\nevents user events records events such\nas Mouse clicks and\nkeystrokes then you have variables so\nvariables hold different types of data\nthese variables can change over time\nuipath makes an easy provision to create\nand remove unused\nvariables on the bottom left you have\nproject so the project panel enables you\nto view the components of the current\nproject add folder open the file\nlocation manage dependencies and adjust\nproject settings beside it you have\nactivities panel so the activities panel\nshows available activities that can be\nadded to the current workflow users can\nuse the search box to find activities\nnavigate through them using navigation\nkeys and\npress you also have the Snippets panel\nwhich enables you to easily reuse\nautomation it includes by default\nmultiple samples and Snippets\nto the bottom right you have the\nproperties panel which is contextual and\nenables you to view and change the\nproperties of a selected\nactivity you also have the outline panel\nwhich displays the project hierarchy all\navailable variables and nodes you can\nhighlight activities in this panel by\nselecting them in the designer panel the\noutput panel enables you to display the\noutput of the log message or right line\nactivities among other things exceptions\nfor packages are also displayed in this\npanel\npanel so now that you have understood\nthe interface of uipath let's look at\nthe companies using\nuipath so you have Accenture cap jini\ncognizant atos and delo to name a\nfew now we'll do a demo to automate a\ntask using uod\nStudio so here is what we are going to\ndo in the demo we'll create an automated\nprocess to fetch data from a website\nwherein the bot would extract data like\nthe name of the person the phone number\nand the email ID this data will store it\nin an Excel seat and send it over an\nemail now let's get\nstarted now to do this demo we'll be\nusing the fake name generator website to\nGenerate random data of people and store\nthis data set in an Excel sheet now if I\nhad to do this manually I would first\ncreate an Excel sheet so let me open an\nExcel workbook\nI'll create a blank\nworkbook so this is where I'll put my\ndata if I had to do it\nmanually so now let me take you to the\nfake name generator website so I'll\nsearch for fakename generator.com\nso this is the website where you can\ngenerate fake\nnames now if I had to store this data in\nExcel I would manually copy paste each\nand every detail and paste it onto the\nExcel\nsheet so for that first I had to create\ncolumns like\nname\nthen phone\nnumber and this in then\nemail after that I had to come back to\nthis and\ncopy each of these\nfields the\nname if I had to take the phone\nnumber so I would copy\nthis and similarly for the email address\nas\nwell for one record it is fine what if\nif are asked to fetch 100 records or say\n200 records then this method is not at\nall\nfeasible it is timec consuming and\ninefficient you need to find a way where\nyou can automate this task of fetching\nrecords uip path is a solution for this\nso let's see how we can automate this\ntask using the uipath\nstudio so I'll click on open main\nworkflow first we need to direct UI path\nto go to the fake name generator website\nfor that we need the sequence activity\nso let me search for sequence here so\nunder\nactivities I'll search for\nsequence\nand I'll drag it\nhere after that I need to open the\nwebsite in a web browser so for that let\nme search for another activity called\nopen browser so under\nactivity I look for open\nbrowser so I'll drag it on the sequence\nitself now it is asking you to insert\nthe URL of the\nwebsite and it must be within double\ncodes so I'll go to my\nwebsite copy paste the\nURL I have to give this UR URL within\ndouble codes then I'll paste\nit now we need to select the name of the\nbrowser where you want to open this\nwebsite so under input and browser type\nI'll choose\nChrome now let me go ahead and run this\nfile\nso under debug I have run\nfile I'll click on it\nso as you can see the website is\nautomatically opened in a new window on\nChrome I'll close\nthis the next step in the process is to\ntell the program how many records we\nwant to fetch from the website for this\nwe will create an input dialog box so\nunder activities\nI'll search for\ninput so here you get the input dialog\nbox I'll drag and drop it on the\ntop now it is asking us to give the\ndetails so I'll put it within double\ncodes say enter\nthe details of customers or say people\nand then\nhere I'll give enter the number of\nRecords you want to\nfetch\nnow now I have to store this information\nin a\nvariable so under\nvariables I'll create a variable and\nname it as\ntotal is the total number of Records I\nwant to\nfetch similarly under output result I'll\ngive the same variable name as\ntotal now we need to fet the details a\nnumber of times repeatedly say for 10\ntimes or 20 times or 50 times to do this\noperation I'll be using a dowi\nloop so to use a do while\nloop I'll first search for do\nwhile and I'll drop it to the do section\nof the\nsequence as you can see do while has two\ncomponents one is the body and the other\none is\ncondition the body has the things that\nyou want the program to do\nthe condition is where you evaluate\ncertain conditions every time when the\nprogram has to do a\ntask so for every step or iteration it\nwill check if the condition is true or\nnot and go inside the body of the\nloop now for doing this we need to\nassign a\nvariable\nso let's name the variable\nas Val\nand I'll change the variable type to\ninteger and I'll make the scope to\nsequence I'll also assign a default\nvalue of\nzero now we'll compare this Val to the\nvariable\ntotal so the condition I'll give is\ncheck if Val is less than total\nso under\ncondition I'll give Val less\nthan\ntotal so every time the value of Val is\nless than the total it will keep\nfetching the records from the\nwebsite you can see it has thrown some\nerror now this is\nbecause our total variable is of type\nstring while the Val variable is of type\ninteger\nso you can't compare an\ninteger with a string\nvariable so that would be absurd we need\nto convert the total variable to an\ninteger using the cint\nfunction so here itself I'll write C int\nwhich is convert this total variable to\ninteger you can see the error is\ngone the next thing I want to do is if\nthe value of the Val variable is is less\nthan total I'll increment the value of\nVal to\none so to do that I'll use an activity\ncalled\nassign so I'll check for\nassign and I'll drag it onto the\nbody so here I'll give\nVal equals to Val + 1\nthis will make sure the value of Val\nincreases by one every time there is a\nnew record inserted it will continue\nuntil the value of Val no longer matches\nthe\ntotal so the next job is to extract\ninformation from the website to do this\nwe will use the get full text\nactivity so I'll search for get full\ntext\nhere and I'll\ndrag it right below the assign\nactivity now you need to select the\ninformation which you want so first I\nwant to get the name I'll click on the\nindicate element inside browser and then\nselect the name of the\nperson so I'll click on\nthis\nand I'll click on the\nname there you go now we need to store\nthis name in a variable so I'll create a\nvariable so under variable I'll create a\nvariable called\nname and in the output\nalso I'll give the same variable\nname next I want to F the phone number\nof the\nPOR so I'll again select get full text\nand I'll drag\nit\nhere I'll click on indicate element\ninside\nbrowser so I'll scroll\ndown and I'll select the phone number of\nthe\nperson so we have selected the phone\nnumber similarly I'll store this phone\nnumber in a variable\nso I'll create a variable\ncalled phore\nnumber\nand the output text box also will give\nthe same variable as phone uncore\nnumber after that I want to get the\nemail address of the\nperson so I'll continue with the same\ndrill\nI'll select the activity once again\nwhich is get full text and I'll drag it\nright\nhere I'll click on indicate element\ninside\nbrowser and\nnow we'll select the email address which\nis this\none\nsimilarly I'll store the email address\nin a variable called email\nID and and in the output also we'll give\nthe same variable name which is email\nID now we need to store the names phone\nnumbers and email IDs into an Excel seat\nfor that we need to create a data\ntable so I'll search for data table\nunder\nactivities let me go ahead and do\nthat so I'll\nchoose build data table and drag it\nright below the input dialogue\nbox now this table has to be assigned to\na variable so let me do\nthat let me give a variable name\nas\nfetch underscore data _\ntable\nsimilarly in the output also will give\nthe same variable name which is fetch\ndataor\ntable one thing I need to tell you here\nis we'll change the variable\ntype so I'll select browse for\ntypes and look for data\ntable which\nis system.\ndat I'll drill\ndown and search for data table which is\nthis\none click\nokay we need to assign the column names\nto this data table so let me now do\nthat I'll\nuncheck all this and select the columns\nso we will give the First Column name as\nname\nitself click on okay select one more\ncolumn give it\nas phone\nnumber click okay and then we need the\nemail address\nI'll hit\nokay so we are\ndone so first the data table is created\nand then we'll write this data to an\nExcel\nfile after that we need to create rows\nfor the data\ntable for that I will search for\nrow under activities I'll search search\nfor\nrow\nand I'll\nselect add\nrow I'll select add data\nrow I'll place it right below where we\nhave created all the\nvariables now I want to add a\nfor the name phone number and email\naddress so under input I'll select array\nrow I'll expand this and within curly\nbraces I'll give my variable\nnames so those would be\nname give a comma and then phone\nunderscore number\ncomma\nemail _\nID click\nokay I made a mistake it should be\nwithin curly\nbraces okay\nnow to tell the table to which it should\nwrite the row two we need to assign\nunder the data table\nname so under data table I'll give fetch\nuncore dataor\ntable for every iteration a record will\nbe added to the table then we need to\nrefresh the page to extract the next set\nof information so for\nthat I will add another activity called\nclick\nand drop it right below the add data\nrow so under activities I'll search for\nclick and I'll\nselect Mouse click and I'll drop it\nright below this\none now we need to indicate where do we\nwant to click from the\nbrowser so click on\nthis go on top\nand select generate so we want to click\non\ngenerate next I will write the data to a\nCSV\nfile so I'll search for write CSV under\nactivities\nand I'll drop it towards the end of the\nsequence right\nhere now you need to give the location\nwhere you want to place this file on\nyour system and give the source from\nwhere it will take the\ninformation so let's give the location\nwhere you want to place this file I'll\nplace it on my desktop\nitself I'll name this as\nfetch save\nit and\nfor the\nsource I'll give fetch uncore dataor\ntable we are all set now let's run\nit so under debug file I'll select run\nfile\nI'll enter the number of Records so let\nme fetch 10 records click on\nokay now this might take some time\nI believe it has run successfully now\nlet me check for my CSV file that should\nideally be on my\ndesktop there you go so we have the CSV\nfile let me open it\nyou can see it has\nextracted 10 rows of\ndata and three columns namely name of\nthe person the phone number and the\nemail\naddress so we are done with the first\ntask of automatically generating data\nfrom a website the next task is to send\nthis file over email now to send an\nemail you need the SMTP activity\nso\nunder activities I'll search for\nSMTP I'll drag it right below\nhere now we need to configure\nthis I'll be actually sending this email\nfrom someone else's email ID to my email\nID so under two I'll give my email\naddress which\nis within codes I'll type abijit do\nbiswal\nat simply\nlearn.net\nI'll give a\nsubject\nas\nautomatic data\nextraction under body I'll give\nsomething like hi please find\nattached now we have to attach the\nfile we have to give the location of the\nfile here\nso let me go to\nproperties\nand I'll select this\ncancel past this\nhere followed\nby the file name which is\nfetch.\nCSV I'll click on\nokay after\nthat I have to give the host port number\nwhich is\n465\nand the\nand the server\nname which is\nsmtp.gmail.com\nunder log on I'll give the senders email\nID and have to give the password as\nwell under the receiver it's my email ID\nwhich is A.B simply learn.net for the\nsender I'll give the email ID as chinmai\ndo theps simply learn.net\nand I'll give a dummy name chinai\nso we are almost done let me now go to\ndebug file and run\nthis it is asking to enter the number of\nRecords I'll give five click on\nokay this will take some time so let's\njust wait\nso we have successfully run our\nprogram now let me check my inbox if I\nhave got any mail from\nchinmai so there you go I've got this\nemail and Below you can see\nthe fetch.

external\ndirector\nmachines you can use the machine page to\nprovision and manage system entities\nwhich you can then use to bind uipath\nrobots to the orchestrator it list all\nof the machines that are currently in\nuse as well as the types machines are\nGlobal tools which means they can be\naccess from any folder let's look at the\ndemo in this demo we will see how to\nconnect uip paath robot with the\norchestrator how to run workflow using\nthe\norchestrator let's go to the browser\nin the browser enter\nplatform. part.com\nthis will take you to the uip part.com\nwebsite you have already an account sign\nin enter the\npassword click on\nsign meanwhile open the uip paath\nassistant so this is the uip paath\nassistant so uipath robot is a kind of\nRepresentative which runs the workflow\nso we create a workflow in the uip\nstudio then we upload it on the cloud\norchestrator then we configure different\nrobots to run this workflow now that we\nhave logged in to the\norchestrator go to the\nadmin so you need to click here to add\ntenant for the uipath community free\nedition you can add only one tenant so I\nhave already created an tenant so this\noption is disabled for\nso when you click on the add tenant for\nthe first time the tenant window will be\ndisplayed then fill the tenant name\npassword and confirm the password and it\nwill ask you for name surname and email\naddress which is optional so after\nfilling the details click on provision\nthe tenant and the Tenant admin are\ncreated and displayed in the tenants\npage so as you can see the tenant is\ncreated there is an option here users\nand groups you can go to the users and\nyou can see the different users so so\nthis is my user this is me you can go to\nthe groups and see the different groups\nallocated and their\nlicenses so now that we have created a\ntenant I have named the tenant as admin\nlet's open\nit meanwhile you can open uip paath\nAssistant open uipath Assistant this is\nthe uip path robot there are two\ndifferent ways to connect a robot to the\norchestrator when is signing in the uip\npaath assistant it will get the token\nfrom the uip paath orchestrator by user\nauthentication and it will directly\nconnect machine and the robot and the\nother way is to manually connect so\nwe'll sign\nin enter the password\nnow you can see here robot is connected\nto the\norchestrator so when you sign in the\nrobot will get connected to the\norchestrator you can go here the\npreferences go to the orchestrator\nsettings and you can see here connected\nand\nlicense so let's go to the\norchestrator in the orchestrator go to\nthe tenant\ncontext and here you can see the robot\nis connected it's\nenabled if you go to the machines you\ncan see the machine is also\nconnected so you can see\nhere there is an unattended robot here\nso to get this unattended robot what you\nhave to do is go to the\nusers select the user which are using\nthis is my\nusername go to\nedit and here you should enable this\nunattended robot enable this option and\nenter the username to get the username\nyou can open the command prompt and\nenter who am I so you'll get the\nusername copy paste the username enter\nthe password and click on update and the\nunattended robot will get\ncreated so that is how you create the\nunattended\nrobot now that we have connected robot\nto the orchestrator let's open the uip\nstudio we'll create a workflow and then\nwe'll run it using the\nrobot so now we have opened the UI part\nStudio let's open a blank\nprocess after opening the uip PO Studio\nclick on open main work\nflow first we'll drag and drop a\nsequence then we need a input dialog box\nwe drag and drop input dialog\nbox enter a title let's say We'll enter\nit as uip path\norchestrator enter the input\nlabel we will enter it as enter your\nname\nlet the input type be as text box let's\ncreate a\nvariable say We'll name it as\nname and let the variable type be string\nand the scope is in the C\nscope we have created the variable so\nthe value entered should be the variable\nname now we'll drag and drop uh message\nbox theage should be displayed\nso enter a caption for the message say\nbit\nwelcome and enter the\ntext let's say\nhi and we need to concatenate it with\nthe variable\nname we say thanks for\nwatching this\nvideo so here we go we have created a\nworkflow now we need to publish this in\nthe orchestrator so you can see an\noption here called publish click on the\npublish button so you can see the\npackage name the version the new version\nand all the other things click on the\npublish\nbutton so the workflow is successfully\npublished\nso the name is blank process 3 and\nversion is\n1.0.6 so let's go to the\norchestrator in\norchestrator go to the my\nworkflow folder context in this go to my\npackages if you go here you can see\nrefresh\nhere so here you can see blank process\nthree the process what we did now it was\npublished 3 minutes ago\nlet's go to the process and the version\nwhat we published was\n1.0.16 so the name was blank process 3\nlet's start the\njob you can change the job priority\nwe'll keep it as normal the other things\nis default the process name and the job\ntype let's let execute this process one\ntime click on\nstart as you can see command send for\nblank processor three so here you can\nsee it is getting\nrun here you can see it is asking for\nuip PA orchestrator what we entered the\ntitle and enter your name let's enter\nsome name say\nsam we'll click okay so Hi Sam thanks\nfor watching this video there you go the\nmessage is been displayed like normally\nin UI P Studio we click on the Run\nbutton and run the workflow but here we\nhave published it in the orchestrator\nand through the orchestrator through the\nrobot we are running it and the message\nis display what is framework and its\npurpose the framework is intended to\nserve as a blueprint for users to create\nprocess that provide at a bare minimum a\nway to store interpret and easily change\nproject configuration data as well as\nrobot exception handling scheme and\nevent logging for all exceptions and\nrelated transaction\ninformation the system logs messages at\neach relevant stage in the process of\nresolving a business transaction and\nsends those logs to the orchestrator\nserver this in turn can be linked to the\nelk stack which is elastic search log\nstack and kibana platform which allows\nfor data storage and a variety of\ndifferent ways to represent the\ndata the purpose of our framework is to\nresolve a set of business\ntransaction a transaction is a small\namount of data and the steps needed to\nprocess it to complete a segment of\nbusiness process a process that reads a\nsingle email from a mailbox and extracts\ndata from it is a good\nexample what is a business\nprocess the sum of actions by which the\ndata required for a series of\ntransactions is collected processed and\ninput into or out of an it resource is\nreferred to as a business process we can\nclassify business process into three\ngroups based on the steps involved and\nhow they are repeated linear the steps\nof linear process are only done once and\nif different data needs to be processed\nthe automation must be run again\niterative the steps of iterative process\nare repeated several times but different\ndata items are used every time\ntransactional transactional systems like\niterative process have steps that\nreplicate several times over various\ndata\nobjects what is re\nframework the robotic Enterprise\nframework is a state machine based\nproject template the template includes\nseveral ready to use State containers\nfor launching applications retrieving\ndata processing it and closing the\ntransaction these states are linked\ntogether by a series of transactions\nthat cover all almost every requirement\nin a typical automation scenario several\nworkflows have been triggered Each of\nwhich deals with a different aspect of\nproject it's designed to incorporate all\nof the industry's best practices for\nlogging exception management application\ninitialization and other areas show\nshowing it to handle even the most\ncomplex business\nsituations let's look at the features of\nre framework the three features are\nsetting logging and business application\nexception\nsettings during the initialization phase\nof several process some configuration\nsettings and configuration values are\nfrequently read like URLs to the web\napplication orchestrator q names and\ndefault logging messages the framework\nmaintains the track of this information\nby reading it from a configuration file\nand storing it in a different dictionary\nobject shared by all states in instead\nof updating workflows directly this\nprovides a simple way to manage projects\nby adjusting values in the configuration\nfile\nlogging the built-in logging mechanism\nis another helpful feature of re\nframework the majority of system workf\nflows use log message activities to\nOutput information about what is\nhappening at each stage of\nexecution this can be used to not only\nidentify problems and Aid in the\ndebugging process but also to to\ngenerate visualization and reports about\nthe process execution like how many\ninvoices are handled every day how many\nfailures occur and what are the critical\ncauses of this failure business and\napplication\nexecution there may be conditions that\noccur during the execution of most\nprocess that are not part of the usual\nexecution flow and must be resolved to\nachieve more efficient\nautomation if the issue can be resolved\nby restarting application the framework\nwill do so automatically and attempt to\nprocess the transaction again such\nexceptions are known as application\nexception if the issue is with the data\nor an underlying business requirement\nthe system skips the transaction and\nmoves to the next such exception are\nknown as business\nexception let's look at the AR framework\narchitecture the r framework is\nimplemented as a state machine which is\na form of workflow which two\nadvantageous characteristics States and\ntransitions actions to be taken in\nresponse to the stated input are\ndescribed by States transitions that\nswitch the execution from one state to\nanother based on the results of the\nstate there are four key States in re\nframework that is initial State get\ntransaction data process transaction and\nend\nprocess initial State initialization\nthis is the point at which the procedure\nbegins\nit's an event where the process\ninitializes the settings and runs\napplication test to ensure that all of\nthe prerequisites for the process start\nor met so initialization transitions so\nthere are two transition system\nexception and successful when system\nexception when a system error is not\nnothing it gets transitioned to the end\nprocess if we have an application\nexception during the initialization\nphase we don't have enough details to\nstart the process as a result we we are\ngoing to the end process state to wrap\nit up successful when a system error is\nnothing it gets transition to get\ntransaction data if during the\ninitialization we have no error then we\ngo to the get transaction\ndata the next state is the get\ntransaction State this state retrieves\nthe next transaction object this can be\na q item or a collection item\ntransaction items are Q items by default\nbut this can be modified to meet your\nneeds this is also the state where the\ndeveloper can set the condition to exit\nthe state when there are no items to\nprocess get transaction data transitions\nthere are two transitions no data and\nnew\ntransaction no data if the transaction\nitem is nothing then we are at the end\nof our data collection so we go to the\nend process new transaction data if the\ntransaction item contains data then we\nprocess it next state is the process\ntransaction State the process\ntransaction said for the transaction\nitem obtained in the previous step it\nperforms actions and applies logic in\nvarious application if a transaction\nitem has been processed the process\nmoves on to the next transaction item\nthat is\navailable so there are three process\ntransaction transitions success business\nexception and system exception in\nsuccess if the condition is business\nrule exception is nothing and System\nerror is nothing then the transition to\nget transaction data if there is is a\nbusiness role exception it is logged and\nwe move on to the next\ntransition business exception if the\nbusiness role exception is not nothing\nthen it gets transitioned to get\ntransaction data if you have a business\nrule exception we log it and move to the\nnext transaction by going to the get\ntransaction data State system exception\nif you have an application exception we\nclose all programs kill them if they\nfail to complete take a screenshot at\nthe moment the exception happen and go\nto in it where we reinitialize our\nworking environment and begin a new form\nof transaction that has failed and\nfinally we have the end process State\nthe procedure is completed and the\napplication open during the automation\nare closed in the end process State\nsince this is the last state the final\nState there are no transition available\nin the end process\nState we'll explore each one of the\nstates in detail in the demo let's see\nthe demo\nnow in this demo we will see how to\ndispatch data from the Excel file then\nwe will create Q items and process these\nitems and then we will understand the\nworking of each state in the robotic\nEnterprise framework in\ndetail so let's get started first we'll\ngo to the orchestrator and create a\nqueue ENT Cloud\nplatform.\nUI sign up\nthen go to the\norchestrator the ten end which you have\ncreated select the folder context go go\nto the folder context and you can see\ncues here go to the cues and you can see\na option to add here click on ADD and\nenter a q\n[Music]\nname I enter it as RF enter any\ndescription if you want give unique\nreference yes and\nadd and you can see a queue is been\nadded so you can add an asset as well to\nadd an asset you can go to add click\nhere add and enter the asset\n[Music]\nname and select the\ntype whatever is required say\nBoolean by default be it as false we\ncreate so this is how you create an\nasset so let's go to the UI part studio\nso what we are basically doing is we are\nbuilding two process one to feed a queue\nin the orchestrator that is a dispatcher\nprocess and one to process transaction\nfrom the que that is using the robotic\nEnterprise framework so in dispatcher\nprocess what we do is we get entries\nfrom an Excel file and add them as a\nqueue items in the orchestrator we have\nalready created a queue we started\nproject as a sequence and added a TR\ncatch we started with the sequence added\na tri catch activity in the tri\nblock we used a read range activity to\nread first 10 lines from A1 to C11 from\nan Excel file and store them in a newly\ncreated data table\nvariable we used for each row to Loop\nthrough the rows of the data table\nvariable and add each of them in a queue\nusing the add Q item activity then we\nuse the log\nmessage we use log message activity to\nlog the fact that the dispatching\nprocess was\nsuccessful that is how we created the\ndispatcher\nprocess now we'll create a perform\nusing robotic Enterprise framework what\nit does is it get items from the queue\nand\nprocesses\n[Music]\nso in the dispatcher process let's go to\nthe initialization State\nfirst so we'll understand initialization\nstate in detail so the entire init block\nis kept inside the TR catch if you go to\nthe documents\nhere and if you go to the data folder\nyou can see a config file\nhere so config file this is the file we\nuse in the init state it has three\nsheets settings constants and\nassets you can give any value whatever\nyou want for maximum retry number the\nvalue should be zero when you're working\nwith your orchestrator cues the value\nshould be zero so this config file is\nstored in the data\nfolder and it has three sheets settings\nconstants and\nassets this is the Q name process ABC Q\nso let's get back to\nthe teamwork\nso we are initializing system error if\nthe error is nothing it will go to the\nnext state if first run read local\nconfiguration file you can see by\ndefault there are many variables\ncreated you should know them and utilize\nthem whenever required the config\nvariable the value type is dictionary\ntype config is nothing if you go here\nyou can see here config is nothing\ninitially there is no value so initially\nconfig is nothing then it will invoke in\nit all settings\nworkflow let's open this first\nrun so it will invoke in it all settings\nworkflow to see this workflow click on\nopen workflow it has three\narguments has three arguments in config\nfile in config sheets and out config\nthis is of type string type string and\nout config is of type\ndis and direction this is both are input\nand this is\noutput let's open the workflow and\nunderstand so basically what this\nworkflow does is this workflow outputs\nsetting dictionary with the key value\npairs to be used in the project settings\nare referred from the local cont config\nfile and then first from the\norchestrator assets assets will override\nthe config file\nsettings in all settings workflow invoke\nto initialize all settings and data for\napplication and process used in this\npart the setting consent and Assets in\nthe config file from the data folder are\nread in the initialize all settings so\nlet's go back the orchestrator Q name\nfrom the from the configuration file in\nthe argument case case is specified then\nit provides a backward\ncompatibility next we have invo kill\nprocess if we go to the arguments\nhere we can see the orchestrator Q name\nyou can assign a q name here if you have\ncreated a\nque so Ino kill\nprocess next we have invoke kill process\nit is a logging activity called killing\nprocess depending on the project you can\nadd activity it is a logging activity\ncalled killing process depending on the\nproject you can add\nactivities add add log fields in add log\nFields if you want to add any details in\nthe log file then you can do do it using\nall log Fields any tall\napplications workflow in this workflow\ninvoke to open apps and check their\nstatus credentials and so\non and that there are two transitions in\nthis when it is successful it gets\ntransition to get trans section data\nwhen there is a system exception it goes\nto the end\nprocess so so in short what\ninitialization state does is at the end\nof this workflow that is the\ninitialization state it reads the config\nfile and stores the key and value inside\nthe dictionary that is the out config\nout config dictionary variable has all\nconfig Excel file\ndata let's see the get transaction\ndata when you are in the orchestrator\nand you want to immediately stop a job\nfrom for some reason when a job is\nstopped this activity gets activated\nthere is a variable created should\nstop if it's a Boolean variable by\ndefault it's false when it gets\nactivated the value becomes yes then it\nwill go to the lock stop message as uh\nstop process\nrequested and it will end the process\nwhen the transaction item is nothing\nelse it will go to the try get\ntransaction\ndata here there it has seven\narguments and let's see the workflow\ninvoke get transaction data workflow\nclick on open\nworkflow it gets the data from the\nspreadsheets databases email web API or\nuipath server cues if no new data items\nthen set out the transaction item to\nnothing if a new transaction item is\nretrieved then it gets the additional\ninformation about it it gives the\ncondition where out transaction item is\nnot nothing then it will add the\ntransaction information to the log\nFields it is about the get transaction\ndata workflow in process transaction\nState the process is a sequence with a\ntry catch Activity Set to catch both\nsystem exceptions and business\nexceptions inside the tri block the\nprocess transaction workflow invoke that\nhas simple process like to attach the UI\ndemo application and three type in\nactivities to fill in and click accept\nbutton and if you see look at the\ntransitions it has three transition\nsystem exception whose destination is\nthe initialization State business\nexception goes back to the get\ntransaction data and success it goes to\nthe get transaction data finally the end\nprocess state where the applications is\nclosed what is web\nautomation the concept of allowing\nsoftware robots to do predefined actions\nactivities and procedures on a web\nbrowser or an online application is\nknown as web automation web automation\ncan help with the operations like form\nfilling screen scraping data extraction\nand transfer across apps websites and\ntesting and periodic report prepar\na features of web Automation in\nuipath uipath is compatible with all\nwebs it is compatible with HTML Ajax\nJava silver light and\nPDF automated data entry data entry from\nan Excel spreadsheet to website can be\nautomated in uip\npath it provides simple web testing\nwithout any programming knowledge uip\npaath helps in designing a valid\ntest no coding is required we can create\nautomation with a simple to use\ngraphical workflow\ndesigner playback Precision uipath\nprovides 100% playback Precision web\nautomation can be done regardless of the\nbrowser version screen position or\nsize how does web automation work in uip\npaath a built-in recorder in uip paath\nweb automation can read an Implement web\nbased activities it uses attributes to\nidentify web items and manipulates them\naccurately while keeping up with PID\nchanges it can be used with any website\nno matter how sophisticated and can be\ninstalled remotely through the network\nthe graphical workflow editor is simple\nto use and does not require any coding\nknowledge it's something that any user\nwith no programming experience can do\nyou save time and money by autom ating\nweb based workflows with UI\npath let's look at the demo so in this\ndemo we will scrape data from the simply\nlearns website we'll go to Simply learns\nwebsite so consider a scenario where a\ncustomer wants to know details about a\nparticular\ncourse suppose if I want to know all the\nUI path related resources that are\npresent on the website so I'll search as\nuip path\nand I'll select all free resources that\nare available on the website so here you\ncan see there are 27 results 27 free\nresources available on the simply Lun\nwebsite so I'll scrape all of this data\nso using data scraping option in uipath\nI'll scrape the resource name along with\nthe type whether it's an article or\nvideo tutorial and along with that I'll\nscrape the URL so I'll scrape all these\nthree things and copy it in in the Excel\nsheet and the Excel sheet over and mail\nI'll send it to the\ncustomer so let's get started so let's\njump into uip part studio and get\nstarted with the demo so let's create a\nnew\nflowchart we'll name the flowchart as\nweb\nautomation since we are showing this\ndemo under web\nautomation so a new flowchart is created\nso in this blow chart we will drag and\ndrop a sequence\nactivity right\nclick right click and select as set a\nstart\nnode so open the\nsequence and drag and drop an open\nbrowser\nactivity in the open brows browser\nactivity select the browser\ntype select the whichever browser you\nwant I'll select\nChrome and uh one more thing you need to\ndo is go to home go to tools and install\nthe uip path extensions click on Chrome\nand if you want to continue installing\nuipath extension for Chrome please close\nall your Chrome process then click on\nokay so then click on okay and your uip\npath extension for Chrome will get\ninstalled\nso since I have already installed I'll\nclick on\ncancel when after installing when you\nopen Chrome so your screen will look\nlike this so where you have to enable\nthe extension click on enable extension\nand the Chrome extension will be\ninstalled in your\ndevice okay so let's come back to U part\nstudio so select the open browser select\nthe browser where you want to get it\ninstalled so let's create a variable\nhere let's create a variable as website\nURL let's go to variable and enter the\nURL so let's go to\nthe simply larns\nwebsite and copy the\nURL once the URL is copied so this open\nbrowser activity is a container that\nenables you to open a browser at a\nspecified URL and execute multiple\nactivities with within it\nso we have selected the open browser so\ninside the open browser activity we will\ndrag and drop maximize window\nactivity maximize window it maximizes\nthe indicated\nwindow so after this next we need to\ndrag and drop type into\nactivity so we'll drag and drop type\ninto\nactivity bring it\noutside bring it outside the open\nbrowser indicate on the screen the first\nthing is we need to select the search\nbar so we'll select the search bar and\nwhat we are entering here is uip paths\nsince we are searching for uip path\ncourse so enter uip path and after\nentering uip path we need to click on\nenter\nso we need to enter to search the uip\npath related resources so click on this\nplus button and select the enter\noption select\nenter so separate this concatenate\nit okay so this is done so once in the\nbrowser after entering UI part\nthe next thing we need to do is click on\nthis free resources click on this all\noption check this box so for that what\nwe have to do\nis search for click option click\nactivity and select this click\nactivity indicate on\nscreen and select this\nclick so this is done next thing what we\nneed to do is when we click here on all\nwe find 27 results so when we do it\nautomatically when The Bard does this\nwhen the robot does this thing it does\nnot go down and refresh all the results\nwhat it does is uh when it opens this\npage without loading the below results\nhow much of results are available some\n10 results it will copy only those 10\nresults it will not refresh and copy the\nresults which are below so for that what\nwe have to do is we will go to uod\nStudio we will select drag and drop one\nmore type\ninto\nactivity and we'll indicate on\nscreen we'll scroll down till the\nbottom and we'll simply select this\nblank\nscreen just because so that the every\ntime the robot comes into this page it\ngoes till the bottom and copies all the\nresults that is why we select simply a\nblank screen here and it is showing an\nerror we have to enter something here so\nwe'll select uh command say since we are\nscrolling it down we'll select down and\nthis much is\ndone so go back to the flow\nchart which we had created Automation\nand we'll drag and drop a new sequence\nso till here it's done where we are\nopening the simply learns website and\nsearching for UI path next we what we'll\ndo is we will scrape the data so we'll\nrename it as data\nscraping we'll open this sequence so\ndata scraping is something where we\nextract structure data from a browser\napplication or a document to a data\ntable so we'll click on data\nscraping so we'll open the browser so we\nhave opened the browser now we'll select\nthe data which we want to extract so\nclick on next scroll\nup so first we'll select the resource\nname so we'll select top UI path\ninterview questions to create a pattern\nwe need to indicate a similar field\npreferably the last in the collection or\nthe second one so what we'll do is we'll\nselect the second\none and we can create a column and we'll\nname the column as\nresources if you want you can take the\nURL we'll take the URL before that we'll\ntake the type so these are the resources\nthe 27 resources\nif the maximum number of results it will\ngo to is 100 if we enter 100 here if you\nwant more than 100 you can remove this\n100 and keep it as zero so it will\nselect all zero for all so after this\nwe'll extract correlated\ndata this time we will extract the type\nwhether it's an article or it's the\nvideo tutorial click on\narticle and indicate the similar field\nfor the next one we'll select video\ntutorial so this column we name it as\ntype and we will extract the URL of each\nresource and we will name the column as\nsay link links okay\nnext and we are done so enter on\nfinish is data spanning multiple pages\nin our case there is is no multiple\nPages there is only one page in case if\nthere are multiple Pages you can click\non yes here press s to indicate it\nscroll down and select the next\npages but since in this page there is\nonly one page so we'll click on\nno okay this much is done we have\nscraped data so after the data scraping\nis done we want to copy this scrape data\ninto an Excel sheet so to copy it in the\nExcel sheet we need Excel application\nscope so we'll search for Excel\napplication scope\nactivity so Excel application scope\nactivity opens an Excel workbook\nproviding a scope for Excel activities\nwhen this activity ends the workbook and\nExcel applications are closed if this\nspecified file does not exist a new\nExcel file is created so for this Excel\napplication scope so we'll go to desktop\ngo to new and create a new Microsoft\nExcel worksheet\nwe'll name it as uip\npath uip part\ndetails so we have created a\nfile we'll go back to the uip\nstudio now we'll select the file which\nwe had\ncreated we'll go to desktop and select\ntheile uip part details and we'll click\non open next we will drag and drop right\nrange\nactivity we'll search\nfor right range\nactivity bring it inside the\ndo and by default it is sheet 1 and\nA1 so right range activity writes the\ndata from a data table in a spreadsheet\nstarting from the cell\nif the starting cell isn't specified the\nwriting begins at A1 cell so once that\nis done now we need to enter the\nvariable that is extract data table\nvariable which we extracted here that is\nthis variable extract data\ntable we need to enter this\nvariable go here and search for extract\ndata table variable so this much is done\nwe have scraped data from the simply lar\nwebsite right then using the Excel\napplications scope we have written the\ndata in the Excel sheet so let's run\ntill here and see whether it's scraping\nthe data and writing in the Excel\nsheet so we'll save it and click on run\nso let's see we'll close\nthis here you can see it's opening the\nsimply Lars website entering uip path\noops we have made an error okay let's go\nand let's stop\nhere so we had made an error here the\nbracket was missing it is why now we\nhave corrected it let's save and\nrun for that close\nthis so opening the simply lunch website\nit will enter uip path select all the\nfree resources then it will copy this in\nthe Excel sheet\nyou can see it's\ncopying so let's open the Excel\nworksheet which we created and let's\ncheck if it has copied so you can see in\nthe Excel file which we had created the\ndata has been scraped and copied here\nthe First Column it is the course name\nor the resource name which we had copied\nin the second column it is the type\nwhether it is an article or video\ntutorial and the third column it is the\nURL\nthere are no headers here right we can\ngive the headers so we'll go to the uip\nstudio and if you click on Excel\napplication scope or right range here\nyou can see add headers so click here\nand the headress will be added in the\nExcel sheet so this much is done now\nnext step is we need to send this Excel\nfile over and mail so to send this Excel\nfile over and mail let's go to\nactivities let's drag and drop a new\nsequence we'll use a separate sequence\nto send the activities over a\nmail sorry not\nhere use a\nseparate we'll connect\nthis we'll name this activity\nas mail since we are sending it our\nmail open this sequence\nthe first activity we need here is get\npassword\nactivity so search for get\npassword tag and drop it get password\nactivity encrypts a password by\nassociating it with the current user\nonly workflows running under the current\nuser context can decrypt the password so\ngo to the password and enter your email\nID\npassword and and in the result create a\nnew variable and store the password in a\nvariable so that your password is\nencrypted and name the variable\nas\npassw short form something\npassword and next activity we need is\nsend SMTP mail message so double click\non send smtv mail\nmessage so this activity basically sends\nan email message by using the SMTP\nprotocol so go to the port and enter the\nport which is\n587 and go to the server and enter the\nserver\nsmtp.gmail.com\nand enter the email ID to which you want\nto send the mail\nenter the password the password variable\nwhich we had created enter that and\nenter the email ID here as\nwell so enter the subject of the mail\nwhat you what you want the subject to be\nso I'll name it as course details\nand enter the\nbody so I'll enter a simple\nhello\nhello here are the\ndetails\nokay so there is a prerequisite for this\nuh you have to to receive or to send an\nemail you have to go to your Google\naccount that is the email account\nsecurity option and there you have to\nturn on secured access go to the option\ncalled secured access and turn it\non okay next we need to attach the file\nthe file which we want to send it over\nand mail attach the file in which we had\nscraped the data from the simply learns\nwebsite so let's go to web automation\nthe previous sequence and copy the file\npath from the Excel applications scod so\nwe'll copy this file\npath\nand go back in the attach\nfile we will paste this\npath move one double\ncode Okay click on\nokay next we'll drag and drop a message\nbox just for like our reference to show\na message so that the process is\ncompleted so we'll enter a simple\nmessage in the message box like the\ncourse details have been mailed\nsuccessfully so correct let me correct\nthis\nspelling details\nokay so now there are no errors so now\nthe project is\ncomplete so what I have done is I have\ntaken a flowchart in the flowchart I\nhave taken a first sequence in this\nsequence I'm opening the browser the\nsimply learns browser I'm maximizing it\nthen I am know type using the type into\nactivity I'm recording the search bar in\nthe search bar I'm entering the UI path\nand clicking on enter so after clicking\non enter I'll select the all option\nwhere I'll select all the\nresources in the first sequence then in\nthe second sequence I'm scraping the\ndata in scraping data option I'll scrape\nthe data I'll scrape the course name the\ntype and the URL then in the Excel\napplication scope I'll copy all the\nscrape data in an Excel file so I'll use\nan Excel application scope I have\ncreated a file so in that file I'll\nwrite the scrape data in the second\nsequence then finally in the third\nsequence I am using the get password\nactivity and send SMTP mail message and\nI'm sending it over an email I'm sending\nthe Excel file as an attachment with an\nemail to the customer this message box\nsimply indicates that the mail has been\nsuccessfully sent okay now let me save\nand click on run so I'll close the\nprevious\nbrowser let me save and click on run web\nautomation execution is started it is\ngoing to the\nbrowser went to Simply learn website\nsearch for UI path click on all\nresources and it's copying the resources\nin an Excel\nsheet after copying the resource in an\nExcel sheet it is sending over an email\nso it has sent over an email and the\nmessage has been displayed the course\ndetails have been successfully mailed\nlet me go to my email inbox and check\nwhether I have received\nit so let me click on course detail have\nbeen ma successful y Let me\nrefresh and here you can see I have\nreceived the mail let me open this\nfile so here you can see I have received\nthe file which consist of resources the\ntype and the link what is Excel\nautomation Excel automation is a task\nautomation involving Excel files Studio\nX enables the creation of automation\nproject involving various types of data\nfrom an Excel file using various\nspecialized activities to create an\nExcel automation we must use Excel file\nresource when creating a new project\nthat includes Excel an Excel file must\nbe specified within it so that all of\nthe subsequent actions can access the\ndata contained within that\nfile why use an Excel\nautomation uip paath allows you to\nautomate excel in various ways such as\nExcel application scope activities and\nworkbook activities Excel automation\nsimplifies your application by\nperforming task such as formatting cells\nupdating values and running macros\nautomatically Excel task in automated\nprocess can also be integrated with\nseveral other functions across the\nEnterprise using an RPA solution the\nbenefit of excel Automation in general\nis that it can save people many hours\nspent manually comp completing task\nadvantages of excel\nautomation productivity Excel automation\nprovides higher production rates and\nincrease productivity efficiency some of\nthe functions of excel can easily create\nautomated task and custom logic with\nfunctions like macros macros are an\nexcellent way to save time on\npredictable repetitive task hence Exel\nautomation is efficient better product\nquality quality Exel automation improves\nquality in several ways including\neliminating human error increasing\nconsistency and accuracy the ability to\ncreate more complex projects and the\ndetection of mistakes along the way\nimproved safety Excel allows you to\nprotect your work whether it's to\nprevent someone from opening a workbook\nwithout a password to Grant readon\naccess to a workbook or to Simply\npreserve a worksheet so you don't delete\nany\ndata reduced labor Excel automation will\nperform all the repetitive task more\naccurately and productively than humans\nthus reduces labor reduce lead time a\nlead time is the amount of time that\nelapses between the start and finish of\na process Excel automation reduces the\nlead time let's look how to install an\nExcel package let's jump into the UI\npart Studio to install an Excel package\ngo to the manage\npackages you can see the packages that\nare installed go to all packages and\nsearch for uipath Excel\nactivities by default an updated version\nwill be installed if the Excel package\nis not installed you can install it from\nhere so in my device this activity is\nalready\ninstalled this is the place from where\nyou can install any activities or any\npackages let's see some of the commonly\nused Excel\nactivities these are some of the\ncommonly used Excel activities redrain\nselect range save workbook autofield\nrange copy paste range insert and delete\ncolumns so insert inserting a column at\nthe specified location in a sheet or a\ntable or a range and to delete a column\nyou can delete it from a specified range\nor the\ntable there are filters filter table so\nwhat filters does is you can use the\nfilter action to create a filter in a\nRange table or a sheet based on the\nvalues in a single column we also have V\nlookup V lookup which stands for\nvertical lookup is an Excel feature that\nenabled searches and retrieves data from\na specified column we will explore all\nof these activities in the demo section\nin detail let's look at the demo in this\ndemo we have an Excel sheet that has a\nrecord of covid cases in five states of\nIndia in\n2021 so we will create an Excel\nautomation to represent the number of\ncases in\ncharts it's easy to understand looking\nat the the charts rather than looking at\nthe huge\nnumbers then we will upload the file on\nthe drive so let's jump into the uip\npart studio and get\nstarted this is the Excel file which I\nhave created it has all the number of\ncases in these five states in the year\n2021 the month of Jan Feb March and\nApril all this record I have taken it\nfrom a website called PRS india.org\nso I have two sheets sheet one and Sheet\ntwo so let's jump into the uip\nstudio to start off with the demo we\nneed to have the three packages\ninstalled one is the uipath Excel\nactivities package the other one is\nuipath g. activities this activity this\npackage is used for drive to upload on\nthe drive then\nthe other package is balara Excel\nactivities this package is used for bar\ngraph and pie\nchart so after installing this three\npackages we'll get\nstarted so let's create a new\nsequence name it as\nsequence 2\nso first we'll drag and drop an Excel\napplication\nscope so Excel application scope what it\ndoes is it opens an Excel workbook and\nsets the scope for Excel activities when\nthis activity is completed the specified\nworkbook and the Excel application are\nclosed when the workbook application\nvariable is specified in the output\nworkbook activities field the\nspreadsheet is not\nclosed after this drag and drop uh\ncreate table\nactivity so by default we have sheet one\nand enter the\nrange so the range is in this Excel\nsheet the range is from A1 to\nF5 so enter the range\nfor this we need to enter the file path\nso we'll select the\nfile so we have selected the file we\nhave entered\nthe enter the table name\nsay number of cases\n[Music]\nso once this much is done next we'll\ndrag and drop a bar\nchart drop it outside the Excel\napplication scope and select the file\npart so select the\nfile so select the file select this cell\nrange that is the same range what we had\nentered\nearlier A1 to\nF5 so once that is done if the chart\ntitle say\nthises and you can select the chart type\nbar stack 3D clustered 3D stack whatever\nis required for now we'll select bar\ncluster we have many other options to\nexplore data label\ntype we'll keep it\nin show value so that it shows the\nvalue and select show\nvalue you want show percentage then\nselect\npercentage we'll select show Legend and\nsize can vary the size accordingly how\nmuch you want so I'll keep the size\nas\n350 to\n350 you can change the\nwidth so the bar chart is done and you\ncan enter the sheet which sheet are you\nusing so it's sheet\none now we drag and drop p\nchart select the\nfile similarly enter the options\nhere enter the cell range the same\nrange A1 is to\nF5 show percent we will show\nvalue show\nLegend select show\nvalue and select the sheet which you\nwant we'll select the sheet two\nso done so we have completed till here\nnext we need to upload this on the\nGoogle Drive so we'll select this option\nupload\nfile select the\nfile we have selected defile so select\ndestination\nfolder for that go to your Google Drive\naccount so we'll go\nthere so in my drive I have created a\nfolder called Excel automation so I'll\ncopy this\nURL till here not the entire\ncopy\nthis and go to your uip studio and paste\nit in the destination\nfolder double\nquotes then create a variable\nand create a variable as\nF oops there is an error we have\nforgotten to use a git\napplication this can be only used inside\na git application so drag and drop a git\napplication and inside git\napplication we'll write this so the\nerror is\ngone so we'll run the file now\nwe'll save\nit and\nrun you can see the file is\ngetting\nrun so the execution is\nended we will\nnavigate to the\ndrive so here you can see the file is\nsuccessfully uploaded we'll open the\nfile\nit's working on the\ngraph here you go here you can see the\nbar graph so the sheet one with the\nvalues number of values in each state\nwasse and for Sheet two we created a pie\nchart so here you go here you can see\nthe pie chart let's begin by\nunderstanding who is an RPA\ndeveloper now generally speaking an RPA\ndeveloper is someone who works cross\nfunctionally with business operations\nand business analysts to create and\noptimized workflow processes however\nthis is a relatively new career path and\nmany organizations formal titles for RPA\ndevelopers differ now other similar\npositions may include titles like\nprocess designer or automation architect\nbut no matter the title the role of a\nsuccessful RPA developer involves to\ndesign develop and implement RPA systems\nin order to automate a business process\nan RPA developer will be required to\ncreate workflow diagrams and\nstrategically document the\nimplementation he's also responsible for\nbug fixes so coding skills are important\nnow in order to be a successful RPA\ndeveloper you must have the ability to\nnavigate various appropriate\nTechnologies such as UI part or\nautomation\nanywhere next up is RPA growth\nprojections now looking at the curve\nboth RPA software and services increased\nby huge amounts between 2016 and 2020\nand Beyond according to Nexon research\nknowledge and work automation could have\nan economic impact of about 5 to 7\ntrillion us do by the year 2025 it will\ntouch more than 230 million knowledge\nworkers which constitute up to 9% of the\nglobal Workforce Now any company which\nis labor intensive where people are\nperforming high volume High transaction\nfunctions will boost their capabilities\nand save money and time without us\nnow that we've established that RPA has\na steep growth curve let's look at the\nRPA job roles that you should look out\nfor we have the RPA developer senior RPA\ndeveloper RPA process architect RPA\ndeveloper senior consultant project\nmanager thead developer business analyst\nand RPA data\nanalyst now these job roles come with\nspecific responsibilities depending on\nthe\ndesignation however there are a few\ncommon responsibilities of an RPA\ndeveloper let's go ahead and check them\nout now the first one is strategic\nplanning skills now planning is a\ncrucial phase in any development life\ncycle the RPA developer regardless of\nthe designation should possess the\naptitude to ensure strategic planning\nplanning includes the design development\nand implementation of RPA systems this\nalso helps streamline the\nbusiness next up is strong analytical\nskills now to understand the client's\nrequirements and cater to the needs\naccordingly is crucial analytical skills\nare also important to predict or\nidentify potential bugs and errors and\nrectify them now this skill is\nespecially required if you're involved\nin the overall\ndevelopment next we have problem solving\nskills now this again is extremely\ncrucial to predict any outages and equip\nthe entire unit to overcome any unforced\ninterruptions from the business\nperspective as well problem solving\nskills clear a significant role in\nensuring smooth conduction of\ntasks experience in any programming\nlanguage such as C C++ python Ruby Java\nor net is also\nimportant handson experience on RPA\ntools and cognitive platforms such as\nblue prism automation anywhere UI PA\nopen span Etc is necessary communication\nskills are pivital for any organization\nthe developer should be outspoken and\narticulate any new ideas you should also\nbe confident to raise concerns and be as\ntransparent as possible in the long run\nthis only proves to be helpful to the\norganization lastly we have exposure to\nSQL now experience with database be it\nSQL or no SQL is highly preferred it's\nalways an added Advantage if you have\nthe knowledge about accessing and\nmanaging\ndatabases next up we have RPA developer\nsalaries now the salaries will differ\ndepending on your location your\nexperience and also the\ndesignation now in the US here are the\njob salties and the roles according to\nglass door an RPA developer in the US\nearns around $76,000 us per year an RPA\ndeveloper senior consultant earns around\n$99,000 per year nrpa process architect\nearns an average salary of\n$95,000 and a senior RPA developer earns\nan average salary of $92,000\nan RPA project manager earns around\n$73,000 per anom an RPA lead developer\nearns an average salary of\n$99,000 perom nrpa business analyst\nearns around\n$68,000 perom and the data analyst earns\naround $62,000 us per anom moving on to\nIndia the average salary of an RPA\ndeveloper is around 5 lak 98,000 rupees\nthat of a senior consultant a senior RPA\ndeveloper and an RPA lead developer is\naround 14 lakhs per anom and the average\nsalary of an RPA business analyst is\naround 540,000\nrupees now let me quickly run you\nthrough a sample resume of an RPA\ndeveloper now this is just a template\nand you can alter it according to your\nneeds first up is your general\ninformation like name phone number and\nyour email ID then you can give a quick\ndescription about yourself and your\nstrengths you can also mention the\nobjective as to why you're applying and\nwhat you're looking for in the\norganization you can include your\nLinkedIn profile link and your GitHub\nlink one look at your LinkedIn profile\nis enough for anybody to gather all the\ninformation necessary so make sure that\nit's updated moving on you could mention\nyour experience now here you would have\nto mention the names of your previous\norganizations along with your\ndesignation and the tenure you can also\ninclude your key responsibilities in\nthese\norganizations along with the\nresponsibility you could also mention\nthe awards that you've received in your\norganizations next up is your\neducational background you can mention\nthe university that you graduated from\nand is required that you have a degree\nin computer science you can also go\nahead and mention your GPA the next\nsection is skills now this is pretty\ncrucial in the technical skills section\nyou could mention about different RPA\ntools that you've worked on if you're\ngood at a particular programming\nlanguage go ahead and mention that as\nwell as mentioned earlier any any\nexperience in database management is an\nadded Advantage if you have any\nexperience go ahead and mention that\nmoving on to non-technical skills you\ncould mention any extracurricular\nactivities that you're proud of some\nsoft skills that you feel worth\nmentioning can be added in this section\nmentioning the languages that you know\ncan also boost your resume now given all\nthis it's fundamental that you do not\nlie on your\nresume all right then with that we\nconclude this session I hope it gave you\na clear understanding of the subject you\nare path assist business in successfully\nautomating their business process if\nyou're planning to attend an interview\nfor an RPA or UI part developer role\nhere is a comprehensive list of most\nfrequently Asked uipath interview\nquestions with\nanswers what is\nuipath this question looks simple but\npeople most of the time end up giving\nwrong definition uip path is a robotic\nprocess automation tool for large scale\nend to-end automation for an accelerated\nbusiness change it provides solution for\nbusiness to automate routine office\nactivities it uses a variety of methods\nto transform TDS task into automated\nprocess what are the different\ncomponents in uipath uip paath consists\nof three components mainly uipath studio\nuipath studio is a userfriendly\ninterface that allows users to visually\nplan and design various automation\nprocess through diagrams using the drag\nand draw\nfunctionality these diagrams are merily\na structure Cal reflection of specific\ntask that must be\ncompleted UI path robot after you have\nbuilt your process the next move is to\nput into action in the uipath studio\nuipath robots are used to translate the\nstrategies into task which are then\nexecuted these robots are used to assign\nvarious task and carry them out in the\nsame manner as humans but without human\ninterference when given operation occurs\non the computer they program uip paath\nrobots to begin EX excuting task\nautomatically uip paath orchestrator the\norchestrator is a web- based application\nin uip path it has features for\ndeploying monitoring scheduling and\ncontrolling automated Bots and process\nit's a centralized forum for managing\nand maintaining all software\nBots what are the different workflows in\nuip sequences a sequence is a small type\nof project that is best suited for\nlinear process it enables developers to\ntransition from one activity to another\neasily they can be reused numerous\ntimes flowchart it can be used for large\nor small projects that help in\ndevelopment of complex business and\nconnecting activities in a variety of\nways flowcharts assist in the\npresentation of multiple branches of\nlogical\noperators State machine a state machine\nis a machine that uses a certain number\nof states for automation during\nexecution it will only change States if\nan action is performed on it let's look\nat the next question what is a uipath\nrobot the robot is a uipath's execution\nagent allowing you to run process\ncreated in the studio in order to\nexecute process robots must be connected\nto the orchestrator or license\nlocally what are the different\ncomponents of uip paath robot sir\nservice the robot service is the primary\ncontroller for all operations it\ncommunicates with Studio the robot agent\nand the robot command line interface by\nan interprocess Communication channel to\nreceive and process\ninformation executor the robot executor\nis the component that is directly\nresponsible for process execution the\nrobot service creates a robot executor\ninstance every time a job is\nstarted command line interface\nthe robot command line interface is a\nconsole application that starts jobs and\nwaits for their\nresults uipath assistant is a tool\ndesigned specifically to improve the\nusers interaction with our robots from\nthe comfort of the desktop it is where\nusers can easily access manage and run\nautomation with a few\nclicks what is the difference between\nattended and unattended robot\nattended robots are supervised robots\nthat humans operate they work on the\nsame workstation as a human user and is\ntriggered by user\nevents unattended robots unattended\nrobots are those that do not require\nhuman supervision to perform task they\nrun in Virtual environments without\nhuman control and can automate any\nnumber of\nprocess what are the features of uipath\ndrag and drop workflow the uip path user\nwill develop visual process steps by\ndragging and dropping related task onto\nthe graphical workspace then with the\nuser interface properties they can\ntransform these process steps into a\nvisual workflow users may also use the\nrecorder wizard in the UI part tool to\nbuild web based or application\nworkflow record and Playback the user\ncan use this function to record actions\nand transform them into an automated\nprocess\nSeries in build AC activities in uip\npaath uip paath comes with over 300\nbuilt-in activities covering a wide\nrange of process Automation and\napplication integrated design task you\ncan find these activities in activity\nSpain which covers most design tasks\nsuch as data extraction data entry and\nautomation Advanced scraping options\nscraping data from web pages and\napplications is more accessible with uip\npath screen scraping furthermore the\ndata scraping wizard helps in the\nscraping of data with a repeative\nstructure scraping solution Works\nflawlessly with any program including\nnet Java flash PDF Legacy and sap high\nsecurity and robustness you can create\nsuper smart durable robots with uipath\nvisual canvas everyone in the company\ncan use these bards uipath offers high\nsecurity Auto login functionality to run\nthe Bots and operates with a loged\nscreen allowing automated process to run\nin complete\nprivacy what are the different recording\noptions in uip\npath basic recording it focuses on\nautomating single task and is commonly\nused to develop each activity's complete\nselector desktop recording it can be\nused for a variety of actions as well as\napplication\ndevelopment web recording web recording\nis a standard tool for viewing and\nrecording web activities Citrix\nrecording it is very widely used for\nrecording stuff like pictures and\nvirtualized environment\nautomation what is a manage package in\nuipath the package manager functionality\nallows to download activities packages\nlibraries Frameworks wrappers and others\nand View and update the ones already\ninstalled for the project and add and\nremove\nit it displays the list of available\npackages per feed and a list of\ndependencies for the current\nproject the manage package Windows\nalways opens with the project\ndependencies\nlist how to publish a project in\nuipath to publish a project in U iPod\nfirst create a new\nproject then in the design ribbon tab\nclick publish the publish window will\nopen in the package properties tab enter\nthe name for package then click next in\nthe publish options tab select the\nlocation where you want to publish your\nproject and finally the information\ndialog box displays so let's see a demo\nhow is it done so let's jump in the uip\nstudio so here we are in uod\nstudio let's open our\nworkflow I'll drag and drop a simple\nmessage box just to\nshow enter a message\nsay\nhey so I have created a simple workflow\njust to show you how to publish project\nin uip\npart so here you can see the publish\noption once you have created the project\ngo to the ribbon Tab and click on the\npublish when you click the publish\nwindow opens\nhere you can change the package name if\nyou want you can see the version new\nversion package icon and release notes\nso let's click on\nnext here you will get the custom URL\nwhere you want to publish\nto then click on\npublish here you go you can see\npublishing\npackage so a info dialog box appears\nproject publish\nsucessfully if you want you can copy to\nthe\nclipboard so this is how the project is\npublished in the UI\npath what is data scraping and Screen\nscraping data scraping is the process of\nextracting structured data from a\nbrowser application or document and\nsaving it to a database or a CSV file or\neven an Excel\nspreadsheet screen scraping methods are\nactivities that allow data to be\nextracted from a specific UI element or\ndocument such as a PDF\nfile explain the different types of\nAutomation in\nuipath Excel automation Excel automation\nis a useful tool for sorting deleting\nretrieving and analyzing data it is\nsimple to migrate and integrate data\ninto\nplatforms Studio X has a strong\nintegration with Microsoft Excel and\nships with several activities that\nautomate Excel\ntask mail automation enables task\nautomation with emails from the Outlook\ndesktop application Gmail and Outlook\n365 add the activities that use data\nfrom the account inside the resource\nactivity after adding the account to the\nautomation as a resource using a used\nOutlook 365 use Gmail\nor use desktop Outlook app\nactivity word Automation in the word\nautomation add the word document to be\nworked on by using a word file activity\nand then add the word activities to\nautomate within the use Word file\nPowerPoint\nautomation PowerPoint automation allows\nthe user to automate the most common\ntask in PowerPoint presentation add the\npresentation to work with the used\nPowerPoint presentation activity and\nthen inside the use PowerPoint\npresentation add the presentation\nactivities to\nautomate file automation it refers to\nthe automation of task performed on your\ncomputer with files and folders such as\ncreating copying or renaming files and\nfolders Studio X includes several\nactivities that automate task that you\nperform with files and\nfolders CSV\nAutomation in CSV automation add the CSV\nactivities inside the use Excel file\nactivity where the Excel file is defined\nto move data between CSV and\nExcel explain a few read and write\nactivities read range read range reads\nthe values of an Excel range and stores\nin a data table variable read cell reads\nthe values of an Excel cell and stores\nin a variable read CSV reads all entries\nfrom a specific F CSV file right range\nwrites data from a data table variable\nto a\nspreadsheet right cell writes a value or\nformula into a specified spreadsheet\ncell right CSV overwrites a specify data\ntable to a CSV\nfile what is an Excel application\nscope Excel application scope opens an\nExcel workbook and sets the scope for\nExcel activities when this activity is\ncompleted the specified workbook and\nExcel application are\nclosed what is an\norchestrator uipath orchestrator is a\nweb application that orchestrates the\nexecution of repeative\nprocess it manages the creation\nmonitoring scheduling and controlling of\nbots and process\nit can manage the entire robot\nFleet name some orchestrator\ncapabilities provisioning provisioning\nestablishes and maintains the connection\nbetween the robots and the web\napplication deployment ensures that it\ndelivers the correct package versions to\nthe assigned robots for\nexecution configuration looks after the\nmaintenance and delivery of robot\nenvironments and process\nconfiguration qes Q's ensures that it\nautomatically distributes the workload\nacross robots monitoring manages user\npermissions and keeps track of robot\nrecognition details logging locks are\nstored and indexed in an SQL\ndatabase explain process job asset and\nQ the process page allows you you to\nbuild new process from uploaded packages\nmanaging existing process and keep all\nof your process up to date with the\nlatest package\nversion jobs on an uip paath Robo a job\nrepresents the execution of procedure it\ncan start the execution of job in either\nattended or unattended mode Q's a q is a\nstorage container that can accommodate\nan infinite number of objects multiple\ntypes of data such as invoice\ninformation or customer data are stored\nin Q objects other systems such as sap\nor Salesforce are used to process this\ndata assets assets are usually shared\nvariables or credentials that can be\nused through several automation projects\nthey allow you to store unique\ninformation that the robots can easily\naccess how to connect a robot to the\norchestrator\nStep One open uipath Assistant step two\nsign in the uipath\norchestrator step three create a\ntenant step four connect the robot to\nthe\norchestrator and step five check the\nstatus it shows connected and licensed\nso let's see a demo of how to do this so\nlet's jump into the uip part\nStudio open you step one open uipath\nassistant so we'll open uipath\nAssistant after opening uipath assistant\nlog the uipath orchestrator so go to the\nbrowser go to the browser and type\nplatform. part.com\nthis will take to the uipath\nwebsite so sign in if you're new to this\nif you don't have the account then you\ncan enter all the details and login\nsince I have already created an account\nI'll sign\nin after logging in the uip paath\norchestrator go to the\nadmin here you can create a new tenant\nyou can add a tenant here and create a\nnew tenant since I have already created\na tenant named\nadmin so after creating a tenant connect\nthe robot to the\norchestrator go to the uip path\nassistant go to\npreferences go to\npreferences go to orchestrator\nsettings here you can see the status it\nis offline click on the signin button\nonce you click on the sign in\nbutton allow this open\nuipath here you can see it is\nconnecting and you can see it is\nconnected and license so the UI path\nRobo is now connected with the\norchestrate\nwhat is a tenant context and folder\ncontext in tenant context to view and\ncontrol tenant level entities in the\norchestrator pick tenant from the\nsidebar menu with only one instance of\nthe orchestrator multi tency allows\nisolating\ndata for the folder context from the\nsidebar menu pick any available folder\nto view and control the entities within\nthe data\nfolder so so I'll show you let's go to\nthe\norchestrator so let's go to the\norchestrator here you can see this is\nthe tenant\ncontext to view and control the tenant\nlevel entities in orchestrator you can\npick the tenant from the sidebar\nmenu from the sidebar menu pick any\navailable folder folder so these are the\nfolders pick any available folder to\nview and control the entities within\nthat folder so this is with respect to\nthe folder\ncontext what is an re\nframework the robotic Enterprise\nframework is a state machine based\nproject\ntemplate it allows to handle even the\nmost complex business situations it's\ndesigned to incorporate all of the\nindustry's best practice itic es for\nlogging exception management application\ninitialization and other\nareas what are the features of re\nframework settings during the\ninitialization phase of several process\nsome configuration settings and\nconfiguration values are frequently read\nlike URLs to a web application\norchestrator q names and default logging\nmessages logging\nthe built-in logging mechanism is\nanother helpful feature of the framework\nthe majority of the systems workflows\nuse log message activities to Output\ninformation about what is happening at\neach execution\nstage business exception if the issue is\nwith the data or any underlying business\nrequirement the system skips the\ntransaction and moves on to the next\nsuch exceptions are known as business\nexceptions application exception if the\nissue can be resolved by restarting\napplications the framework will do so\nautomatically and attempt to process the\ntransaction again search exceptions are\nknown as application\nexceptions how to merch two Excel files\ninto a single Excel\nfile first we need to create a\nsequence after creating a sequence we\nneed a few activities like read CSV\nactivity assign activity data table\nactivity and write CS file activity so\nwe'll drag and drop all these activities\nand do the process then we'll run the\nsequence and see the output so let's\njump into the uip part studio and start\nwith the\nworkflow so we are in the uip part\nStudio I have already created a sequence\nyou can go to new and create a sequence\nor press control n\nso after starting a sequence first we'll\ndrag and drop re CSV\nactivity since we are using two Excel\nfiles so we need to read CSV activity\nwe'll drag and drop another read CSV\nactivity so we'll select the location of\nthe first Excel file\nselect the first Excel\nfile I'll show you both the Excel files\nwhich we are merging so this is the\nfirst Excel file so it has five rows\nfive\nnames so we'll this is the first Excel\nfile\nand this is the second Excel files this\nExcel file has five different names and\nthe other Excel file has five different\nrows so these are the two Excel files we\nwill merge both these Excel files into a\nsingle new Excel\nfile so we'll close this Excel\nfiles so in the first read CSV activity\nwe have copied the location of the first\nExcel file in the output two we will\nselect this and create a variable right\nclick and create a variable and let's\nsay name the variable as slore\nfile1 we have named the\nvariable okay now we'll go to another\nread CSV file and select the location of\nthe second\nfile so I have downloaded this sample\nExcel files from the\ninternet just for the\ndemo right click and create variable\nlet's say name this variable as slore\nFile\n2 so now that we have dragged and drop\nto read CSV activities now next we need\nassign\nactivity so drag and drop assign\nactivity so assign activity has two\nparameters as you can see two and enter\na VB expression in the two parameter in\nthis right click and create a variable\nand name the\nvariable let's say\nmerged\ns now after naming the variable enter an\nexpression here so enter the expression\nas\nslore file 1 which is the variable for\nfile one select this and enter the\nexpression do clone\nwhat this clone function does is the\nClone function creates a new data table\nwith the same structure but does not\ncopy the data so we are creating a new\nExcel file that is the third file in\nwhich we are merging the data tables of\nboth the Excel file so the third Excel\nfile which we are creating will have the\nsame structure as the file one so this\nclone function creates a third Excel\nfile with the same structure as the file\none\nso it's showing an error so select this\nassign let's go to\nvariables here you can see variable type\nstring change it to system. dat. data\ntable and here you go the error is\ngone okay so now we have dragged and\ndropped assign activity the next\nactivity which we need is merge data\ntable activity\nlet's search for\nmerge data table\nActivity drag and drop merge data table\nactivity we need two merge data table\nactivity since we have two Excel\nfiles select the first merge data table\nactivity go to the\ndestination and enter the destination\nwhich is the variable which we created\nin the assign activity the\nmer so enter\nthis and enter the source file that is\nthe variable which we created in file\none that is\nslore file one similarly similarly go to\nmerge data\ntable and enter the same\ndestination but here the source will be\nthe second file\nokay now that we have dragged and drop\nto merge data tables the next activity\nwe need is WR CSV\nfile so we'll search for right CSV\nfile after dragging and dropping right\nCSV activity go to file\npath and create a\nfile create a file say want we name it\nas\nfile\nthree save the\nfile now that we have created defile\nwe'll write from the data table that is\nwe need to copy the merge data table so\nwe'll\nenter now that we we have finished the\nprogram the file is created let's save\nand run\nit process execution has started and\nended so let's go to the\nfile so this is the file which we\ncreated let's open this\nfile and here you can\nsee both the Excel files have been\nmerged into a single Excel file\nlet's go to the next question how to\nsend a file over at\nmail so first create a sequence and\ncreate a file after you have created a\nfile drag and drop get password\nactivity then drag and drop SMTP mail\nmessage activity so basically these two\nactivities are used to send a file over\nmail then run the sequence so we'll jump\ninto the uip studio and see\nso this was the previous question which\nwe answered how to merge to Excel files\nso the same file we will send it over a\nmail so we need a get password\nactivity so we'll drag and drop a get\npassword\nactivity so if you go to the property\nsection enter the password to whichever\nmail you are sending this file enter the\npassword of that mail\n[Music]\nID after entering the password in the\nresult go and create a\nvariable so that password is stored in\nthat variable so name the variable say\nanything any random so I've named the\nvariable after after this you need a\nSMTP mail message\nactivity so drag and do send SMTP mail\nmessage in SMTP mail message under the\nproperty Spain under the host enter the\nport value or the port number which is\n587 sorry\nafter entering the port number go to the\nserver and enter it as\nsmtp.gmail.com\nokay now after entering the email\nID go to your email and enter your email\nID to which you want to send this\nfile don't forget to use double codes\notherwise it will show\nerror enter the password so we had show\nthe password in an variable say\nSSS so we'll write\nthat so after that enter the email ID\nhere under the two option\nand enter the\nsubject say it as demo since we are\nshowing a demo we'll enter the subject\nas demo this is the this subject and\nbody is the subject and body of the\nmale now let's attach the file which we\nhave created\ncopy the file\nlocation so we'll go to the\nfile and copy this file\nlocation after attaching the\nfile let's save and\nrun the process has started and the\nprocess has ended here you can see in\nthe\noutput the process has started and the\nprocess has ended let's go over the mail\nand check if we have\nreceived here we go we have received the\nfile let's open the file\nand here you go the same this is the\nsame file which had merged the data so\nthe file is been sent over the mail one\nthing you have to keep in mind when you\nuse the get password activity go to your\nGoogle account in the security\nsection go to L secure app access and\nturn it\non you have to turn it on to receive the\nfile over at\nmail explain the different states and\ntrans positions in re framework there\nare four key States in re\nframework the first state is initial\nState this is the point at which the\nprocedure begins it's an event where the\nprocess initializes the settings and\nruns application test to ensure that all\nof the prerequisites for the process\nstart are\nmet next we have get transaction State\nthis state retrieves the next\ntransaction object this can be a q item\nor a collection item transaction items\nare Q items by default but this can be\nmodified to meet your needs this is also\nwhen the developer can set the condition\nto exit the state when there are no\nitems to\nprocess process transaction State for\nthe transaction item obtained in\nprevious step it performs actions logic\nin various application if a transaction\nitem has been processed the process\nmoves on to the next transaction item\navailable\nend process State the procedure is\ncompleted and the applications open\nduring automations are closed in the end\nprocess\nState let's jump into the UI path studio\nand see the different transitions in\nrobotic Enterprise\nframework so this is the robotic\nEnterprise framework this is the\ninitialization State the first state so\nit has two transitions System error that\nis system exception and successful when\nit shows system exception when a system\nerror is not nothing it gets transition\nto the end process suppose if you have\nan application exception during the\ninitialization phase and we don't have\nenough details to start a process then\nas a result we are going to end process\nstate to wrap it\nup and the successful is when a system\nerror is nothing it gets transition to\nget transaction state if during\ninitialization we have no error then it\ngoes to the get transaction\ndata the get transaction data has two\ntransitions no data and new transaction\nno data is when if the transaction item\nis nothing then we are at the end of our\ndata collection so it goes to the end\nprocess and in new transaction if the\ntransaction item contains data then it\nprocesses\nit the process transaction data has\nthree transitions success business\nexception and system exception success\nis when if the condition is business\nrule exception is nothing and system\nerror is nothing then the transition to\nget transaction data if there is a\nbusiness rule exception it is logged and\nwe move on to the next\ntransaction and Rule exception is if the\nbusiness rule exception is not nothing\nthen it gets transaction to the get\ntransaction data and the end process\ndoes not have any transitions since the\nend process is the final state so there\nare no\ntransitions what is a git activity the\nuip path git activity package helps in\nthe automation of Google workspace\napplications such as Google Calendar\nGoogle Drive Google Sheets Gmail Google\nDocs you can create and modify Google\ncalendar events manage Google drive\nfiles read and send Gmail messages and\ncreate new Google Sheets spreadsheets\nand Google Documents with the Google gut\nactivity\npackage what are selectus and wild cards\nin uip\npath wild cards are the symbols that\nenable you to replace zero or multiple\ncharacters in a string this can be quite\nuseful when dealing with dynamically\nchanging attributes in a\nselector selectors uip Studio uses what\nwe call selectors this store the\nattributes of graphical user interface\nelement and its parents in the shape of\nan XML fragment the selector adds in the\nautomatic generation of the selection by\nutilizing wild\ncards what is a machine explain standard\nmachine and machine\ntemplate the machine page allows you to\nprovision and manages machines to use\nthem to register robots with\norchestrator it displays the types of\nmachine that we currently in use it\nenables you to design your machine with\nstandard or template\nstandard machine it should be used when\nthe name of the machine on which you\nwant to Define robots is the same every\ntime you connect to it you define the\nmachine once and then you can connect to\nas many robots as you want from the\nrobots page machine template it should\nbe used whenever the name of the machine\non which you want to Define robot\nchanges you represent this entity once\nand then you use a unique active\ndirectory username to connect to any\nnumber of attended floating\nrobots explain delay do if and switch\nactivities in UI path the delay activity\nallows you to pause the automation for a\nspecified amount of time this activity\nis beneficial in projects that require\nprecise timing such as waiting for a\nspecific application to start or for\nsome information to be processed before\nusing it in the another activity\nthe do activity allows you to run a\nspecific piece of automation while a\ncondition is met the project exits the\nloop when the specified condition is no\nlonger completed this activity can be\nused to iterate through all the array\nelements or execute a specific action\nmultiple\ntimes if activity the if activity\nincludes a statement as well as two\nconditions if the statement is true the\nfirst condition is executed\nif the statement is fall the second\ncondition is executed if activities can\nbe used to make decision based on\nvariable\nvalues switch activity the switch\nactivity allows you to choose one of the\nseveral options based on the value of\nspecified expression the switch activity\nuses an integer argument by default but\nyou can change it in the properties\npanel under the type argument list the\nswitch activity can be used to\ncategorize data based on predefined\nnumber of\ncases how to create chart in\nExcel step one create a new sequence go\nto the uip part studio and create a new\nsequence and then drag and drop the\nfollowing activities to create a chart\nwe need to use Excel application scope\ncreate table activity and bar chart and\npie chart activity depending on which\ntype of charts you want to create\nthen at last after completing then run\nthe\nsequence we will see a demo of this in\nthe uip\nstudio how to upload a file on drive so\ncreate a new sequence and drag and drop\na git application then inside G\napplication drag and drop upload file\nactivity fill in the details and finally\nrun the suite let's go and see a demo to\nhow to create charts in Excel file and\nhow to upload a file on this\ndrive so let's jump into the uip part\nStudio this is the Excel file which I\nhave created it has all the number of\ncases in these five states in the year\n2021 the month of Jan Feb March and\nApril all this record I have taken it\nfrom a website called PRS india.org\nso I have two sheets sheet one and Sheet\ntwo so let's jump into the uip part\nStudio\nto start off with the demo we need to\nhave the three packages installed one is\nthe uip path Excel activities package\nthe other one is uip su. activities this\nactivity this package is used for drive\nto upload on the drive\nthen the other package is balara Excel\nactivities this package is used for bar\ngraph and pie\nchart so after installing this three\npackages we'll get\nstarted so let's create a new\nsequence name it as\nsequence\n2 so first we'll drag and drop an Excel\napplication\nscope so Excel application scope what it\ndoes is it opens an Excel workbook and\nsets the scope for Excel activities when\nthis activity is completed the specified\nworkbook and the Excel application are\nclosed when the workbook application\nvariable is specified in the output\nworkbook activi is field the spreadsheet\nis not\nclosed after this drag and drop uh\ncreate table\nactivity so by default we have sheet one\nand enter the range so the range is in\nthis Excel sheet the range is from A1 to\nF5 so enter the\nrange for this we need to enter the file\npath so we'll select the\nfile so we have selected the file we\nhave entered\nthe enter the table name\nsay number of\ncases so once this much is done next\nwe'll drag and drop a bar\nchart drop it outside the Excel\napplication scope and select the file\npath so select\nfile so select the file select this cell\nrange that is the same range what we had\nentered\nearlier A1 to\nF5 so once that is done give the chart\ntitle say\nthises and you can select the chart type\nbar stack 3D clustered 3D stack whatever\nis it required for now we'll select bar\ncluster we have many other options to\nexplore data label\ntype we'll keep it\nin show value so that it shows the\nvalue and select show\nvalue you want show percentage you can\nselect\npercentage we'll select show Legend and\nsize you can vary the size accordingly\nhow much you want so I'll keep the size\nas\n350 to\n350 you can change the\nwidth so the bar chart is done and you\ncan enter the sheet which sheet are you\nusing so it's sheet\none we and drop pie\nchart select the\nfile similarly enter the options here\nenter the cell range the same\nrange A1 is to\nF5 show percent we will show value\nshow\nLegend select show\nvalue and select the sheet which you\nwant we'll select the sheet two\nso done so we have completed till here\nnext we need to upload this on the\nGoogle Drive so we select this option\nupload\nfile select the\nfile so we have selected defile so\nselect the destination\nfolder for that go to your Google Drive\naccount\nso we'll go\nthere so in my drive I have created a\nfolder called Excel automation so I'll\ncopy this\nURL till here not the entire copy\nthis and go to your UI PCH studio and\npaste it in the destination folder\ndouble\nquotes then create a variable\nand create a variable as\nfive oops there is an\nerror oh we have forgotten to use a git\napplication this can be only used inside\na git application so drag and drop a git\napplication and inside G\napplication we'll write this so the\nerror is\ngone so we'll run the file\nnow we'll save\nit and\nrun you can see the find is getting\nrun so the execution is ended we will\nnavigate to the\ndrive so here you can see the file is\nsuccessfully uploaded we'll open the\nfile it's working on the graph\nhere you go here you can see the bar\ngraph for the sheet one with the values\nnumber of values and each state wise and\nfor Sheet two we created a pie chart so\nhere you go here you can see the pie\nchart so with that we have come to the\nend of the RPA uip paath full course\ntutorial if you enjoyed watching it make\nsure to hit the Subscribe button and\npress the Bell icon to never miss an\nupdate thank you so much
