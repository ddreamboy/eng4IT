  "text": "hi everyone\nthis is going to be a very short and\nfocused video on four types of cloud\ndeployment model\nalong with some of their variants\nlet's start with discussing the basic\nand the most famous cloud deployment\nmodel which is public cloud\nplease note that\nthe diagram used here is a repeat of\nwhat was shown in the previous video of\nthis very series which was titled\nintroduction to cloud computing\nthe intent of that video was to\nintroduce cloud computing to you\nwith the help of\nhow a public cloud looks like\nhere i have explained it in terms of\ndeployment model\nso\nin this model the infrastructure is\nhosted at cloud service providers\nphysical boundaries and can be made\navailable to or basically can be shared\nby\nmultiple individuals and organizations\nand hence promotes multi-tenancy\nservers here are shared\nthis model is more cost effective one\nthis was a very initial model that was\nused and\nit hugely became popular\nbut for large organizations who had\ncertain data security\ndata privacy jurisdiction and other\nregulatory requirements it still didn't\nsolve their problems\nnow\nlet's move on to discussing private\ncloud which solve this problem for large\norganizations\nprivate cloud is one where an\ninfrastructure is operated exclusively\nfor an organization and is not shared\nwith any other organization\nthere can be variance to this\nfirst variant is\nwhen the servers or machines or\ninfrastructure is hosted within the\nphysical boundaries of an organization\nfor which the cloud is being set up\nthis is typically the organization's\ndata center\nhere a particular data center or a part\nof a data center that organization owns\ncan be dedicated for cloud\nthis variant is popularly known as\non-premise or simply on-prem\nthe next variant to this is where the\ninfrastructure which is to be\nexclusively hosted and operated for an\norganization is hosted on cloud service\nproviders physical boundaries\nthis is known as off-premise\nonly one organization will have access\nto this even though it is on\nnot on their data center\nand finally in terms of who operates\nboth these type of setups it can be the\norganization or the cloud service\nprovider\nwhich could be another two variants\nprivate cloud did solve the problem of\ndata security and compliance but it\ndidn't fully utilize the benefits that\nthat cloud provides\nhence came hybrid cloud which is now the\nmost popular one amongst large\norganization and is also the way forward\nsimply put a hybrid cloud is a\ncombination of at least one public cloud\nand at least one private cloud\nhere\nprivate cloud can be on-premise or\noff-premise\nwhat's shown in the diagram is a hybrid\ncloud that uses a combination of an\non-premise private cloud\nand a public cloud\nso how best can this model work for\nlarge organizations\nwell\nthe best way is to use on-premise\nprivate cloud to keep applications and\ndata that is core to the business of the\norganization and which has specific\nregulatory requirements\non the other hand\napplications that are not closer to core\nbusiness and are genetic in nature are\ngood candidates for being hosted at\npublic cloud\nnext and final type of deployment model\nis community cloud\nthis is a relatively newer\nand an interesting model\nhere\norganizations with common requirements\nand interests share a cloud\ninfrastructure\nin terms of hosting and managing this\ncloud there could be various\ncombinations it can be hosted or managed\nby one organization combination of\norganizations or by cloud service\nprovider itself\nconsidering the requirements and use\ncases\nan example of where this type of model\ncan work\nand this is just a thought\nis kyc\nkyc is performed by banks during\nonboarding of a customer as well as\nperiodically\nthere is a lot of duplicated efforts and\ncosts that take place during this\nprocess\na community cloud can be ideal place in\nfuture to share such information across\nbanks\nanother example is various government\nagencies and bodies\nusing this type of model to share data\nfor better governance\nin terms of costs this model sits\nsomewhere between a public cloud and a\nprivate cloud setup\nso that's all we have for today if you\nliked the video and had a good learning\nexperience then do check out our other\nvideos do like and share\nalso subscribe the channel for latest\nvideos and trends in the world of\narchitecture\nsee you in the next video\n",
