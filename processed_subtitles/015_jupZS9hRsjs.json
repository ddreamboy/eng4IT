  "text": "hey guys and welcome to new video in\nthis video here we're going to talk\nabout like how to get started with\ncomputer vision how do you actually get\ninto computer Vis Vision how did did I\nget into computer vision and how did I\nact like start this journey here with\nthe YouTube uh first of all i' I started\nout with computer vision I went more\ninto like deep learning now we're\nactually combining deep learning and\ncomputer vision we're going to talk\nabout that and then I'm going to give\nyou some some tips and some guidelines\nwe're going to set up a road map of like\nhow to actually like get into computer\nvision so basically like if you're\ninterested in computer vision the first\nstep is to learn like the fundamentals\nof computer science and also like\nprogramming I suggest you start off with\npython if you haven't programmed before\nlike definitely start out with python\nyou can learn the basics like the if\nstatements for loops and all those\naround things and then after you are\nfamiliar with like the programming\nconcept you can actually like go in try\nto do some some different kind of things\nin C++ as well because then you will get\nknowledge on a lower level you also need\nsome understanding inside of like some\nmath understanding to act like do\ncomputer vision task of course you can\ncall some different kind of functions\nfrom Frameworks but it is always good to\nknow like how does it act like work\nunder the hood and you'll also be way\nbetter at solving problems and also like\nfinding solutions to problems if you\nhave like fundamental like knowledge in\nmath especially for linear algebra and\nalso calculus but linear algebra is\nactually really essential uh when we're\ndoing all these different kind of\ncalculations for computer vision and\nthen when you have a strong F foundation\nin these subjects you can start like\nlearning the basics stuff about computer\nvision uh image processing video\nprocessing which is basically just like\na a sequence of images then when you\nhave done that like the basic image\nprocessing I have tutorials about all of\nit here on the channel my tutorials is\nacts like in C++ so I'll definitely\nrecommend uh first start off with the\nbasic concepts in Python if you're\nfamiliar with programming and python you\ncan just directly go into uh my tutorial\nwith C++ I go over like all the basic\nthings so first of all we start with\nimage processing how can you faal an\nimage how can you blur an image uh how\nto actually like remove noise and images\nwe're talking about those different kind\nthings on a really low fundamental level\nso you'll get like the basic\nunderstanding the tutorials I have here\non the channel about computer vision is\nbasically going from like the beginner\nlevel to more intermediate level and\nthen at the end here we act like at a\npretty high level where we're combining\nall the different kind of things and we\nalso like put deep learning optic\ndetection and all those different kind\nthings on top of our um computer vision\nFoundation with the B basic things and\nalso the more intermediate things with\nlike for example like background\nsubtraction feature extraction how can\nwe actually like extract features and\nFrames match them to different kind of\nframes and then on a more advanced level\nhow can we do like 3D image processing\nuh depth estimation how can we calculate\ndepth with our images and all the\ndifferent kind of things with stereo\nVision so this is basically like the\nRope map so start by learning the\nfundamentals of computer science\nprogramming including like data\nstructures and algorithms but and the\nmost important things within math it Act\nis actually like algebra linear algebra\nand calculus you'll be able to use it\nfor a lot of different kind of like\ncomputer vision applications uh when\nwe're going to do some multiplication\nand all those different kind things when\nwe're going to actually like do\noperations on images we're basically\njust using linear algebra then after\nthat learn the basics of like image and\nvideo processing uh including like these\ndifferent kind of techniques for filling\ntransforming and acts like just\nanalyzing visual data we're doing a lot\nof different kind of like\nTransformations uh filtering methods and\nall those different kind of things I\nboth have like practical ways of how to\nact like do it but I also go over the\ntheory of how these algorithm filters\nand Transformations act like Works um on\nthe math level as well when you know all\nthose basic things you can actually like\njust take it into another step so those\nare the more like basic steps for\nactually like getting into computer\nvision now we can take it to an\nintermediate level where we actually go\ninside like feature extraction um\nprocessing identifying and extracting\ninformation from our images so basically\nwe're just giving some images and then\nwe actually like want to do something\nwith it we want to be able to use it in\nreal life because again like we're just\nlearning computer vision to actually\nlike get our computers to see something\nin the real world so then we can take it\nto the intermediate steps which is\nactually like feature extraction uh we\nwant to like do for example like it's\ndetection color histograms how can I\nlike get information from color\nhistograms how can we manipulate our\nimage\nuh so we can actually like see more\ninformation in our images without doing\nanything else than some post processing\nuh playing around with some histograms\nand so on and then again we can just add\nlike pattern recognition optic detection\nand all those different kind things\nwhich is basically like on a bit more\nhigh level so when we have the basics\nbasic operations of computer vision we\nhave the basics then we go to the media\nstep extract features and all those\ndifferent kind things and then the next\nlevel is basically just combining the\nintermediate steps and basic steps we go\nup on an even higher level we combine\nall those different things we do feature\nextracting to try to like find 3D\ninformation in our images we do stereo\nrevision um Optical flow optic detection\nand then when we actually get to that\nstage we can try to like get into deep\nlearning how can we combine deep\nlearning with computer vision because\nacts like you can just take your images\nThro and through some um deep learning\nmodels you can then do optic detection\noptic segmentation and all those\ndifferent kind of things but the more\nadvanced computer vision stuff is\nactually like 3D reconstruction\nunderstanding understanding just seeing\nyou're in and understanding what you\nactually see in the images and then also\nvisual tracking so again you can both\nlike do detection in your images so\nlet's say we want to do like a person\ndetector then we can actually like just\ndetect that person walking around in the\nimage frame but sometimes you might lose\ntrack and we actually like need to\nactually like track the exact objects\nmoving in the frame then we can also add\nanother step then we're adding tracking\non top of our detections and now we\nactually get to a really advanced level\nand when we're at that level within\ncomputer vision and deep learning we can\nactually like start to make some really\nuseful things for the real world and\nthen when you're at that point you're\nreally really good at computer vision\nyou can do a lot of different kind of\nthings you can actually like work with\ndifferent like projects Concepts you can\ndo like pretty much everything within\ncomputer vision of course new things\ncome out all the time you need to keep\nkeep updated with that again as you\ncontinue to learn and improve your\nskills within computer vision also like\nparticipate in different kind of like\nonline communities also here in the\nchannel be active on the channel in\ndifferent communities learn from other\npeople like talk to other people also if\nyou teach other people the concepts and\nthe ideas that you learn by yourself\nthen you will act like understand them\nway better this was also act like one of\nthe main reasons I started this YouTube\nchannel was to actually like teach you\nguys something about like computer\nvision deep learning on all those\ndifferent kind things and just as the\ntime went by I just get got way better\nat computer vision all these different\nkind things by just like talking about\nthem teaching them to you guys I just\ngained a lot of more knowledge um I was\nactually like getting more into like\nimplementing these things actually like\ngoing from like fairy to act like\nimplementations how can we use this in\nthe real world and then I just kept on\nimproving like my my computer vision\nskills and and my understanding of\ncomputer vision and how it works it just\ngot way better by act like teaching\ntalking with other guys about it um\ntrying it out again if you want to be\ngood at something you just need to put\nin the hours so my advice is basically\njust like particip at like talk to other\nguys participate in different kind of\nlike communities in forums stay up to\ndat like uh get into like Twitter like\nLinkedIn and all those different kind of\nthings just stay up to date with the new\nthings in computer vision once you have\nlike the basic understanding on the\nfundamental levels or you're at the\nreally high level uh you try to like do\nsomething useful with computer vision\nyou can also look at different kind of\nlike conferences as all and all those\ndifferent kind things but the most\nimportant thing is to actually like just\nstay up to date keep learning and the\nway you learn is act like by\nimplementing things so again if you just\nlike look at it at a fundamental and\nlike thetical uh view you won't really\nbe able to apply it Implement those\ndifferent kind things in real world\ncomputer vision applications because you\ncan of course call some functions from\nomv and all those different kind of\nthings on images but once you are given\na project in the real world you have a\ncamera in a production setup for example\nthen it will just be way way harder if\nyou haven't done it before so my advice\nis basically just Implement do some\npractical stuff the more practical thing\nto do the better you will be and also if\nyou talk with other guys like discuss\nthe different kind of things uh try to\ncreate some project with uh with other\npeople as well discuss in different kind\nof like communities or firms your\nunderstanding of computer vision will\njust be way way better so keep learning\nand keep improving your skills I have\nall these videos here covered like from\nthe basic intermediate steps to a more\nlike high level step where we're going\ninto like freeding information stereo\nVision op diation deep learning and all\nthose different around things because\nlike computer vision is a rapidly\ninvolving field so it's important to\nstay engage continue to learn never stop\nkeep on learning keep on implementing\nthese things here in practical ways you\nwill get way way better and it will pay\noff in the end thank you guys for\nwatching this video here and again\nremember to hit the Subscribe button and\nBell notification on the video also like\nthis video here if you like the content\nand you want more in the future again as\nI've mentioned throughout this video I\nhave videos about everything with\ncomputer vision from the basic levels of\nimage processing to more like Advanced\nthings where we do feature extracting\nmatch the features do reconstruction\nlike freed reconstruction stereo Vision\nlike Point clouds applying deep learning\nto computer vision and all those\ndifferent kind things if you're\ninterested in it I'll link to one of the\ntutorials up here or else on see next\nfor you guys bye for now\n",
