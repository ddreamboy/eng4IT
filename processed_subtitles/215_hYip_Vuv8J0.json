  "text": "my name is bettina warburg i'm a\nresearcher of transformative\ntechnologies and co-founder of animal\nventures today i've been challenged to\nexplain one concept at five levels of\nincreasing complexity\nmy topic is blockchain technology\nblockchain is a new network and it's\ngoing to help us decentralize trade\nallowing us to do a lot of our\ntransactions much more peer-to-peer\ndirectly and lower our use of\nintermediaries like companies or banks\nmay be i think today everyone can leave\nunderstanding something about blockchain\nat some level\ndo you know what we're going to talk\nabout today\nit's called blockchain what's blockchain\nthat's a really good question it's\nactually a way that we can trade\ndo you know what trade is\nit's like it's when you take turns every\ntime that's when you give a most of what\nyou want right when you give up most of\nwhat you want well sometimes that\ndefinitely happens for sure what if i\ntold you that there's a kind of\ntechnology that i work on that means you\ncould trade with any kid all over the\nworld really yeah if i could trade with\nany kid i would trade\nwell i would chase something i don't\nlike so much that's probably a good idea\nmaybe somebody else likes it more than\nyou do so normally when people trade\nthey have to go to the store or they\nhave to know the person so that they can\nget what they asked for with blockchain\nyou can make that exact same trade but\nyou don't need the store and you don't\neven necessarily need to know the other\nperson\nreally really\nso ian do you know what blockchain is no\nhave you ever traded or sold anything\nactually i'm selling my computer on ebay\nright now that's amazing what made you\ndecide to trade on ebay um well i mean\ni've heard of it and i trust it a lot\nbecause there's they have like all their\nguarantees so i i know that i'm gonna\nget money and the person's gonna get\nwhat they want so what if i told you\nthat blockchain technology is basically\na tool where you can do the exact same\nthing but it goes to you and i directly\nyou wouldn't need an ebay or a brand in\nbetween that's cool and there's a lot of\nthose kinds of middlemen\nin our society today right we have a lot\nof banks we have a lot of\ncompanies that sort of\nhelp us make sure that our trades happen\nbut if we could guarantee the same trade\nusing technology\nas sort of like a technological trust\nthen we wouldn't really need all those\nmiddlemen in between so how does it work\nit's basically a network of computers\nthat all have the same history\nof transactions and so instead of sort\nof there being one company with one\ndatabase that holds all the information\nthe same sort of list\nis held by all these different people\nlike you could have it on your computer\nand then it gets validated by everyone\nand basically that turns into the next\npart of the list so it's sort of\nconstantly updating itself so like how\ndo you make sure that it's secure so it\nuses cryptography and that helps it\nbasically encode all of the transactions\nso you can't really see exactly what\nhappened but you know it happened\nbecause it's like a marker so you could\nkind of like i don't know say trade you\ntrade apples but you would just see like\nrandom letters yeah for it so you\nwouldn't be able to like track it i\nguess exactly that's cool so it's kind\nof this like really big ledger or\naccounting system for all sorts of\nthings that get traded but instead of\nbeing owned by one company\nit's owned by everybody that's cool yeah\nwe're going to talk about blockchain\ntechnology have you heard of blockchain\ni've heard of the words blockchain but\ni'm not sure i know what it is so when\nwe were much smaller societies you and i\ncould trade in our community pretty\neasily but as the distance in our trade\ngrew we ended up inventing institutions\nright if you use uber or you use\nairbnb or you use amazon even these are\njust digital marketplaces and platforms\nthat help us facilitate an exchange of\nvalue\nbut today we actually have a technology\nthat allows us to trade one-to-one but\nat scale and it's called blockchain\ntechnology there is some kind of\ninterface for it you could have an app\nor you could use your computer to do it\nbut instead of there being a company in\nthe middle or what's helping you make\nthat transaction is a bunch of software\ncode and so it's being run by all of\nthese different computers\nthat have like a node so they're all\nrunning the same software and\nguaranteeing your transactions\num as they happen i mean i would assume\nthis technology is taking away business\nor activity from these middlemen in some\ncases yeah it is and a lot of people in\nthe financial industry in particular are\nlooking at it from the banking side of\nhow do we use\nthis technology to trade things like\nbitcoin or other tokens that um\nare easier to use instead of today's\ncurrency you know a lot of people think\nabout blockchain as bitcoin\nbecause it's sort of in the news a lot\nand it's this new cryptocurrency and\nit's kind of exciting but we're actually\nseeing a lot more use cases for\nblockchain that aren't around the\ncurrency side they're more around how do\nyou take any asset\nand be able to trade that using the same\ntechnology is there a mechanism for\nverifying\nthat person a is a legitimate\nseller or producer of the item\nso today a lot of people are working on\nhow to create identity structures that\nleverage blockchain and one of the tools\nfor doing that is being able to\ncryptographically sign\nfor\na given attribute so your\ngovernment could sign that you have a\nu.s passport or a university could sign\nthat you are a currently enrolled\nstudent and you could then dole out that\ninformation\nand control it yourself and be able to\nshow people those certifications on an\nas needed basis\nso today we're going to talk about\nblockchain technology okay have you ever\nheard of blockchain i have whenever we\nhave a transaction and let's say i buy\nsomething from you this information gets\nlogged and it gets verified by a third\nperson or third party and then\nif like all this information verified\nand it all matches right the transaction\ngoes through without any intermediary\nbasically right and it gets stored\nand when we make further transactions\nthis information is already embedded\nit's in the in the ledger yeah that's\nexactly right and you can append it you\ncan sort of add new information that's\nmore current but you can't actually go\nerase anything absolutely right the way\nthe technology is changing nothing's\ngonna be like it used to be and there's\nno like firm and then the buyer and the\nseller and it's basically we'll have to\nrewrite a lot of rules and economics as\nwell for sure a lot of the assumptions\nwon't hold true same with who are the\nwho are the actors it's not just people\nanymore it's machines absolutely we're\ngoing to have to create entire new\nconcepts of how they do trade and how\nthey work with us too what kind of\nbarriers or roadblocks would you\nimagine\nare going to happen in the blockchain\nspace so at least when we we talk about\nbitcoin there are some trust issues\nthere have been some hacks and uh\nso there is obviously a need to to work\non on trust and feeling that it's uh\nit's the safe technology yeah one of the\nproblems that bitcoin has faced is\nbitcoins getting stolen or lost but a\nlot of that actually comes from\npeople trying to recentralize bitcoin in\ndifferent ways making themselves\nactually a pretty easy target absolutely\nso education will be a big part before\nwe actually can use the technology very\nin in the wide sense right yeah to\nactually transition into the mainstream\nand and make it useful for average\npeople to use we're going to need to\nmake sure we have\na lot more education a lot more\nstandards and probably work with a lot\nof enterprises to create sort of the\nuser experience around this being a\ntechnology that is safe and usable and\nunderstandable what is the current state\nof blockchain in your understanding\nwhat's going to have to happen next the\ncurrent state is in this the research\nstate and it's being\ndeveloped to to be applied in many many\nareas it might be used almost everywhere\nto where like we won't even imagine how\nwe lived without it but i'm not sure\nwhere it's going to go i mean no one\nreally knows right well we have a lot of\nuh public blockchains\nlike we have bitcoin we have the\nethereum network\nnxt but a lot of companies and\nconsortiums are getting together to\nbuild\nprivate blockchains so ones that are\nmore closed off at first and then may\nevolve into a public network when people\nfeel comfortable using it and some are\nalso proof of concepts out in the real\nworld projects in energy and in\npharmaceuticals and in\nretail and lots of different fields are\nstarting experiments and we'll see in\nthe next few years how all of those\ninteract and what we learn about the\nbest use cases for blockchain and what\nit means for trade\nso tell me your version of a technical\ndefinition of blockchain\na technical definition of blockchain is\nthat it is\na persistent transparent public\nappend-only ledger\nso it is a system that you can add data\nto and not change previous data within\nit\nit does this through a mechanism for\ncreating consensus\nbetween scattered or distributed parties\nthat do not need to trust each other but\njust need to trust the mechanism by\nwhich their consensus has arrived at\nin the case of blockchain\nit relies on some form of challenge\nsuch that\nno one actor on the network is able to\nsolve this challenge consistently more\nthan everyone else on the network so it\nrandomizes yes yeah it randomizes the\nprocess and in theory ensures that no\none can force the blockchain to accept a\nparticular entry onto the ledger that\nothers disagree with one that\nrelies on a mechanism for a peer-to-peer\nnetwork that can maintain\nupdates to the ledger and then verify\nthose updates in such a way that it is\nimpossible to defraud and impossible to\nalter after the fact and do you see it\nas defining a new discipline of kinds or\nwhere where are we going to see\nblockchain emerge in the real world\nfirst i mean just so like as an example\none thing that i think about a lot in\nterms of possible blockchain\napplications is electricity right the\nnext generation of distributed smart\ngrid technology effectively sure and\npeople are working on that already yeah\nyeah exactly and it's this very fruitful\narea of research and you can find\nyourself looking like 20 years out right\nwhere you have an enormous number like\nof electric cars you have all of these\nbatteries like that's essentially\num a distributed\npeak load power grid right like the cars\nare getting plugged in and unplugged at\ndifferent times if you have a mechanism\nthat is able to\nautomatically and autonomously\nbe distributing power based on batteries\nthat are scattered throughout the grid\nthat are being used for other purposes\ntheir owners don't even necessarily need\nto be aware you begin to have something\nthat looks like a much more viable\nsociety that still has a lot of\nelectricity needs but is able to base\nthat much more on renewables is able to\nmake up the difference during peak load\nperiods or during differences in weather\nthat is able to have power much closer\nto where it's needed rather than having\nto be distributed over great distances\nlike\nthat's something that would be an\nenormously hard problem to solve and\nit's not that the blockchain makes it\neasy but it makes it possible a lot of\npeople are seeing blockchain in the news\nand maybe seeing a lot of sort of\ninitial coin offerings this sort of\nmonetization opportunity around\nblockchain and are getting very excited\nabout it and some of that excitement is\nis real and should be you know\nencouraged but some of it is also hype\nhow do you feel about the hype cycle\naround blockchain today i'm glad you\nmentioned initial coin offerings um\nbecause for me those really exemplify\nthe sort of the the problem that we're\nhaving at this exact moment they are a\nan idea with enormous potential\nsignificance down the road however the\npromise of the initial coin offering has\nbeen kind of hijacked into this string\nof like basically pump and dump scams or\nsort of desperate gold rush schemes the\nfaster that we can we can shift from\nthis this fantasy that it is going to\nmake you rich in a sort of you know\n1920s tulip bubble kind of way um\nis is that is the sooner that we can get\ninto people honestly and i mean this\nlike with all the hope in the world\npeople being disappointed in blockchains\nlike oh i didn't get rich it's just\nbeing used now to make it easier to\ntransact goods and services safely\nacross borders this isn't exciting at\nall and then we'll see that like become\npart of the everyday infrastructure of\nthe world in a way that i think will be\nvery significant but i think it is now\nalmost every aspect of it that's\nconnected with the concept of money is\nwildly overhyped um and\nit also creates a problem which is\npeople get a lot of excitement around it\nand then they're waiting for\n[Music]\nthe world to change yeah right where\nwhere is this technology why haven't i\nseen anything changing yes yes because\nwe've had a lot of pr a lot of proof of\nconcept but yeah truthfully this is more\nlike a science right it will develop it\nwill take five years it will take 10\nyears that kind of time is necessary one\nof the areas that brought me to supply\nchain research is the fact that we're\nwe're not just going to see blockchain\nemerge we're going to see artificial\nintelligence continue to evolve we're\ngonna see connected devices and this\nsort of growing internet of things\nmachinery that can do a lot more and\nhave a wallet and transact on their own\nand so\ni actually think a lot of where\nblockchain and other technologies are\nheaded is this interesting synergy that\nwill help us elevate the kinds of\ninstitutions we've used in the past and\ncobbled together to create that\nidentifiable\nverifiable trust yes and one of the most\ninteresting ideas to me that came out of\nthe currency side of the blockchain\nproject was the notion around like\ncoloring coins right assign properties\nto a particular coin\nand in particular to assign those\nproperties in ways that would allow you\nto do things like bring in the graph of\nprevious transactions you know there's\nsort of an obvious application for this\nwhich is something that would look a\nlittle bit like an extreme version of\nlike a boycott divestment and sanctions\nkind of approach right a model where\nit's sort of like i will not touch money\nmy wallet will automatically not touch\nmoney that has been exchanged with the\nfollowing as a sort of very extreme way\nof cutting those things out but there's\nalso ways in which i think that could be\napplied to to clearing out the entire\nlogistics process of many kinds of bad\nactors but trying to make a supply chain\nbetter in some ways relies a lot on\nwhose version of better that is and\nexactly kind of what gets qualified but\nalso how that is quantified\nwithin say some kind of like smart\ncontract system there's multiple ways\nthat i could see this backfiring and one\nis the ways in which that is implemented\nfor example\nleaving certain kinds of bad behavior\nuntouched or unanalyzed or one that\nfeels even more dire to me in some ways\nis creating an extremely inflexible con\nlike because human contracts legal\ncontracts are actually very flexible\nlike there's a lot of kind of room to\nmove and renegotiate yeah but we we\nalready have\nreal world versions of some of these\nnightmare scenarios right where like\nyour kid has a medical emergency and you\ncan't unlock your car because you're two\ndays behind on payments for it and so\nthe car system will no longer respond to\nthe app mechanism that you're supposed\nto be able to use to drive it barrier\nbeing sort of a rigidity in structures\nthat maybe don't accommodate real life\nscenarios very well as you and i have\nbeen talking one of the things that\nkeeps coming up is that we tend to hold\nnovel technologies to an unrealistically\nhigh standard in terms of what they are\nsupposed to deliver rather than\ncomparing them to actually existing\nsystems where we can begin to see the\npossibility that even like a slight\nincremental improvement would still be\nan enormous gain the system we have\ntoday is also broken\nright\nit's it's hard to compare it to some\nperfect future just like we compare\num you know autonomous vehicles to this\nvery high standard because machines are\ndoing it should be perfect right there\nshould be zero car deaths\nand when you say well there's hundreds\nof thousands millions of you know car\ndeaths on the road due to human error\ntoday i think we're in a similar place\nwe're going to see problems with this\ntechnology and we are going to need to\ndevelop\nmultiple kinds of standards that also\nhave some flexibility\nbut it's it's going to also be a\nversion a system that\nallows us to fix some of the things that\nare broken today\nblockchain may sound complicated but at\nits core it's just another tool for\nhumans and eventually robots and other\nkinds of identities to trade at scale\nand make that trade more decentralized\nand it's part of our future so it's\nimportant that people have these kinds\nof conversations and start to learn\nabout it\n",
