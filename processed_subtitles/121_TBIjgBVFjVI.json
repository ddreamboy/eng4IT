  "text": "the worst part about being a front-end\ndeveloper is developing uis which also\nhappens to be 100% of the job web\ndevelopers have tried to make things\neasier with countless UI libraries like\nbootstrap material and so on but\nrecently Shad Cen the hottest UI\nframework in the front-end World\nrecently released a major update that\nmakes it way overpowered and it's\nnothing like you've ever seen before the\nonly way I can think to describe it is\nlike if Ruby on Rails and Skynet had a\nbaby who grew up and got jacked on\nsteroids and then got into front-end web\ndevelopment when I started this channel\nback in 2017 my goal was to make\ntutorials like this Facebook style Emoji\nreaction thing the code for that video\ntook the better part of a day but now I\ncan build an even better one in like 30\nseconds in today's video you'll learn\nhow to build a custom front-end website\nfaster than ever but with great power\ncomes great trade-offs and we'll also\nlook at the drawbacks of this approach\nit is September 5th 2024 and you're\nwatching the code report last week I ran\na pull about for sale and thousands of\npeople agree that it's the best for an\nincloud this video is not sponsored by\nthem nor have they sponsored any of my\npast videos and that's why I can tell\nyou that yesterday versell took a pretty\nbig L when it was revealed that chat GPT\nswitch from nextjs to remix despite that\nversell did make a really good move by\nhiring the developer behind Shad CN and\nnow as we'll see it's tightly integrated\ninto the versel ecosystem the Shaden is\na component or UI library but it's a lot\ndifferent than most other libraries like\nbootstrap instead of installing a\nmassive library of components into your\nnode modules and importing them you copy\nand paste the code for each individual\ncomponent into your own project which\nallows you to use things all a cart and\nmakes it easier to customize the code it\nsounds chaotic but it's based on\nPrimitives like radex and Tailwind which\nkeep things looking consistent pretty\ncool but it's killer new feature landed\nin the CLI in the form of a component\nregistry like you can run Shad Cen ad\ndata table or Shaden ad Carousel to\neasily add those components to your\nproject and it works with all the major\nFrameworks but here's where things get\nreally crazy versell also runs this\nservice called vzer which is an AI chat\nbot for building UI like all you do is\nask for a button and it'll return\nsomething that looks just as good as any\na16z funded startup with a $100 million\nvaluation if we look at the code though\nwhat you'll notice it's doing is relying\non the existing Shad CN button it then\nAI generates some extra Tailwind slot\nand the end result is pretty nice that's\nnot the crazy part though if we click on\nthis install button up here we'll have a\ncommand to Shad CN add this to our\nproject it'll automatically copy that\ncode into our project and bring in any\nnecessary dependencies and now we have a\ncool custom button we can use anywhere\nand not just that but these URL can also\nbe made public to be shared with anyone\nand you could even build up your own\nstandard library of Shad Cen components\nif you drink the Shaden Kool-Aid and\nthen combine it with other AI tools like\nco-pilot or cursor you can build uis 10\ntimes faster than you could just a few\nmonths ago and they actually look\nhalfway decent the end result might look\nexactly the same as all your friend side\nprojects but at least it didn't take you\n6 months to build but the AI haters out\nthere will tell you to never touch any\nof these tools they'll make your\nprogramming skills go flaccid and their\ngarbage code will eventually backfire on\nyou the but the reality is that just a\nfew years ago you'd have to solve many\nof these problems by going dumpster\ndiving for code on blogs or humiliate\nyourself with a stack Overflow question\nbut nowadays you have people building\nto-do apps in their Teslas in the Ikea\nparking lot the AI performance gains are\nreal but they have to be used carefully\nand deliberately to avoid unnecessary\ncomplexity I don't think Tech like this\nwill replace actual front-end developers\nbut here's my prediction in the near\nfuture I think developers will care less\nabout the ergonomics of a framework like\nthe syntax differences between angular\nreact View and spell and care about how\nquickly and reliably they can generate\nstuff like I wouldn't be surprised if we\nsee a prompt-based UI framework oh wait\na minute it actually looks like someone\nalready built that this has been the\ncode report thanks for watching and I\nwill see you in the next one\n",
