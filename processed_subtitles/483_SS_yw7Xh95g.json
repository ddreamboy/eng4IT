  "text": "you want to break into cyber security\nbut have no idea where to start I've\nbeen working in cyber security for the\npast year and a few months now and I've\ngone through those steps of learning and\nbreaking into this industry and I can\nshare some really good steps that could\nhelp you do exactly the same if you're\nworried and don't know where to start in\ngetting into this industry in this video\nI'm going to provide some clear and\nsimple steps for you to start your\njourney in breaking into cyber please\nenjoy this\nvideo\nmy name is Caleb only certified I love\nto make videos on the tech industry and\nif you take any value from this video\nplease like this video to make sure that\nit goes out there to as many people as\npossible that need this video so yes so\nI've been working in cyber security for\nover a year now and I will be providing\nyou with some steps to start your\njourney in this industry but before we\nget into it there's one thing that I've\nthought about that I kind of want to\nmention it's important to note that\nthere is cyber security in so many roles\nit is a common Concept in companies and\nin the workplace that cyber security is\nnot the job of one person it's not the\njob of an engineer a cybercity engineer\nit is the job of everyone at the company\nand this could mean simple things like\ncuz you're not a cyber SEC engineer\ndoesn't mean that you don't protect your\ndata or it doesn't mean that you don't\nprotect your password or privileged\ninformation and so because of this there\nare loads of roles outside of being a\ncyber security engineer or analyst that\nhave the concepts of cyber security\ninvolved in them like even as an it\nsupport engineer there's many aspects of\ncyber security involved in your role and\neven as an infrastructure engineer\nthere's loads of those concepts of cyber\ninvolved in your role as well and there\nare so many other examples of that and\nthat is an important thing to know when\nyou're getting into this industry and\nyou'll find out why I mention that later\nin this video but let's get into the\nsteps Step One Is to learn the\nfundamentals the it fundamental\nnetworking Hardware software operating\nsystems the basic concepts of it before\nyou're able to become a cyber security\nengineer these are things you need to\nknow and understand pretty well and you\nmight be thinking how do I go about this\nhow do I get my fundamental\nunderstanding of it and know these basic\nconcepts and have a great understanding\nof networking and hardware and all these\nthings well there are definitely many\nways of doing this but I can only say\nthe way that I did this I did this\nthrough the compta A+ and I'm sure\nyou've heard of this certification\nbefore compta plus is an amazing\nfundamental certification\nthat will give you a good understanding\nof all these Concepts whether it's\nnetworking or Hardware or software or or\ntroubleshooting and many other things\nnow if you're thinking about taking the\ncomp A+ to get your foundations in order\nthere's one thing that I will mention\nnow when I took the compt A+ I didn't\njust take this exam and study for it and\npass it with just knowing the knowledge\nand information I also went about\npracticing this information to make sure\nI really grasp the knowledge that I was\nlearning for example right here I have a\nsystem\nunit and if you're taking the compt A+\nand learning a lot about Hardware a\nreally good thing to do would be to take\nthis apart grab yourself a screwdriver\nbreak this apart and start looking at\nthe insides find the motherboard find\nthe CPU find the ram find the flipping\noptical drive and study all of these\nthings that you're learning in the\ncompta plus when I was taking this exam\nand studying for this exam I had a\nreally old laptop that was sitting in\nthe corner I broke it apart and studied\nwhere the CPU is where the ram is how\nmuch RAM is in there loads and loads of\nstuff like that and identified\neverything that I was learning in the\nCompTIA A+ courses and that is what\nreally helped me to fully grasp my\nunderstanding of fundamental it now if\nyou see this as an option for yourself\nand you want to start learning and\ngetting that fundamental understanding\nand taking the compta A+ then I'm going\nto put some links to some really good\ncourses for the compta A+ in the\ndescription of this video you can go and\nstart your Learning Journey with the\ncompy A+ courses so that's step one\ngetting the it fundamental now step two\nis a very important learning process and\nI've kind of put down step two as\ngetting a cyber focused course or\ncertification and I have an amazing list\nof courses and certifications that I can\ngo through with you guys and all of\nthese are pretty good and you kind of\nhave a few options when going into this\nand my first two options are options\nthat you can study and go for using\ncorsera now corser is a learning\nplatform that loads of people use it's\nprobably one of the most popular ones\nout there right now and just so you know\nI'm not being sponsored by Kera I'm\nactually saying this because it is a\nreally valuable platform and if you're\ntrying to get into cyber there are some\nreally good courses on there that could\nhelp you start that Journey now the\nfirst one I want to talk about is the\nMicrosoft cyber security analyst\nprofessional certificate now maybe I\nhave a little bit of bias to Microsoft\nstuff because I'm kind of a Microsoft\nand is your engineer and as your focused\nguy but I'm putting this as a really\ngood recommendation\nto start this journey there is also a\ncompeting Google certification which is\ncalled the Google cyber security\nprofessional certificate and both of\nthese courses are on corsera so if\nyou're interested in these go on and\nstart these coures one of the big things\nand great things about corsera is they\nhave a 7-Day free trial so you can start\nyour Learning Journey and if at any\npoint you decide this isn't for me you\ncan cancel that and move on if at some\npoint you decide yeah this Cera course\nis really good then you can start the\npaid version and continue the learning\nfrom there now another thing about the\nMicrosoft course is at the end of the\ncourse is that the course kind of also\nprepares you for the sc900 certification\nand when you're taking this course you\nalso get 50% off taking the\ncertification which is amazing and very\nbriefly looking over some of the stuff\ncovered in the course there's an\nintroduction to computers and operating\nsystems there's introduction to\nnetworking and cloud computing there's\neven a lot of stuff on identity and\naccess management and loads and loads\nmore now these these are two Great\nCourses I'd recommend I wouldn't\nrecommend one more than the other\ndespite my Microsoft bias so it's either\nyou prefer Google or you prefer\nMicrosoft but one of these courses is a\ngreat place for the second step of\ngetting that cyber security Corso\ncertification done now if you're not\ninterested in either of these there are\nother options that you can go for one of\nthese options is the really popular\nCompTIA Security Plus certification and\nanother one is a certification I've\nactually passed and made a video on\nwhich is called the ISC squ certified in\ncyber security Now now I haven't taken\nthe Security Plus so I can't say much\nabout the comparison between these two\ncertifications but what I have heard and\nI can say is that the Security Plus is\nslightly more Broad and practical and\nprobably a little bit better than the\ncertified in cyber security in some ways\nbut both of these certifications will\ngive you a good understanding and a\ngreat knowledge base for cyber security\nand help you to move forward into step\nthree now step three is to figure out\nwhat skills and areas of cyber security\nyour really interested in and through\nthe cyber security certification or\ncourse that you've just done this will\nslightly become more and more clear to\nyou maybe it's going into Cloud security\nmaybe it's going into pen testing maybe\nit's going into being a red team or a\nhacker or whatever but this will become\nmore and more clear and how do you\nsolidify the skills that you need to\nknow to get into these roles well it's\ntime to bring out the job description\nI'm on LinkedIn right now and I'm just\nsearching in a role in my area that I\nwould probably want to get into so cyber\nsecurity engineer now I've just found a\nrole as a security architect that I'm\nreally interested in now it's time to\nlook at the job description and look at\nthe requirements for this role this may\nnot be a role that you're directly going\nto apply for tomorrow but the point of\nthis exercise is to look at the skills\nand find out what skills they are\nlooking for in the person that will get\nthis role now some of the skills on here\ninclude knowledge in a security domain\nlike identity and access management now\nit's time to go away and from this job\ndescription figure out how to learn this\nskill it says it also wants some\nexperience in AWS some understanding of\nsecurity Technologies and whatever it\nsays on these job descriptions it's time\nfor you to go away and start learning\nwhat you've seen there are so many\ncourses whether it's on YouTube or\nflipping udemy or corera that you can\nuse to really learn and understand\nwhatever you see on the job description\nand most of the time you won't even have\nto pay for any of these courses you\ncould just go on YouTube and search for\na course on whatever you find and and\nthere's probably a really good course on\nthere for completely free I really\nstress how important it is to look at\njob descriptions and understand what\nemployers are actually looking for this\nwill really give you a good\nunderstanding of your journey and how to\nget to exactly where you want to be now\nlet's move on to step four and step four\nis basically just learning and doing a\nlot of projects on what you've learned\nfrom the previous step now the skills\nthat you found on the job descriptions\nis time to put them into practice and\nand like I said go after those courses\nonline to get a really good\nunderstanding of whatever is required\nwhatever that is and whatever skills are\nrequired it's really important to go and\ndo some projects and to actually have\nsome practical understanding of these\nthings and not just a theoretical one so\nto get a practical understanding\nprojects are required and generally\nthere are so many cyber security\nprojects out here on YouTube loads of\ncreators put out these projects to give\npeople a really good understanding of\nwhat to do practically and I'll put some\nof these up here from some of my\nfavorite YouTubers that really put out a\nlot of content in these areas and help\npeople with projects to understand\nthings a lot better so check those\nvideos out and there are loads more on\nYouTube now once you've done these\nprojects it's really important to\ndocument what you've done and be able to\nspeak about these things in an interview\nso make sure that these projects are\nreally well represented in your CV\nexactly what you've done explained in a\nfew short sentences give a hiring\nmanager a good understanding that you've\nactually gone through this and have a\ngood practical understanding of this\nthing that you'll probably be working on\nif you get the job they're interviewing\nyou for so making sure this is well\nrepresented on a CV and also being able\nto discuss this thing in an interview\nsetting is really important step five is\nthe job search and this is a really\ninteresting thing because when we talk\nabout the job search for cyber security\nthere's loads of things we could say\nthere's a lot of talk about how much\nexperience you have now a lot of the\ntime you look at cyber security roles\nonline and they'll be asking for 5 years\nexperience 10 years experience 7 years\nexperience and whatever the case may be\nand loads of times this is really really\ndiscouraged how are you going to get a\njob to get experience when all the jobs\nare requiring loads of experience it\ndoesn't make sense now a lot of people\nsay there is no way you can get a cyber\nsecurity role as your first role and\nalthough that's not true you can get a\nfirst role in cyber security a lot of\nthe times it can be really difficult and\nthere's not as many entry-level roles in\ncyber as there are in other areas of\ntech like an IT support engineer on the\nhelp disk is a first role that loads and\nloads of\ngo through and if you're struggling to\nfind roles that will take on entry level\ncyber security Engineers or or analysts\nthen it's a great idea to go into an IT\nsupport role as your first role and once\nyou have a bit of experience in it\nsupport then you can start to look and\nmove on to the cyber security roles now\nlike I said at the beginning roles like\nit support or even infrastructure\nengineering or many other roles have a\nlot of concepts of cyber security within\nthem so if you happen to get a first\nrole that is not in cyber and cyber is\nyour ultimate goal when you are moving\non into cyber security do use your\nunderstanding that you've gained for\nyour previous role to get that cyber\nsecurity role be able to speak about the\naspects of cyber security that you\ncovered in your current role and this\nwill really help now another big thing\nthat I will say is that loads of people\nget stuck in that first role especially\nwhen we talk about it support people go\ninto it support and they get locked in\nand are not able to find the way out out\nto their end goal which is either cyber\nor maybe it's cloud or maybe it's some\nother area but once you get stuck in\nthat role you either get super\ncomfortable and forget to move on and\nthis part of the video is just a\nreminder to focus on the end goal if\nyour end goal is to get into cyber\nsecurity and to break in as a cyber\nsecurity engineer if your first job is\nin the is at the help desk or maybe some\nother role make sure you're seeing this\nas a way to get experience to reach that\nrole as you're working in these roles\nkeep your learning going in cyber and\ncyber security areas and that will\nreally help you to focus on that end\ngoal and eventually after gaining the\nexperience you need moving on into the\nrole that you really want to be guys I\nhope this video has been really really\ngood in helping some beginners to\nunderstand the way that they can get\ninto cyber security and guys if you\nfound any value from this video please\nleave a like below I want to get this\nvideo out to as many people that are\nstarting their Journeys in cyber\nsecurity so they can have a great road\nmap that they can use to get started and\nif this has really impacted you or\nhelped you to go further in your career\nplease leave a comment and let me know\nhow this has helped thank you guys for\nwatching and I'll see you in the next\n[Music]\nvideo\n",
