  "text": "how can you practice good cyber security\nin your own life here's five tips for\npersonal cyber security that you can\nimplement yourself\neverything you do today leaves an\nelectronic signature that's just a fact\nof modern life but there are some things\nthat you can do yourself to reduce the\nrisk of your own personal security\nbreach and reduce the severity if it\ndoes happen to you number one is\nactually pretty simple consider renaming\nyour phone you might actually be giving\nyour name and phone model number to\nevery stranger you meet cyber security\ncompliments physical security allowing\nyour phone's model number as its name is\na great way of letting a street criminal\nknow who to rob first and giving your\nphone your own name might give a\ncriminal a couple of extra seconds of\nadvantage when they call out your name\nand you wonder for a few seconds how you\nknow this person so instead of calling\nyour phone sarah's iphone 12 or jim's\npixel 5 just give your phone a generic\nname my phone just says phone the second\nstep is a vpn so let's take a field trip\nnow this part of the video is sponsored\nby atlas vpn but this isn't one of those\nthings where i'm gonna talk about how\nyou can stream movies from different\ncountries now a vpn or a virtual private\nnetwork is a software tool that allows\nyou to encrypt your data from your\ncomputer or your phone all the way up to\nthe vpn provider once it gets to the vpn\nprovider the vpn provider can actually\nhide your location i'm sure you've seen\nplenty of youtube commercials where they\ngo on about watching streaming video\nservices in different countries and such\nand that is one advantage of the vpn but\nhere's another advantage okay behind me\nis a famous coffee shop and they've been\nshut down for months now so why is their\nwi-fi still on\nokay check this out\none of my options for connecting to\nwi-fi is coffee shop free wi-fi secured\noh how can i connect to this coffee shop\nwi-fi if the place has been shut down\nfor months well that's because it's me i\nhave something called a pineapple router\nin this bag right here and this\npineapple router is sucking down\ninformation from people who want to\nconnect to it\nand you can name it anything you want\nand that means that i'm sucking down\ndata from everybody who gets off of the\nsilver spring metro stop if they try\nconnecting to this route so i'm sure you\ncan see why you might want to encrypt\nfrom your device to the public internet\nso atlas vpn is offering a heck of a\ndeal for subscribers to my channel if\nyou click on the link in the description\nbelow you can actually get atlas vpn for\nthree years for\n1.99 a month that's that's a heck of a\ndeal it's normally like 10 bucks\nso it's pretty darn easy to trick\nsomeone into thinking that they have a\nvalid wi-fi connection and something\nlike atlas vpn creates a tunnel between\nyour device\nand the public internet that way bad\nguys and hackers and the government\ncan't see your data\nand if you don't use a laptop out in\npublic atlas vpn is available for iphone\nand android it's even available for fire\nstick so again atlas vpn is having a\nsale click on the link in the\ndescription below you can get atlas vpn\nfor three years for only 1.99 a month\nthat's down from the normal price of 10\nbucks a month totally worth it protect\nyour computer protect your phone number\nthree don't reuse passwords your\npassword is only as good as the least\nsecure website that you signed up for so\nlet's say you do all of your online\nbanking at a major bank you can be\npretty sure that bank's cyber security\nis probably pretty darn good but then\nyou sign up for a mobile game or one of\nthose free to play web games and you use\nthe same username and password that\nyou've used for your bank while the game\nmight not have the same cyber security\nas the bank if hackers break into the\ngame and steal your username and\npassword they might try that username\nand password at the bank and now hackers\nhave access to your financial data now\nyou might think your passwords are all\nencrypted but they're kind of not\nthey're not encrypted they're hashed now\na hash is a one-way mathematical\nfunction that takes your plain text\npassword and turns it into a jumbo of\nletters and numbers now once you send\nsomething through this mathematical hash\nyou can't reverse it it's like turning a\npotato into a hash brown the hash brown\ncan never again be a potato now when you\nfirst sign up for a website your\npassword is hashed and put in the\ndatabase and then when you log in that\npassword is dynamically hashed and\ncompared to the hash password that's on\nfile so it's actually possible for you\nto build a table of every single\npossible word in its equivalent hash\nthis is called a rainbow table this\nmeans that if you can steal a list of\nhashed passwords you can actually\nreverse look up those hash passwords and\nfigure out what someone might use for\ntheir normal plain text password now\nthere is a way for websites to make your\npassword less obvious when it's hashed\nit's called salting but you have no idea\nwhether the website you're signing up\nfor is doing that or not the fourth\nthing you can do is something called two\nform factor authentication not all\ncompanies offer this but if they do\noffer it you should take advantage of it\nnow when i log into my bank i get an\noption to generate a code that can\neither be texted to me i can get a call\ni can get a push notification on my\nbank's app i can get an email i can call\nthem now having to go through that\nsecond factor might be a bit of a pain\nbut it is totally worth it because it\nmakes your access far more secure since\nthat second factor is only triggered\nwhen someone tries to access your\naccount it lets you know if someone who\nis unauthorized is trying to access your\naccount and if the website lets you\nchoose make sure the code is sent to an\napp instead of over text message or\nemail since text message and email can\nbe insecure the fifth tip is to create a\nmachine of high trust this means getting\na separate machine and a separate email\njust for financial transactions so this\nis a chromebook and i got it for like\n200 bucks off of amazon this is the only\nthing i access my bank or financial\ninformation on if i transfer money i do\nit on the chromebook if i trade a stock\ni do it on the chromebook if i pay a\ncredit card i do it on the chromebook i\nalso have a special email that i only\nuse for financial institutions you can\ndo the same thing just by getting a free\ngmail or yahoo mail account and calling\nit\nyourname.lastname.bank or whatever this\nhelps prevent phishing attacks because\nit reduces impulsivity only a couple of\ncompanies have that email address and\nyou only check that email on that\nphysical segregated device so those are\nthe five tips if you take away anything\ni want you to understand that cyber\nsecurity is always a trade-off between\nsecurity and convenience but a little\nbit of added inconvenience can go a long\nway to keep you secure thank you for\nwatching\n[Music]\n",
