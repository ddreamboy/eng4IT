  "text": "python has more than 400 000 packages\nbut if you want to build a career in\ndata science you better know these eight\npython modules that you'll be using very\nfrequently as a data scientist so let's\nstart with the first one which is numpy\nif you're manipulating huge volume of\nsequential data and if you're using\npython list then your life is going to\nbe slow\nfor that reason you need numpy which\nprovides n dimensional array object that\nis very very memory efficient and fast\nas well it also provides so many\nready-made built-in functions that you\nwill be using often for your needs I'm\ngoing to provide you a reference of\nnumpy tutorial playlist which even a\nhigh school student can understand it\neasily the second one is pandas pandas\nis built on top of numpy array and it\nprovides fast and memory efficient\ntabular data structure called Data frame\nnow if you are doing exploded data\nanalysis or machine learning you will\nhave to use pandas go check any jupyter\nNotebook on Kegel most of them are using\npandas already now let's say you are\ndoing Simple weather analysis and if you\nuse plane python for that you will have\nto write 70 lines of code and the same\nthing can be done in five lines in Panda\nso it's super convenient I have\nexplained that in my very first video in\npandas tutorial playlist on YouTube\nwhich received more than 2 million views\nso check out the free YouTube tutorial\nplaylist Link in the video description\nbelow the next one is matplotlib or\nseabon you can use one of these\nlibraries for doing data visualization\nlet's say as a data scientist you are\ndoing exploratory data analysis now you\nwant to find outliers or you want to\njust visualize some data patterns or\nmaybe you want to plot a confusion\nmetrics after your machine learning\nmodel is built for all of these purposes\nmatlord lib or c bond can be extremely\nuseful they are very very popular in\ndata science Community once again there\nis a playlist for this then comes\nScrappy or beautiful soup again you\ndon't have to use two libraries you can\nuse one of them and these are used for\nweb crowling now if you look at any data\nscience project the first step in that\nproject is always data collection you\ncan collect data either from your\norganization or you can buy ready with\nthird-party data but often users see\ndata scientists do web scraping they go\nto internet it and they scrap different\nwebsites for collecting the data and in\nPython's capping beautiful soups are the\ntwo main libraries for this purpose then\ncomes our 800 pound gorilla called\npsychic learn if you want to do\nstatistical machine learning\nclassification or regression you have to\nuse scikit-learn it has become the de\nfacto library in the entire data science\nCommunity without the knowledge of\npsychic learn it will be very very hard\nto get a data scientist job once again\nhere is a machine learning playlist\nwhich has received more than 5 million\nviews and this playlist contains the\ntheory coding and exercises deep\nlearning is a sub domain of machine\nlearning where you use neural networks\nto solve variety of problems such as\nimage classification cats versus dogs\nthat's boring baby Yoda versus dog\nlanguage translation recommendation\nengine autonomous cars and so on\ntensorflow from Google and pytorch from\nFacebook are the two prominent libraries\nfor doing deep learning once again for\ntensorflow here is a free playlist which\nhas received again a huge on number of\nviews and that contains Theory coding\nand exercise Spacey is the next one it's\na library used to solve natural language\nprocessing or NLP problems so if your\ndata scientist who are working\nspecifically in NLP domain then you need\nto know this there are data scientists\nwho don't touch NLP problems in that\ncase it's okay to not have knowledge on\nthis Library the benefit of this library\nis that it is very good for beginners\nvery user friendly syntax and you can\nget started pretty fast there is another\nLibrary called nltk which people\nsometimes use along with space a but\nwith Spacey there are so many features\nwhich are inbuilt and you can get going\npretty fast you'll notice that the data\nscientists working in NLP domain will be\nusing space c NLP and they will be using\nsometimes pytos tensorflow Etc along\nwith these libraries so most of the time\nif you're solving any NLP problem you\nwill be using variety of libraries but\nPC seems to be the most popular among\nall once again here is an NLP playlist\nalong with Theory coding and exercises\nand this playlist uses Spacey as a\nlibrary the last one is opencv which is\nused for image processing so if you're a\ndata scientist working in image\nprocessing domain then you need to know\nthis opencv Library provides many\nready-made functions for doing image\nprocessing such as let's say you want to\nincrease the quality of an image and you\nwant to use adaptive thresholding you\ncan write few lines of code in opencv\nand there you go the quality is improved\nonce again similar to Spacey data\nscientists working in image processing\ndomain will be using many other\nlibraries along with opencv so they\nmight be using pytorch tensorflow Etc\nalong with opencv to solve a given\nbusiness problem now if you don't know\npython I have a nice python course on my\nwebsite codebasics.io and in that course\nwe have completed end-to-end project\nwhich is using opencv numpy pandas and\nmany other libraries which I have\nmentioned in this particular video so go\ncheck it out there are many videos in\nthat particular course which are\navailable for free and you can read the\ncourse reviews as well I hope you found\nthis video to be useful if you did\nplease share it with your friends who\nare trying to build a career in data\nscience if you have any questions that\nis a comment box below\nthank you\n[Music]\n",
