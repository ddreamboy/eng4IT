  "text": "what's going on everybody welcome back\nto another video today we're gonna be\ntaking a look at the differences between\na database a data warehouse and a data\nlake\n[Music]\nnow when i was first starting out i'd\nonly ever heard of a database and i\nthink that's what most people are\nfamiliar with but i had never heard of a\ndata warehouse or a data lake and so in\nthis video we're gonna be walking\nthrough the differences between each one\nof them as well as how they kind of\nconnect with one another so let's jump\nonto my screen and get started all right\nso we're gonna be taking a look at a\ndatabase a data warehouse and a data\nlake but let's start with a database now\nwhen someone says a database typically\nthey're referring to a relational\ndatabase now a relational database can\ncapture and store data via an oltp\nprocess which stands for online\ntransactional process so when company\ncompletes a transaction and sells an\nitem it'll record that within a database\nand that data has the ability to be live\nreal-time data data in a database is\ngoing to be stored in tables which has\ncolumns and rows and this will be highly\ndetailed which means you're going to be\nable to go in and see every single\naspect of the data and databases also\nhave a really flexible schema which\nmeans you can go in there and kind of\nchange things as you go to make it work\nfor what you need now a data warehouse\nis also a database just like we were\nlooking at before but it's going to be\nused for analytical processing or olap\nolap stands for online analytical\nprocessing and it's created to basically\nanalyze huge amounts of data now if you\nnotice on the last slide there were\nthese three databases they were just\nkind of sitting there and they were\nstoring the data in this visualization\nthat we have on the right these three\ndatabases on the bottom are all\naggregating and sending their data to\nthis data warehouse via an etl process\nwhich is where it extracts the data it\ntransforms it and loads it exactly how\nthey need it in this data warehouse and\nthat's how data is put into the data\nwarehouse it isn't getting it directly\nfrom the source but it's being put into\na database and via the etl process is\nbeing updated as it goes or whenever the\netl process runs a data warehouse will\nalways have the historical data but it\nwon't always have the current data\nunless the etl process is running every\nsingle day or very frequently the data\nin the data warehouse is also a little\nbit different because we're doing this\netl process to get the data in there\nwe're not actually putting every single\npiece of data or every column and row in\nthere we're typically summarizing it and\nthen putting it in there which will\nallow us to process that data for our\nanalytical purposes much faster now a\ndata warehouse is going to have a much\nmore rigid schema so you really need to\nplan ahead with how you're going to put\nyour data into a data warehouse it's not\nas flexible as just a database so now\nlet's look at some of the key\ndifferences between a database and a\ndata warehouse a database is going to be\nused for recording transactions or a\ndata warehouse is going to be used for\nanalytics and reporting a database is\ngoing to have fresh and detailed data\nwhere a data warehouse is going to have\nsummarized data it's only going to be as\nfresh as the etl process is created a\ndatabase is going to be a little bit\nslower for querying large amounts of\ndata and when you do query large amounts\nof data it can actually slow down the\nprocessing of all those transactions a\ndata warehouse was designed for the\nexact opposite it was designed to be\nvery fast at querying and not slow down\nany processes because it isn't part of\nthat transaction processing at all so\nnow that we've looked at a database and\na data warehouse let's take a look at a\ndata lake a data lake was basically\ndesigned to capture any type of data\nthat you could possibly want it could be\na video a picture an image a document a\ngraph anything you could imagine that\nyou'd want to put in a database or store\nin some way you can store it in a data\nlake now there are a ton of use cases\nfor a data lake but i think people who\nwork with machine learning and ai get to\nuse it or benefit from it the most they\ncan use all that structured and\nunstructured data and create models to\nreally use it in its raw form where if\nyou want to use it for analytical\npurposes typically you're gonna have to\nclean it up a little bit and do a little\nbit more work to actually make it usable\nand so a dale lake is just that it's\nthis lake where you can basically throw\nany type of data in there but it's not\nalways super usable because you're just\nputting it in there in its raw form if\nyou want to use it for analytical\npurposes and reporting most of the time\nyou're going to want to clean that up\nand put it into a database or a data\nwarehouse so now when we're looking at\nall three they are all different and\nthey're all used for different purposes\nso no one option is better than another\nfor your data if you're using it just to\nrecord transactions a database is what\nyou should do and if you have a large\namount of data that's just too much for\nyour database to handle it sounds like\nyou might need a data warehouse and if\nyou have all this data they have no idea\nwhat to do with or it's unstructured\nsemi-structured data that you can't fit\ninto a database well then i highly\nrecommend using a data lake there really\nis no one size fits all all three of\nthese can be options for different uses\nand in fact you can use all three within\none company for just different things\nthat your company needs so i hope that\nthat was helpful learning the\ndifferences between a database a day\nwarehouse and a data lake again i had\nreally never used a data warehouse or a\ndata lake when i first got into\nanalytics but now that i've gotten\nhands-on experience with all of them\nthey're all really interesting can be\nused for so many different things so\nthank you so much for watching this\nvideo i really appreciate it if you like\nthis video be sure to like and subscribe\nbelow and i'll see you next video\n[Music]\n",
