  "text": "[Music]\njust as pollution was a side effect of\nthe Industrial Revolution so are the\nmany security vulnerabilities that come\nwith the increased Internet connectivity\ncyber attacks are exploitations of those\nvulnerabilities for the most part\nindividuals and businesses have found\nways to counter cyber attacks using a\nvariety of security measures and just\ngood old common sense hi guys my name is\nAria and today's session is all about\ncyber security threats we are going to\nexamine eight of the most common cyber\nsecurity threats that your business\ncould face and the ways to avoid them so\nbefore we actually jump into the session\nlet me give you how the session will\nactually work we are going to discuss\nthe most eight common cyber threats\nwe're going to discuss in particular\nwhat they are how the threat works and\nhow to protect yourself okay so now\nlet's jump in now cyber attacks are\ntaking place all the time even as we\nspeak\nthe security of some organization big or\nsmall is being compromised for example\nif you visit the site out here that is\nthreat cloud you can actually view all\nthe cyber attacks that are actually\nhappening right now let me just give you\na quick demonstration of how that looks\nlike okay so as you guys can see out\nhere these are all the places that are\nbeing compromised right now the red\nparts actually show us the part that is\nbeing compromised and the yellow places\nactually show us from where it's being\ncompromised strong ok as you guys can\nsee now that someone from the\nNetherlands is actually attacking this\nplace and someone from USA was attacked\nin Mexico it's a pretty interesting site\nand actually gives you a scale of how\nmany cyber attacks are actually\nhappening all the time in the world\nok now getting back I think looking at\nall these types of cyber attacks it's\nonly necessary that we educate ourselves\nabout all the types of cyber threats\nthat we have so these are the 8 cyber\nthreats that we are going to be\ndiscussing today firstly we're going to\nstart with malware so malware is an\nall-encompassing term for a variety of\ncyber attacks including Trojans viruses\nand bombs malware is simply defined as\ncode with malicious intent that\ntypically steals data or destroy\nsomething on the computer the way\nmalware\nabout doing its damage can be helpful in\ncategorizing what kind of malware you\nare dealing with so let's discuss it so\nfirst of all viruses like the biological\nnamesakes viruses attach themselves to\nclean files and infect other clean files\nand they can spread uncontrollably\ndamaging a systems core functionality\nand deleting or corrupting files they\nusually appear as executable file is\nthat you might have downloaded from the\ninternet then there are also Trojans now\nthis kind of malware disguises itself as\nlegitimate software or is included in\nlegitimate software that can be tampered\nwith it tends to act as creat lis and\ncreates backdoors in your security to\nlet other malware sin' then we have\nworms worms in fact entire networks of\ndevices either local or across the\ninternet by using the network's\ninterfaces it uses each consecutive\ninfected machine to infect more and then\nwe have botnets and such where botnets\nare networks of infected computers that\nare made to work together under the\ncontroller of an attacker so basically\nyou can encounter malware if you have\nsome OS vulnerabilities or if you\ndownload some L legitimate software from\nsomewhere or you have some other email\nattachment that was compromised with\nokay so how exactly do you remove\nmalware or how exactly do you fight\nagainst it well each form of malware has\nits own way of infecting and damaging\ncomputers and data and so each one\nrequires a different malware removal\nmethod the best way to prevent malware\nis to avoid clicking on links or\ndownloading attachments from unknown\nsenders and this is sometimes done by\ndeploying a robust and updated firewall\nwhich prevents the transfer of large\ndata files over the network in a hope to\nweed out attachments that may contain\nmalware it's also important to make sure\nyour computer's operating system whether\nit be Windows Mac OS Linux uses the most\nup-to-date security updates and software\nprogrammers update programs frequently\nto address any holes or weak points and\nit's important to install all these\nupdates as well as to decrease your own\nsystem weaknesses so next up on our list\nof cyber threats we have phishing\nso what exactly is phishing well often\nposing as a request for data from a\ntrusted third party phishing attacks are\nsent via email and ask users to click on\na link and enter their personal data\nphishing emails have gotten much more\nsophisticated in recent\nand making it difficult for some people\nto discern a legitimate request for an\ninformation from a false one\nnow phishing emails often fall into the\nsame category as spam but are way more\nharmful than just a simple ad so how\nexactly does phishing book well most\npeople associate phishing with email\nmessage that spoof or mimic bank credit\ncard companies or other businesses like\nAmazon eBay and Facebook these messages\nlook authentic and attempt to get\nvictims to reveal their personal\ninformation but email messages are only\none small piece of a phishing scam from\nbeginning to end the process involves\nfive steps the first step is planning\nthe fissure must decide which business\nto target and determine how to get email\naddresses for the customers of that\nbusiness then they must go through the\nsetup phase once they know which\nbusiness to spoof and who their victims\nare Fisher's create methods for\ndelivering the messages and collecting\nthe data then they have to execute the\nattack and this is the step most people\nare familiar with that is the Fisher\nsends the phony message that appears to\nbe from a reputable source\nafter that the Fisher records the\ninformation the victims enter into the\nwebpage or pop-up windows and in the\nlast step which is basically identity\ntheft and fraud the Fisher's use the\ninformation they've gathered to make\nillegal purchases or otherwise commit\nfraud and as many as 1/4 of the victims\nnever fully recover so how exactly can\nyou be actually preventing yourself from\ngetting fished well the only thing that\nyou can do is being aware of how\nphishing emails actually work so first\nof all a phishing email has some very\nspecific properties so firstly you will\nhave something like a very generalized\nway of addressing someone like your\nclient then your message will not be\nactually from a very reputable source so\nout here as you can see it's written as\nAmazon on the label but if you actually\ninspect the email address that it came\nfrom its from management at maison\ncanada dot CA which is not exactly your\nlegitimate Amazon address third you can\nactually hover over the redirect links\nand see where they actually redirect you\nto now this redirects me to wwf/e\namazon.com as you can see out here so\nbasically you know this is actually a\nphishing\nand you should actually report this\nemail to your administrators or anybody\nelse that you think is supposed to be\nconcerned with this also let me give you\nguys a quick demonstration on how\nphishing actually works from the\nperspective of an attacker so first of\nall I have actually created a phishing\nwebsite for harvesting Facebook\ncredentials I simply just took the\nsource code of the facebook login page\nand pasted it and then made a back-end\ncode in PHP which makes a log file of\nall the Facebook passwords that get\nactually entered onto the phishing page\nnow I've also sent myself an email as to\nmake sure this looks legitimate but this\nis only for spreading awareness so\nplease don't use this method for\nactually harvesting credentials that's\nactually a very legal thing to do so\nlet's get started first of all you will\ngo to your email and see that you get\nsome email saying the our Facebook\ncredentials has been compromised\nso when you open it it looks pretty\nlegit well I haven't made it look all\nthat legit it should look legit but the\npoint out here is to actually make you\naware of how this works\nso as you guys can see it says dear\nclient we have strong reasons to believe\nthat your credentials may have been\ncompromised and might have been used by\nsomeone else we have locked your\nFacebook account please click here to\nunlock sincerely Facebook associate team\nso if we actually click here we are\nactually redirected to a nice-looking\nFacebook page which is exactly how\nFacebook looks like when you're logging\nin now suppose I were to actually log in\nto my Facebook account which I won't\nI'll just use some random ID like this\nis an email address email com and let's\nput password as admin one two three and\nwe click login now since my facebook is\nactually already logged in it'll just\nredirect to facebook.com and you might\njust see me logged in but on a normal\ncomputer it'll just redirect you to\nwww.facebook.com which should just show\nthis site again okay so once I click log\nin out here all that the backend code\nthat I've written in PHP out here will\ndo\nis that it's gonna take all the\nparameters that have entered into this\nwebsite that is my email address and\npassword and just generate a log file\nabout so let's just hit login and see\nwhat happens so as you guys can see I've\nbeen redirected to the original Facebook\npage that is not meant for phishing and\non my system out here I have a log file\nand this log file will show exactly as\nyou can see I've fished out the email\naddress this is an email address email\ncomm and it's also showed the password\nthat is admin one two three so this is\nhow exactly phishing works you enter an\nemail address and you're entering the\nemail address on a phishing website and\nthen it just redirects you to the\noriginal site but by this time you've\nalready compromised your credentials so\nalways be careful when dealing with such\nemails so now jumping back to our\nsession the next type of cyber attacks\nwe are going to discuss is pass with the\ndocs so an attempt to obtain or decrypt\na user's password for illegal use is\nexactly what a password attack is\nhackers can use cracking programs\ndictionary attacks and password sniffers\nand password attacks password cracking\nrefers to various measures used to\ndiscover computer passwords this is\nusually accomplished by recovering\npasswords from data stored in or\ntransported from a computer system\npassword cracking is done by either\nrepeatedly guessing the password usually\nthrough a computer algorithm in which\nthe computer tries numerous combinations\nuntil the password is successfully\ndiscovered now password attacks can be\ndone for several reasons but the most\nmalicious reason is in order to gain\nunauthorized access to a computer with\nthe computer's owners awareness not\nbeing in place now this results in\ncybercrime such as stealing passwords\nfor the purpose of accessing bank\ninformation now today there are three\ncommon methods used to break into a\npassword-protected system the first is a\nbrute-force attack a hacker uses a\ncomputer program or script to try to log\nin with possible password combinations\nusually starting with the easiest to\nguess password so just think if a hacker\nhas a company list he or she can easily\nguess user names if even one of the\nusers has a password one two three he\nwill quickly be able to get in the next\nour dictionary attacks now a hacker uses\na program or script\ntry to login by cycling through the\ncombinations of common woods in contrast\nwith brute-force attacks where a large\nproportion key space is searched\nsystematically a dictionary attack try\nis only those possibilities which are\nmost likely to succeed\ntypically derive from a list of words\nfor example a dictionary generally\ndictionary attacks succeed because most\npeople have a tendency to choose\npasswords which are short or such as\nsingle words found in the dictionaries\nor simple easy predicted variations on\nwords such as appending a digit also now\nthe last kind of password attacks are\nused by keylogger attacks a hacker uses\na program to track all of the user's\nkeystrokes so at the end of the day\neverything the user has typed including\nthe login IDs and passwords have been\nrecorded a key logger attack is\ndifferent than a brute-force or\ndictionary attack in many ways not the\nleast of which the key login program\nused is a malware that must first make\nit onto the user's device and the key\nlogger attacks are also different\nbecause stronger passwords don't provide\nmuch protection against them which is\none reason that multi-factor\nauthentication is becoming a must-have\nfor all businesses and organizations now\nthe only way to stop yourself from\ngetting killed in the whole password\nattack conundrum is by actually\npracticing the best practices that are\nbeing discussed in the whole industry\nabout passwords so basically you should\nupdate your password regularly you\nshould use alpha numerics in your\npassword and you should never use words\nthat are actually in the dictionary it's\nalways advisable to use garbage words\nthat makes no sense for passwords as\nthey just increase your security so\nmoving on we're going to discuss DDoS\nattacks so what exactly is a DDoS or a\nDOS attack well first of all it stands\nfor distributed denial of service and a\ndos attacks focuses on disrupting the\nservice to a network as the name\nsuggests attackers send high volume of\ndata of traffic through the network\nuntil the network becomes overloaded and\ncan no longer function so there are a\nfew different ways attackers can achieve\ndos attack but the most common is the\ndistributed denial of service attack\nthis involves the attacker using\nmultiple computers to send the traffic\nor data that will overload the system in\nmany instances a person may not even\nrealize that his or her computer has\nbeen hijacked and a\ncontributing to the DOS attack now\ndisrupting services can have serious\nconsequences relating to security and\nonline access many instances of\nlarge-scale dos attacks have been\nimplemented as a single sign of protests\ntowards governments or individuals and\nhave led to severe punishment including\nmajor jail time so how can you prevent\ndos attacks against yourself well\nfirstly unless your company is huge it's\nrare that you would be even targeted by\nan outside group or attackers for a DOS\nattack your site or network could still\nfall victim to one however if another\norganization on your network is targeted\nnow the best way to prevent an\nadditional breach is to keep your system\nas secure as possible with regular\nsoftware updates online security\nmonitoring and monitoring of your data\nflow to identify any unusual or\nthreatening spikes in traffic before\nthey become a problem\ndos attacks can also be perpetrated by\nsimply cutting a table or dislodging a\nplug that connects your website server\nto the Internet so due diligence in\nphysically monitoring your connections\nis recommended as well okay so next up\non a list is man-in-the-middle attacks\nso by impersonating the endpoints in an\nonline information exchange the\nman-in-the-middle attack can obtain\ninformation from the end user and the\nentity he or she is communicating with\nfor example if you are banking online\nthe man in the middle would communicate\nwith you by impersonating your bank and\ncommunicate with the bank by\nimpersonating you the man in the middle\nwould then receive all of the\ninformation transferred between both\nparties which could include sensitive\ndata such as bank accounts and personal\ninformation so how does it exactly work\nnormally an MIT M gains access through a\nnon encrypted wireless access point\nwhich is basically one that doesn't use\nWEP WPA or any of the other security\nmeasures then they would have to access\nall the information being transferred\nbetween both parties by actually\nspoofing something called address\nresolution protocol that is the protocol\nthat is used when you are actually\nconnecting to your gateway from your\ncomputer so how can you exactly prevent\nMIT M attacks from happening against you\nfirstly you have to use an encrypted W\nAP that is an encrypted wireless access\npoint\nnext you should always check the\nsecurity of your connection because when\nsomebody is actually trying to\ncompromise your security he will try to\nactually strip down the SC DPS or SSDs\nthat is being injected in the website\nwhich is basically the security\nprotocols so if something like this\nHTTPS is not appearing in your website\nyou're on an insecure website where your\ncredentials or your information can be\ncompromised and the last and final\nmeasure that you can actually use is by\ninvesting in a virtual private network\nwhich spoofs your entire IP and you can\njust browse the Internet\nwith perfect comfort next up on our list\nis drive-by downloads so gone are the\ndays where you have to click to accept a\ndownload or install a software update in\norder to become infected\nnow just opening a compromised webpage\ncould allow dangerous code to install on\nyour device you just need to visit or\ndrive by a webpage without stopping or\nto click accept any software add the\nmalicious code can download in the\nbackground to your device a drive-by\ndownload refers to the unintentional\ndownload of a virus or malicious\nsoftware onto your computer or mobile\ndevice a drive-by download will usually\ntake advantage or exploit a browser or\napp or operating system that is out of\ndate and has security flaws this initial\ncode that is downloaded it is often very\nsmall and since this job is often simply\nto contact another computer of where it\ncan pull down the rest of the code onto\nyour smartphone tablet or other\ncomputers often a web page will contain\nseveral different types of malicious\ncode in hopes that one of them will\nmatch a weakness on your computer so how\ndoes this exactly work\nwell first you visit the site and during\nthe 3-way handshake connection of the\ntcp/ip protocol a Bacchan script is\ntriggered as soon as a connection is\nmade vile the last ACK packet is sent a\ndownload is also triggered and the\nmalware is basically injected into your\nsystem now the best advice I can share\nabout avoiding drive-by downloads is to\navoid visiting websites that could be\nconsidered dangerous or malicious this\nincludes adult content file sharing\nwebsites or anything that offers you a\nfree trip to the Bahamas now some other\ntips to stay protected include keep your\ninternet browser and operating system\nup-to-date\nuse a safe search protocol that warns\nyou when to navigate to a malicious site\nand use comprehensive security software\non all your devices like McAfee\nall-access and keeping it up to date\nokay so that was it about drive-by\ndownloads next up is my lad vert icing\nor malvert icing so malvert icing is the\nname we in the security industry give to\ncriminally controlled advertisements\nwhich intentionally infect people and\nbusinesses these can be any ad on any\nsite often ones which you use as a part\nof your everyday internet usage and it\nis a growing problem as is evident by a\nrecent US Senate report and the\nestablishment of bodies like trust in\nads now whilst the technology being used\nin the background is very advanced the\nway it presents to the person being\ninfected is simple to all intents and\npurposes the advertisement looks the\nsame as any other but has been placed by\ncriminal like you can see the mint ad\nout here it's really out of place so you\ncould say it's been made by a criminal\nnow without your knowledge a tiny piece\nof code hidden deep in the advertisement\nis making your computer go to the\ncriminal servers these and catalog\ndetails about your computer and its\nlocation before choosing which piece of\nmalware to send you and this doesn't\nneed a new browser window and you won't\nknow about it so basically you're\nredirected to some criminal server the\nmalware injection takes place and voila\nyou're infected it's a pretty dangerous\nthing to be in so how exactly can you\nstop magnetising well first of all you\nneed to use an ad blocker which is a\nvery must in this day and age you can\nhave ad blocker extensions installed on\nyour browser whether it be Chrome Safari\nor Mozilla also regular software updates\nof your browser and other software's\nthat work peripheral to your browser\nalways help and next is some common\nsense any advertisement that is about\nlottery that's offering you free money\nis probably going to scam you and inject\nmalware too so never click on those ads\nso the last kind of cyberattacks we are\ngoing to discover today and discuss\nabout is rogue software so rogue\nsecurity software is a form of malicious\nsoftware and Internet fraud that\nmisleads users into believing that there\nis a virus on their computer and\nmanipulates them into paying money for a\nfake malware removal tool it is a form\nof scare that manipulates users through\nfear and a form of ransomware rogue\nsecurity software has been a serious\nsecurity threat in desktop computing\nsince 2008 so now how does a rogue\nsecurity software book these scams\nmanipulating users into download the\nprogram through a variety of techniques\nsome of these methods include ads\noffering free or trial versions of\nsecurity programs often pricey upgrades\nare encouraging the purchase of the\ndeluxe versions then also pop-ups\nwarning that your computer is infected\nwith the virus which encourages you to\nclean it by clicking on the program and\nthen manipulated SEO rankings that put\ninfected website as the top hits when\nyou search these links then read\ndirectly to a landing page that claims\nyour machine is infected and encourages\nyou a free trial of the rogue security\nprogram\nnow once the scareware is installed it\ncan steal all your information slow your\ncomputer or corrupt your files disable\nupdates for Less limit antivirus\nsoftware or even prevent you from\nvisiting less timet security software\nvendor sites while talking about\nprevention the best defense is a good\noffense and in this case an updated\nfirewall makes sure that you have a\nworking one in your office that protects\nyou and your employees from these type\nof attacks it is also a good idea to\ninstall a trusted antivirus or anti\nspyware software program that can detect\nthreats like these and also a general\nlevel of distrust on the internet and\nnot actually believing anything right\noff the bat is the way to go ok guys so\nthat was me about all the a different\ntypes of cyber threats and how they\nactually work and how you could prevent\nthem I also hope you enjoyed the\ndemonstration I showed about phishing\nthat's it for me goodbye\nI hope you have enjoyed listening to\nthis video please be kind enough to like\nit and you can comment any of your\ndoubts and queries and we will reply\nthem at the earliest do look out for\nmore videos in our playlist and\nsubscribe to any rekha channel to learn\nmore happy learning\n",
