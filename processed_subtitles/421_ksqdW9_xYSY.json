  "text": "thank you so much and it's absolutely\nfantastic to be here I mean the first\nthing I have to say is that you live in\nan amazing place I mean it's really\nreally beautiful and and if they kick me\nout of the UK because I'm Italian we\nbrag say I might actually move here so\njustjust I seriously consider it if\nproxy ever happens we don't know so I\njust wanted to say a few things so first\nof all this is I work on ethical AI so I\nthink this is a massive buzzword I mean\neverybody's talking about it and the key\nthing is we don't know what that really\nmeans and and I just wanted to try and\ndiscuss it we do because because I think\nyou are playing a key role in this and\nwhat we've seen happening over the last\nfew weeks at Google is absolutely\nfantastic so I just want to start with\nthis so did you see what happened with\nGoogle when they set up their ethics\nadvisory board so they set it off and\ngreat but what they did is that they put\nsomebody on their board who is coming\nfrom the Heritage Foundation which is a\nvery climate change denial organization\nvery sort of right-wing but apart from\nthat what is really really important I\nthink is that the people working on\nGoogle they signed a letter and they\nsaid we're not happy with it yeah and\nthat's what many people across the world\nto people like me work in empowering\nespecially women that have come to that\nwe call engineering activism which is\nthe fact word when it comes to machine\nlearning when he comes to creating\nthings which are rather transformative\nbecause they transformed the way we are\nthe women they make decision the way the\norganization's operate it has to be done\nin a proper way whereby controls in\nplace and with with a very strategy and\na lot of people working in the sector\nthey're starting to say have they\nwanting to have a say and what happened\nto Google over the last few weeks has\nbeen in\nbecause then Google said well we have to\ngo back to square one now whether the\ndecision of doing that board in that way\nor not was the right one will come to\nthat but what matters is that across the\nworld what we are seeing is that people\nlike you working day-in day-out at the\ncutting edge and really the full front\nof change you are starting to make the\ndifference and and really shaping up the\ndebate about ethics\nso everybody's talking about ethics\nright now I mean it's really strange\nbecause I go to like so many events so\ngo to like European Commission British\nParliament at the UN and even that\nrecently there you Oct and everybody\nwanted to talk about ethics and there is\nproblem with that which is that we need\nto define what ethics is in the first\nplace so I want to talk about it I also\nrun an organization called women lady in\nartificial intelligence we set up in\n2018 and the reason why we did is that\nthe word not enough women not just\nenough women in coated enough women in\nmachine learning in official\nintelligence but not enough women\nshaping their debate around it where is\nthis going\nwhat is it's not just about fixing\nalgorithms when it comes to bias and\nfairness but it's also the step behind\nbefore that which is what is this for\nand so we set up these organizations\nwith turnover one day I wrote an article\nin The Guardian I was like I'm really\ntired you know there's like who is\nshaving this debate and within two hours\nhave received hundreds of messages\ncoming from everywhere in the world from\nAustralia to Sweden the u.s. the Brazil\nand we set up this organization and\nwe've recently launched a manifesto\ncalled ten principle for ethical Adi and\nwe launched it into the British\nParliament and at the Council of Europe\nconference on AI\nand it's and it's it's going really well\nbut but yeah politician don't so seem to\nto to yet understand what we're really\ntalking about but I'll come to that so\nquickly this is what I'm going to talk\nabout why it matters the key issues\naround privacy and ethics where I would\nlike to see the machine learning\ncommunity as it was said before the\nmachine learning community is about\ndoing the right thing and this is\nwhere I would like you lead in the way\nnot just here in Sweden but everywhere I\njust want to tell like what the key\nissues are on the privacy and ethics\nside and then what possible solutions\nand regulations of artificial\nintelligence system so I'm gonna start\none thing 2018 last year was a\nbreakthrough so what happened last year\nwe had came me to analytical what\nhappened last year we had the first\nvictim of a driverless car what happened\nlast year's red Amazon almost we didn't\nin the end but release the software for\nrecruitment purposes there was only\npicking up female Seavey's male civvies\nI wish male civvies Freudian slip and so\n2018 was a rather big year and what they\ndid was so showing to us was that\nunregulated and I don't mean heavy\nregulation I mean agile regulation and\nregulated and accountable AI and\nunregulated and accountable use of big\ndata is really a khalid for very\ndangerous things and this is what\nhappened in 2018 so what we are talking\nabout when we talk about ethics my\nbackground is in in the privacy law but\nwhat we're talking about ethics at the\nmoment we're talking about it because\nbig things are arising in including for\nexample bias and unfairness in\nalgorithms we've seen for example in the\nu.s. what will happen with compass we've\nseen in in Google stay now if you type\nthat you're looking for and professional\nhaircut or whatever cut or what you get\nis the pictures of black women what we\nare seeing is is Facebook just recently\nit was demonstrated that 85% of highly\npaid job roles were only advertised to\nmen so what we've seen is bias but we're\nalso seeing is\nand accountable decisions made around\nhuman beings and access to housing\naccess to education and and access to\nthings that could be life-changing\nmany many local government has\norganizations in the UK for example I'm\nsure this is happening everywhere in the\nworld without people knowing they are\ndeploying artificial intelligence for\ndecisions they're often unaccountable\nand very difficult for people to appeal\nin the use in the u.s. this is happening\nall across the country and there's also\nbeen named as automation of inequality\nbecause so many people find it difficult\nto appeal to decisions for example about\naccess to credit in relation to\ncreditworthiness or housing decisions or\nawarding for example of tax credits and\nthey find it very difficult to appeal\ntherefore leading to what is called\nornament automation of inequality the\nproblem with the ethic debate is that we\nare talking about it and we're not\ntranslating that into practice and this\nis where your role comes in so what we\nare is happening at the moment is\neverybody's talking about it we're fully\nfalling in the sort of echo chamber well\nwe're all saying how important it is to\ndo the right thing but we're not really\nputting that into practice and then we\nare having the big question which is\nshould we regulate artificial\nintelligence is there something that\nread to be regulated and it's it's I\nalways worry a little bit when Mark\nZuckerberg comes around and say we need\nregulation because I think why you\nsaying that you know we have regulation\nit's called general data protection like\nthe regulation may not be enough may not\nbe enough but the key issue is do we\nregulate it\ndo we need codes of ethics do we need\nfor example certificate or fairness do\nwe need for example to leverage article\n42 of the general data protection\nregulation and encourage country to set\nup both to organizations to for example\ncertificate issued to kite marks or\ntrust marks to make sure that people can\ntrust the decisions or products or that\nour this in particular decisions they're\nmade by machine learning and then the\nother big thing which is around the\nrethinking the concept of privacy I mean\nwe live in a world where our data is\ncollected as you know all the time\nwhatever we do because we have a\nsmartphone or because we're live in a\nconnected home or because we take public\ntransport at every single time our data\nis collected and there is one huge\nproblem here which is the key concept of\ndata privacy when I went into law is\ndata minimization but our dreams they\nneed data so there is a conundrum here\nthere is big data and they one end and\ndata minimization on the other end we\nare at a moment in our society where we\ndo need to redefine the concept of\nprivacy and some people are saying how\ndo we redefine it howie's are they how\ndo we live as data citizen in the world\nthat we live in and there are some\npeople were talking about how do we\nrethink in privacy in the Arabic tech\nand for example I'm somebody who\nadvocates for group privacy rather than\nmainly focusing on individual privacy so\nwe know what that have just been saying\nthat data is collected every time the\nproducts I worked with organizations and\ndeploy machine learning for all across\nsectors it could particularly one of my\nkey focuses at the moment because of the\nethical implications of it is is around\nthe real-time bidding processing and and\nand and dynamic pricing because I'm\npassionate about it because it's where I\nthink ethically I becomes particularly\nimportant and sectors as I said that\neverywhere the company I work for we\nstarted in the energy sector so we do a\nlot of work around use of artificial\nintelligence in energy and how that can\nyou form make bestest better decision\nnot just in terms of pricing but in\nterms of of distribution of energy\nacross the grid so what we said is what\nare the key things around they've\nchanged and they make ethics complex in\nthe in machine learning so the key\nthings is round as we said they show up\ndata the problem is that they they use\nIrby data which is recent\nchanged the the landscape is around\nthere's got different characteristic\nfrom before so the first one is a to\npersistence it's probably the reason why\nI say to my children especially to my 14\nyear old going to first parties I say -\ndon't ever put a photo of yourself drunk\nat a party on Facebook because ten years\ndown the line when you're out looking\nfor your first job your employer might\nbe looking at that photo and decide the\nguys giving you a job\nthe problem with data that we're feeling\nright now these data persistence so the\nfact that once data is out there and you\nknow that is there to stay and people\nsay in very wrongly people say that data\nis in your oil well is not because once\nyou you you've used the oil it's used\nwith data you can use it over and over\nagain you can repurpose it you can and\nonce is there is there to stay there the\nproblem we have is about accuracy how do\nyou ensure accuracy all throughout the\nprocess in your systems and how do you\nmake sure the data that I provide now\nthat you may be using five years down\nthe line is still accurate and reflects\nme as the data subject and then the\nissue about transparency and we'll come\ninto that because this is where I really\nneed your help\nit's transparency which is about the\ntrade-off between the explained ability\nconcept and the and the efficiency of\nthe system that you are creating and\nthen of course we mentioned bias and\nthen we mentioned security so persistent\nwe spoke about it so there is really\nabout the fact that data is here to stay\naccuracy now the problem that we have\nwith data right now is called inferences\nthe problem we have is that you can\nunderstand things about me and very same\ncity things about me from data which is\nno sensitive at all for example\norganizations in financial sectors and\nespecially a new fantastic tech\norganizations companies working in the\nfinancial sector they're working on\ncredit worthiness and the fact and this\nis great and this is fantastic because\nyou can assess credit worthiness when\nindividuals that don't have the\ntraditional conditions to\nas product so for example a young couple\nthat doesn't have a background they've\nin in and and and paid jobs or in in the\npast you know they can access credit\nbecause they can demonstrate\ncreditworthiness in other ways but this\ncould also be very dangerous because you\nwere are the consequences of first of\nall assessing what creditworthiness is\nbut second were are the consequences of\nusing for example data coming from\nsocial media to understand where the\nsomebody can access credit or not\nbecause they are considered by some\nAuthority\nto be able to to repay their loans so\nthere is a very deep ethical issues of\nour ethical issues about that and those\nso for example from non sensitive data\nat all we are now able for example to\nunderstand whether somebody is entering\na manic state whether somebody's likely\nto commit suicide and this is happening\nall across Facebook and all across\nsocial media and the problem is what you\ndo with this information if you use this\ninformation for way which is considered\nethical that is fine but what happens if\nwe take this reasoning was there one\nstep forward and what happens if you can\nidentify people who are likely to commit\nsuicide or I've just on three day\nmessaging on Facebook and not just what\nwhat they've typed but what they have\ntyped and they haven't posted because\nthey've deleted well if we are able to\nunderstand from those information as\nsomebody has just entered a manic state\nand what happens if for example we start\ntargeting them with messages around a\ntrip to Las Vegas because we know the\nsomebody was just entered the manic\nstate is more likely to spend money so\nwhy am i mentioning all of this because\nthe ethical consequences around being\nable to extrapolate data which is very\nsensitive from information that is not\nsensitive at all it's quite dramatic and\nthis is another big issue that we are\nfacing at the moment and this is\ncompanies that work in a digital\nadvertising sector they particularly me\nto be aware about this what do you do\nabout in fair data and we're having a\nmassive debate in a legal community at\nthe moment around how far we can go in\ndefining infer data as personal data\nbecause the RAC contradictive opinions\nin different courts about it the other\nthing is when you develop your systems I\nwant you to be able to buy to\nunderstandable biases and this is where\nthere is a lot of confusions bias is not\na bad thing in itself\nthe problem is when bias becomes\nstereotyped and when the stereotype\nbecomes entrenched and becomes\nprejudiced and this is the race that\nwe're facing\nwhen machine learning artificial\nintelligence because we are scaling up\nall this a completely taking it to\nanother level\nI want to give you an example if you use\nand develop a facial intelligence\nsoftware tied into using it in in HR and\nso many composite companies I know they\nuse artificial intelligence in human\nresources to identify who is the best\ncandidate for a job but what happens\nwhen you come to when it comes to\ndefining good candidate good candidate\nwhat happens if you say good is somebody\nwho comes to work every time at 8\no'clock fair enough but what happens if\nyour office is near the Eiffel Tower in\nParis or in the Fifth Avenue man Adam\nboys going to be able to live nearby to\nbe able to come to the office at 8\no'clock a single mom with two kids\nno you're introducing bias by default\nwhat happens if you want to understand\nwho is more likely to carry a knife you\nlook at the sampling data that you have\nwhere is this data coming from is a\nsample but this data is historic data\nand black people are much more likely to\nbe stopped and searched in the street\nyou're introducing bias bias comes in\nfrom bias data obviously garbage in\ngarbage out and you know that\nbetter than me but is not about just\nabout buyers data it's also about the\nability of you when you produce a system\nwhen you create one to see where could\nthe buyers come from if I use class\nlabels if I use a specific variable am i\nintroducing bias without a noticing\nwithout knowing that if for example I\nuse a postcode and a postcode becomes\nparticularly relevant in the parameters\nthat I'm setting am i introducing bias\nfor example is that a postcode we're\nparticularly wealthy people live these\nare all thinking or conversations that\nyou need to have and when they work with\norganisations I always say to them have\nyou thought about all this is your\nworkforce diverse enough so that you can\nunderstand all these issues because the\nbias and the potential stereotypes that\nI can come up from with are very\ndifferent from what somebody else might\ncome up with this is why a diverse\nworkforce is very important but it's not\njust that I always say to organizations\nwhat is the governance that you have in\nplace are you doing something which is\nlike a first or second or third line of\ndefense to complicate it no it's not\nbecause you are the code is with the\nprogrammers yeah you come up with\nsomething but then you work with\norganization so you introduce machine\nlearning in your own organizations and\nyou have to think about all this but you\ncan't bear the responsibility on your\nshoulder all of it there has to be an\norganizational divert it's a strategy\nwho is involved with this and also is\nsomebody else involved with this are\ncitizens involved if for example they\ninvolves giving a loan or if there\ninvolves dynamic pricing or if they\ninvolves something which is so crucial\nto people life how much they spend where\ndo they get access or not - alone on\nwhether they see an advert or not which\ntrust me is a major thing a new\ndeveloping this system who is involved\nin these decisions was involved in\nthinking is they going to be biased or\nnot and my acciden\nTeli fallen into this trap am i\naccidentally going to serve a particular\nad only to specific people without even\nrealizing it these are all very\nimportant conversations that we need to\nhave now the gdpr is unhelpful one the\nGDP a helpful and unhelpful the GDP si\nsi is an article which is article 22 and\nthe GDP are says individuals have a\nright to access a minimum meaningful\ninformation where a decision about them\nis made yeah doesn't mean anything to\nsay what does it mean meaningful\ninformation who knows there would be for\na court to decide but you are\nprogramming this thing right so you have\nto be able to work with organizations\nthat deploying it or your own\norganizations deploying it they have to\ncomply with this legislation ok article\n22 says that the human in the loop\nbasically saying you know an individual\nhas the right to say I want my decision\nto be reviewed by a human but also but\nalso it says an article 71 is a recital\n71 it says explain the ability another\nword that I told I have to say it is\nlike because I don't really know what it\nmeans and I'll tell you why I don't know\nwhat it means because I don't want to\nknow how an airplane works last night I\nwent to the Norwegian allies I go on the\nplane I just want to know that somebody\nhas checked at the airplane if it to fly\nI'm not expected to know exactly how the\nengine works and all that but when you\nare out there when you create your\nsystems then organizations may say to\nyou well how do I comply with the gdpr\nso that's where the governance is\nimportant how are you going to ensure a\ndegree of accountability and\ntransparency where are you deciding that\nthe Cuttino fee is a trade-off is\nbetween explain ability and efficiency\nthis is a strategy this that\norganization has to make where is the\nrisk appetite\nhow does it match with the company\nvalues but that has to be clear you need\nto be able to say that you need to be\nable to say this is how individuals can\naccess information about me but about\nthem do you know what the consumer\ndirective at European level is currently\nbeen updated do you know why because we\ndynamic pricing we all get a different\nprice than we online and loads of I mean\nI have all my friends I'm doing dynamic\npricing and machine learning but the\nproblem is that this directive correctly\nis saying individuals when they offer to\nprize based on their availability to\nspend their browsing history and then\nthey tame whatever they need to be told\nthere and then that that price is not a\nfixed price but it's the result of\ndynamic pricing consumer rights how are\nyou going to explain that when you build\nyour system how are you going to make\nsure that your client if you sell it or\nif you're developing in-house if\nsomebody says to you I want to know how\nyou've come to that decision how do you\nexplain it and this is very important\nquickly check what the European Union\nthe group on ethical guidelines trust\nworth the a I know Sophie's ethically I\ntrust worth the a I could be a finally\npossible word to say exactly the same\nthing to say that privacy and ethics by\ndesign is what we're looking at I would\nhighly recommend to look at that\ndocument it came out yesterday and he\nalso includes a call to action which is\nthe reason AAA which is an algorithm\nimpact assessment in their test it and\nlet them know what you think tester\ntelling me see if he's easy and agile\nenough for you on the scientific side\nand the technical side to do it as much\nas is for us we'll see on the legal side\nto send on the ethical side and on the\nphilosophical debate to say that you\nhave to do it do it yourself try it\nalgorithmic impact assessment some\npeople say oh we've got a data\nprotection impact assess and merge it do\nit together\nnobody's stopping you to merge the two\nand nobody's saying to you that you\ncan't use one fantastic element of the\ndata privacy impact assessment which\nnobody uses is which is privacy by\nnegotiation which means can you involve\nthe public in this can you share what\nare the values in the pinning where\nyou're doing security the source is a\nbias we went through which is what I was\ntalking about the proxy is the\nintentional or non-intentional\ndiscrimination and this is the last\nthing I wanted to talk to you about you\nare doing something very important and\nyou are defined in how the future is\ngoing to be but I over worry at the\nmoment to the worry I have is that we\nare all talking about fixing an\nalgorithm and I indeed have spent much\nof my presentation talking about how to\nfix an algorithm which is about the bias\nthe algorithmic impact assessment\nprivacy Latics by design\ngovernance how is the organization going\nto roll out to to roll machine learning\napplications but there is one thing I do\nfear that everybody's talking about\nethics as a smokescreen I do feel that\neverybody's talking about ethics but I\nhave to fix an algorithm without asking\nthe main question which is what is this\nfor in the first place so can we all\nagree the artificial intelligence is\nthere to augment our capabilities to\nwork alongside us not replace us to\nenhance our humanity not to diss Manish\nit and can you as the AI machine\nlearning community pledge to this and if\nyou see something that doesn't feel\nright at all if you feel that you've\nworked on something but it's being used\nfor the wrong thing say it\ndo like Google have done do like Amazon\nhave done the employees where they've\nsaid you have this facial recognition\nprogram recognition but he fails to\nrecognize black women\nselling it I do argue the mushy Lenin\ncan be potentially enormous Lee\ntransformative but the problem is that\nthose defining the ethics are the ones\ndefining the trajectory and what a eyes\nneeds to be useful but this is a debate\nand needs to involve the whole community\nand I really hope that you from here in\nGothenburg alongside many others in\nLondon in the u.s. in Brazil everywhere\nin the world you the ones were actually\nthere doing it you can embrace this\nglobal engineering awareness that is\ngrowing and say we're gonna do it for\nthe right thing and if it's not for the\nright thing we're actually going to say\nit out loud I hope I was able to\nstimulate a bit of a debate and thank\nyou for listening three now we have some\nminutes for questions if anyone so I\nhave a question\ngreat talk first of all I think this is\na very important subject so it seems\nlike the outfall out of Cambridge\nanalytical was sort of a fair amount of\ncollateral damage and also some well\nintended stuff that didn't really play\nout the way it should have maybe and I'm\nconcerned about sort of the how broad\nthe brushstrokes are sometimes and how\nable we are to be precise for example is\nit relevant really to spend millions to\nblur faces on random pedestrians in the\ncountryside in Germany to build a\nself-driving car it seems like\ncollateral damage in an attempt to stop\nother things so do you have any thoughts\non how to be precise enough here to not\nhave too many unintended consequences\nyeah it's true I mean what say your for\nexample do you feel that we're going in\nso a direction which is\nplease waste the time in terms of for\nexample if you say if we have to or do\nyou feel that we have to reframe this\ndiscussion it seems like gdpr has like\nit's God in all the lawyers really\nreally afraid and confused and making a\nlot of things much harder than they\nmaybe need to be in the wrong like it's\nhitting the wrong targets in a lot of\ncases but I also have to be I mean\nhonestly I started being involved in\nprivacy when I was about 16 because I\nwent to the US as an exchange student\nand I found that the where cameras\neverywhere even in the toilet so the\nreason why I go involved into privacy\nwas because of that but at the same time\nI can fear why 99% of people when you\ntalk about these things would be like oh\nmy god he's the privacy person because\nhe can't get extremely boring can he and\nhe couldn't get boring because as you\nsay people seem to waste a lot of time\ndiscussing minor minor details\nso yesterday there was a one-er thority\nacross the EU spending entire and hours\nof discussions around whether when CVS\nof applicants are collected whether you\nknow whether they can be retained for a\nsmall time or whether they can be\ndestroyed I mean it's fine but we're\nmissing the point here aren't we and\nthat that is and on that I agree with\nyou but there is a key thing here though\nwhich is about who is making that\ndecision in terms of I mean you have a\ncommunity here and you say we are\ntogether because of the common good you\nknow so we want to say we want to do the\nright thing but have you asked yourself\nwhat does right look like or what is the\ncommon good would defines it you know\nthe problem with this is the same thing\nand what you were talking about what\nmatters most is that the faces of those\npeople or the right of to trial of a\ndriverless car you know that driverless\ncars are great I mean I look forward to\nit\nif any I mean I don't drive so you know\nit's fine but the driverless cars car as\nlong as I can steal cycle safely pissah\nbut driverless cars can reduce pollution\nit can be extremely safe it's great\nwho is making that decision that is more\nimportant to do that and and my fear is\nthat because we live in a world where\nthat all this stuff stems from the\ndigital and the digital\nwell this num is dominated by nine big\ncorporations my fear is that the people\nmaking those decisions exactly those\npeople and to be fair and and I fear for\nthis a little bit because because then\nyou know what's going to happen to all\nof us you know if any particular from a\nfeminist I'm proudly consider myself a\nfeminist you know well you know what has\nhappened what happens from a feminist\nperspective so there's my fear you know\nand when you did you're right about Judy\nso remember just rambling but you know\nbut I think you're right about Judy PR\nbut what I'm saying is that it's always\na trade-off isn't it and who is making\ntheir decision about what matters most\nthat's the question I think there's a\nlady in the back we have oh there will\nbe a mic well has there been any company\nthat has you know like an example that\nyou can give us to learn from on how to\nwork with this absolutely sorry I\nmentioned that if you look at the\nethical guidelines seconds give it a\nlink I didn't have time to put it cause\nit came out yes so I was in the play so\nthe the European Commission they just\nhad a high-level group on artificial\nintelligence and they've issued a report\nwhich has an inside it an algorithmic\nimpact assessment which is basically all\nthe things I've been talking to you\nabout and how to make sure they're\nembedded from did from from the start we\nall follow the same module because we're\nall part of the same group and also has\na really nice great about how to create\nthe right structure what is the\nresponsibility of coders programmers\nversus procurement a charm and\neverything so if you follow that that is\nthat it is really good I mean I work\nwith organization this is exactly what I\ndo you know setting up the governors and\nto look in a how to assess algorithms\nand I'll give you the link to my fortune\nyou don't have any more time for\nquestions but for anyone who is really\ninterested in the ethical discussion\nthere will be a panel later today so\nplease please come to that ask\nand thank you Anna Anna for the\nwonderful talk\nthank you so much\n[Applause]\n",
