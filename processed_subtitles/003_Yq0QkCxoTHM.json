  "text": "if you don't have a technical background\nbut you still want to learn the basics\nof artificial intelligence stick around\nbecause we were distilling Google's\n4-Hour AI course for beginners into just\n10 minutes I was initially very\nskeptical because I thought the course\nwould be too conceptual we're all about\npractical tips on this channel and\nknowing Google the course might just\ndisappear after 1 hour but I found the\nunderlying Concepts actually made me\nbetter at using tools like Chachi BT and\nGoogle bard and cleared up a bunch of\nmisconceptions I didn't know I had about\nAI machine learning and large language\nmodels so starting with the broadest\npossible question what is artificial\nintelligence it turns out and I'm so\nembarrassed to admit I didn't know this\nAI is an entire field of study like\nphysics and machine learning is a\nsubfield of AI much like how\nthermodynamics is a subfield of physics\ngoing down another level deep learning\nis a subset of machine learning and deep\nlearning models can be further broken\ndown into something called\ndiscriminative models and generative\nmodels large language models llms also\nfall under deep learning and right at\nthe intersection between generative and\nllms is the technology that powers the\napplications we're all familiar with\nchat gbt and Google bard let me know in\nthe comments if this was news to you as\nwell now that we have an understanding\nof the overall landscape and you see how\nthe different disciplines sit in\nrelation to each other let's go over the\nkey takeaways you should know for each\nlevel in a nutshell machine learning is\na program that uses input data to train\na model that trained model can then make\npredictions Based on data it has never\nseen before for example if you train a\nmodel based on Nike sales data you can\nthen use that model to predict how well\na new shoe from Adidas would sell based\non Adidas sales data two of the most\ncommon types of machine learning models\nare supervised and unsupervised learning\nmodels the key difference between the\ntwo is supervised models use labeled\ndata and unsupervised models use\nunlabeled data in this supervised\nexample we have historical data points\nthat plot the total bill amount at a\nrestaurant against the tip amount and\nhere the data is labeled Blue Dot equals\nthe order was picked up and yellow dot\nequals the order was delivered using a\nsupervised learning model we can now\npredict how much tip we can expect for\nthe next order given the bill amount and\nwhether it's picked up or delivered for\nunsupervised learning models we look at\nthe raw data and see if a naturally\nfalls into groups in this example we\nplotted the employee tenure at a company\nagainst their income we see this group\nof employees have a relatively High\nincome to years work ratio versus this\ngroup we can also see all these are\nunlabeled data if they were labeled we\nwould see male female years worked\ncompany function Etc we can now ask this\nunsupervised learning model to solve a\nproblem like if a new employee joins are\nthey on the FasTrack or not if they\nappear on on the left then yes if they\nappear on the right then no Pro tip\nanother big difference between the two\nmodels is that after a supervised\nlearning model makes a prediction it\nwill compare that prediction to the\ntraining data used to train that model\nand if there's a difference it tries to\nclose that Gap unsupervised learning\nmodels do not do this by the way this\nvideo is not sponsored but it is\nsupported by those of you who subscribe\nto my paid productivity newsletter on\nGoogle tips Link in the description if\nyou want to learn more now we have a\nbasic Gra as of machine learning it's a\ngood time to talk about deep learning\nwhich is just a type of machine learning\nthat uses something called artificial\nneural networks don't worry all you have\nto know for now is that artificial\nneural networks are inspired by the\nhuman brain and looks something like\nthis layers of nodes and neurons and the\nmore layers there are the more powerful\nthe model and because we have these\nneural networks we can now do something\ncalled semisupervised learning whereby a\ndeep learning model is trained on a\nsmall amount of labeled data and a large\namount of unlabeled data for example a\nbank might use deep learning models to\ndetect fraud the bank spends a bit of\ntime to tag or label 5% of transactions\nas either fraudulent or not fraudulent\nand they leave the remaining 95% of\ntransactions unlabeled because they\ndon't have the time or resources to\nlabel every transaction the magic\nhappens when the Deep learning model\nuses the 5% of label data to learn the\nbasic concepts of the task okay these\ntransactions are good and these are bad\nokay apply those learnings to the\nremaining 95% of unlabeled data and\nusing this new aggregate data set the\nmodel makes predictions for future\ntransactions that's pretty cool and\nwe're not done because deep learning can\nbe divided into two types discriminative\nand generative models discriminative\nmodels learn from the relationship\nbetween labels of data points and only\nhas the ability to classify those data\npoints fraud not fraud for example you\nhave a bunch of pictures or data points\nyou purposefully label some of them as\ncats and some of them as dogs a\ndiscriminative model will learn from the\nlabel cat or dog and if you submit a\npicture of a dog it will predict the\nlabel for that new data point a dog we\nfinally get to generative AI unlike\ndiscriminative models generative models\nlearn about the patterns in the training\ndata then after they receive some input\nfor example a text prompt from us they\ngenerate something new based on the\npatterns they just learned going back to\nthe animal example the pictures or data\npoints are not labeled as cater doog so\na generative model will look for\npatterns oh these data points all have\ntwo ears four legs a tail likes dog food\nand Barks when as to generate something\ncalled a dog the generative model\ngenerates a completely new image based\non the patterns it just learned there's\na super simple way to determine if\nsomething is generative AI or not if the\noutput is a number a class ification\nspam not spam or a probability it is not\ngenerative AI it is Gen AI when the\noutput is natural language text or a\nspeech an image or audio basically\ngenerative AI generates new samples that\nare similar to the data it was trained\non moving on to different generative AI\nmodel types most of us are familiar with\ntextto text models like Chach BT and\nGoogle bard other common model types\ninclude text to image models like midj\nDolly and stable diffusion these can not\nonly generate images but edit images as\nwell text to video models surprise\nsurprise can generate and edit video\nfootage examples include Google's\nimageen video Cog video and the Very\ncreatively named make a video text to 3D\nmodels are used to create game assets\nand a little known example would be open\nai's shape e model and finally text to\ntask models are trained to perform a\nspecific task for example if you type\nGmail summarize my unread emails Google\nbard will look through your inbox and\nsummarize your unread emails moving over\nto large language models don't forget\nthat llms are also a subset of deep\nlearning and although there is some\noverlap llms and geni are not the same\nthing an important distinction is that\nlarge language models are generally\npre-trained with a very large set of\ndata and then fine-tune for specific\npurposes what does that mean imagine you\nhave a pet dog it can be pre-trained\nwith basic commands like sit come down\nand stay it's a good boy and a\ngeneralist but if that same good boy\ngoes on to become a police dog a guide\ndog or hunting dog they need to receive\nspecific training so they're fine tuned\nfor that specialist role a similar idea\napplies to large language models they're\nfirst pre-trained to solve common\nlanguage problems like text\nclassification question answering\ndocument summarization and text\ngeneration then using smaller industry\nspecific data sets these llms are\nfine-tuned to solve specific problems in\nRetail Finance Healthcare entertainment\nand other fields in the real world this\nmight mean a hospital uses a pre-trained\nlarge language model from one of the big\ntech companies and fine-tunes that model\nwith its own first-party medical data to\nimprove diagnostic accuracy from X-rays\nand other medical tests this is a\nwin-win scenario because large companies\ncan spend billions developing general\npurpose large language models then sell\nthose llms to smaller institutions like\nretail companies Banks hospitals who\ndon't have the resources to develop\ntheir own large language models but they\nhave the domain specific data sets to\nfine-tune those models Pro tip if you do\nend up taking the full course I'll link\nit down below it's completely free when\nyou're taking notes you can right click\non the video player and copy video URL\nat the current time so can quickly\nnavigate back to that specific part of\nthe video there are five modules total\nand you get a badge after completing\neach module the content overall is a bit\nmore on the theoretical side so you\ndefinitely want to check out this video\non how to master prompting next see you\non the next video in the\nmeantime have a great one\n",
