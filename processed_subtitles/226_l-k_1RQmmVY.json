  "text": "Have you ever wondered how researchers consider\ndata as a part of their research proposal\nor project design?\nThis video will introduce you to data and\nethics, including questions for you to consider\nregarding your own information and research.\nWhat is data ethics?\nIn the broadest sense, data is simply a piece\nof information.\nData could be facts or statistics, which is\noften why we think about data as being numbers,\nbut data can be in a variety of forms.\nFor example, data could even be an image or\na physical sample (like a cell sample).\nAny time we start talking or even thinking\nabout data, we should also think about data ethics.\nAccording to the National Center for Biotechnology\nInformation, data ethics can be defined as,\n“a new branch of ethics that studies and\nevaluates moral problems related to data,\nalgorithms, and corresponding practices in\norder to formulate and support morally good\nsolutions.\"\nAdditionally, data ethics considers the how\nand in what way is sensitive data shared,\nmaintained, analyzed, and appropriated.\nSensitive data is personally identifiable\ninformation, such as human samples, survey\nresults, even your DNA.\nWhy do we need to consider ethics in data?\nWe need to consider ethics in data because\ndata is created every day, and this data is\nbecoming increasingly more and more detailed.\nHow we interact with this data is extremely important.\nWe also need to be mindful about where all of this data is coming from.\nLet’s look at Google as an example.\nEvery time you watch a YouTube video, go to\nGoogle maps, put something in your calendar,\nsearch something on a Google search engine,\nor send an email -- Google is collecting data.\nTo give you an idea of just how much data\nGoogle collects, they collect over 20 million\nweb pages per day, over 3 million daily search\nqueries, and according to CNN, Google can track\nyour searches on your individual devices for\nup to 6 months even if you’re not logged\nin to your account.\nThis example is just one of many to consider.\nAny time we think about data collection and\ndata ethics, we should ask ourselves: How\nis this data being used?\nHow is this data being shared?\nAnd what are the repercussions of this data\ncollection, short term and long term?\nWhat are some situations where you should\nconsider data ethics?\nAny time you’re about to start collecting\ndata or giving your data, you should consider\nthe ethical practices behind it.\nAs a student, an easy example for when you\nshould consider data ethics could be when\nyou fill out surveys.\nDid you provide any identifiable information\nin that survey?\nIf so, were you asked about consent before\nyou completed the survey?\nMoving forward,\nhow might you change what surveys you complete?\nOr, as a researcher how could you design a\nsurvey to address concerns that you yourself\nmay have when collecting data?\nAdditionally, how do you know you’re complying\nwith institutional requirements (and don’t\nworry, you’ll learn about these if you don’t\nknow now!).\nWhen should ethics be considered?\nAt the start of every research project!\nTo ensure you have the proper training, ask\nyour professor, research mentor, or a librarian\nfor help.\n",
