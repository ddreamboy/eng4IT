  "text": "[Music]\nhello everyone this is waseem from\nedureka and i welcome you all to the\nsession in which i am going to perform\npredictive analysis\nso let's take a look at the agenda for\nthis session first of all i'm going to\nbegin with the basic introduction to\npredictive analysis\nfollowed by a few applications moving\nfurther i will discuss the steps\ninvolved in predictive analysis\nand finally i will perform predictive\nanalysis on a data set\nusing python i hope you guys are clear\nwith the agenda\nalso don't forget to subscribe to\nedureka for more exciting tutorials\nand press the bell icon to get the\nlatest updates on edureka\nand to check out edireca's machine\nlearning certification program\nthe link is given in the description box\nbelow now without any further ado\nlet us understand what exactly\npredictive analysis is\nso what is predictive analysis\npredictive analytics or analysis\nencompasses a variety of statistical\ntechniques from data mining\npredictive modeling and machine learning\nthat actually analyze the current and\nhistorical facts\nto make predictions about future or\notherwise unknown events\nso this is the basic definition from\nwikipedia so we basically use the\npreviously collected data\nto predict an outcome or an event so\ntypically\nhistorical data is used to build a\nmathematical model\nin our case we can call it a classifier\nor a predictive model or a regressor\nwhich actually captures the important\ntrends and then the current\ndata is used on that model to predict\nwhat will happen next\nor to suggest actions to take optimal\noutcomes\nso let us take a look at various\napplications where we can actually use\npredictive analysis\nso we can use predictive analysis for a\nlot of things\nfirst of all we have campaign management\nso let's say we have a campaign we have\nto figure out what kind of\naudience will be there or what kind of\nour target audience is\nso we can analyze the previous data of\nour previous campaigns\nthat we might have managed previously\nand according to that we can\nfigure out some suggestions or you know\nthe course of action that we have to\ntake\nbut this is one campaign management that\nwe can do using the predictive analysis\nor for recent examples let's say an\nelection campaign you know a lot of\npeople\nare gathering a lot of data of previous\nelections like how it\nhappened and what are the major factors\nthat led to the winning of some so and\nso person\nso this is how we can use predictive\nanalysis in campaign management\nthen there is customer accusation so we\ncan analyze the whole business\nand we can figure out different points\nto you know figure out what kind of\ntasks or events we can actually produce\nin order to\nmake our business better so that we'll\nbe able to make customer acquisition\nbetter\nand then we have budgeting and\nforecasting as well similarly you know\ntaking a look at previous data we can\nfinalize some budget and forecast\nfew uh related pointers for example we\nhave stock prediction\nusing python or any other language such\nas r also\nand then we have fraud detection so we\ncan you know manage a lot of data\nlike for credit card companies they make\nuse of hundreds and hundreds of users\nand they analyze the data to predict or\nyou know detect the fraudulent\ntransactions in their data\nand then there is promotions as well so\nwe can analyze you know the target\naudience\nwe can uh follow the trends like they\nare following you know the types of\ncontent they're actually going for and\nthen similarly you can make promotions\naccording to that\nand there is pricing also like you can\nfigure out let's say you have a\nsupermarket somewhat like you know what\nwalmart does\nso you have all the pricing and\neverything so what you can do is\nfigure out the price of a product after\nseveral time based on the recent\npurchases\nand also the recent scenario or the\nprevious historical data\nupon which the price has been\ndistributed accordingly\nand you can also plan for the demand as\nwell using the predictive analysis\nso these are a few applications that i\ncan think of right now and\nthese are only a few applications where\nyou can use predictive analysis\nto predict the for example i'll talk\nabout football guys\nso let's say if you have a favorite\nplayer and in the next season you want\nto see how much price\nhe might go for in certain other clubs\nso you can make use of the data at your\nbay\nand depending on the purchases that\nhappen in previous seasons\nor the windows you can actually figure\nout somewhat around what kind of price\nyour favorite player is gonna go for so\nthat is one example i can think of right\nnow so these are a few applications of\npredictive analysis\nnow let's move on to the next topic of\nthe session guys which is\nsteps involved in predictive analysis so\nthis is a very important concept in this\nsession guys\nso you have to fully understand what\nkind of steps that goes in while you're\ndoing a predictive analysis\nso the first step has to be a data\nexploration so what you have to do is\ngather data\nuploaded into your program then you have\nto take a look at your data in\na perspective which will clear certain\nthings for you like you have to\nfigure out what kind of data you're\ndealing with what are the columns what\nare the features that you have inside\nyour data\nwhat kind of data it is how many\nnumerical values are there what kind of\ndata types are there inside your data\nis it a csv file or not so on so you\nhave to figure out a lot\nof things while data exploration and\nafter that you can\nfigure out how to clean your data by\ncleaning i mean\nyou have to figure out the redundancies\nthat might hinder your model so for that\nyou have to check for\nnull values you have to check for\nmissing values and then you have to\nfigure out what kind of\ncolumns will be actually better if you\nput them inside your model\nand what are the redundant variables\nlike what kind of columns that you can\nactually remove and will not make a\ndifference in your mod\nso that covers the data cleaning part\nand then there is modeling where you\nhave to model your\nor you have to select your predictive\nmodel guys so\nthere are a lot of models that you can\ngo for but in this session i'm going to\nuse the linear regression model because\nit's the very simple or the basic one\nso that the beginners also will be able\nto learn it properly\nafter modeling you have to check for the\nevaluation or you have to check for the\naccuracy you know how your model is\nactually performing\nso let's talk about these steps in a\nlittle more detailed way\nso we'll talk about data exploration\nfirst of all as i've already told you\ndata exploration is\ngathering your data and then taking a\nlook at your data\nin a perspective that will clear a lot\nof things for example you will be able\nto see\nthe number of columns number of rows you\nwill have\na description of all the data types what\nkind of variables are there you will\nhave the mean values the average values\nminimum values\nand you can also check for unique values\nin your columns as well\nso this all comes in data exploration\nand after this\nthe second step is data cleaning and\ni've already told you guys data cleaning\nis basically getting rid of\nredundancies in your data which includes\nthe missing values which may hinder\nand you have to make sure that your\nmodel is not going to cause overfitting\nor underfitting\ndue to the noise and noise is basically\nirrelevant data that\nmay be in the form of null values so you\nhave to make sure you get rid of them or\nreplace them with average values in the\ncolumn\nand then there is redundancies like\noutliers which are not necessarily\nrequired in your model so you can remove\nthem as well so this is all about data\ncleaning\nand then we have the third step which is\nmodeling so for data modeling first of\nall you have to understand the\nrelationship between the variables in\nyour model so that\nyou will figure out what kind of model\nyou are going to go for\nso for example if let's say if you have\na target variable in our case which will\nbe a price of\ncertain goods so let's say you have to\nfigure out the relationship between\nvariables so if you're going for linear\nregression you have to make sure\nthe relationship is continuous and let's\nsay if you are\ngoing for logistic regression it is\nimportant that you go for\ncontinuous variables the target variable\nalthough has to be\ndichotomous or you know what you call it\ncategorical which is like let's say\nif i'm trying to predict something using\nthe logistic regression the answer would\nprobably be yes\nor no will be 1 or 0 something like that\nbut in case of linear regression we have\nto make sure that there is some\ncontinuous relationship between the\nvariables which is my target variable\nand my independent variables taking a\nlook at the fourth part\nor the fourth step and the final step is\nperformance analysis\nso after you're done making a model so\nyou have to perform certain analysis\nwhich is you know checking the accuracy\nof the model\nand making sure that it's above 70. i\nmean if you are a beginner\nand if you are trying to make your first\nprediction model anything above\n70 accuracy score is very good guys\nbut i would suggest that if you are\nworking on a good model\nand if you want your model to be good\nthe accuracy should be ranging around\n0.9 which is like more than 90\nand if you get it the first time it's\nwell and good\nbut it surely depends on your data and\nthe kind of model selection that you do\nso let's take a look at the next topic\nin our session guys so this is basically\nwhere i'm going to perform predictive\nanalysis using python on a data set\nso i have a problem statement in which i\nhave a data set which has\ncertain values or certain variables\nwhich has columns like\nyou know how many bedrooms does our\nhouse have and what kind of\nsquare feet it is uh grabbing and all\nthese things that i'll show you in the\ndata and\nusing that data i am going to predict\nthe house of a price\nso let's take it up to jupiter notebook\nguys and i'll show you what i'm going to\ndo over there\nso i have a jupyter notebook over here\nguys and if you are not familiar with\njupyter notebook guys\ni suggest you to check out our tutorial\non youtube we have a\njupyter notebook tutorial you will be\nable to learn it properly i mean there's\nnot really so much to learn in jupiter\nnetwork it's quite easy that is why i'm\nusing also\nand we have a cheat sheet as well so you\ncan go for that so first of all i'm\ngoing to import some\ndependencies so for the first step that\nis\ndata exploration i have to get the data\nso for that i'm going to use the\npandas library and i'll import a few\nother libraries as well\nlike i'm going to use the c bond to\ncheck the relationship between the\nvariables\nbasically for eda exploratory data\nanalysis\nand if you guys don't know what eda is i\nsuggest you to check out another\ntutorial\nwhich is exploratory data analysis that\nwe have on our youtube channel\nand then i'm going to import numpy as\nwell just in case\nall right and you can see guys i have to\njust press\nshift and enter and this is why i'm\nusing a jupyter notebook because\nthe implementation is very easy and i\ncan segregate my\ndata or the code in different cells so\ni'm importing this saw and i can just\nmake it okay i'll make it a little\nbigger so that it's visible to you\neveryone\nwhat i can do is i can comment our part\nlet's say\ninstalling\ndependencies\nand it is in a separate cell so that\nmakes it\nquite descriptive when you're coding and\nwhen you are trying to figure out what's\nwrong in your code it helps actually\nso after this what you have to do is\ni'll check i have to import the data for\nthat i'm going to use the read csv\nmodule which is basically going to go to\nthe file and read my data guys\nthe name of the file is house.csv\nwe have a truncated error all right so\nguys i have to\nshow you something so usually when you\ndo this you when you copy the file\nlocation you get that\nunicode error but let's see if i\nchange these backslashes to forward\nblack backslashes\nwhat happens do i still get the error or\nnot\nokay we have a all right so i was doing\nsomething over here\nso this is one exercise for you guys\nlike earlier when i was\nusing the backward backslashes i was\ngetting a unicode error but when i\nchange it to the forward backslashes\ni'm not getting that error so this is\none question for you guys tell me why\nyou think it happened\nin the comment sections below now moving\non i'll take the first look at my data\nguys so i'll just\nuse the head method to get my first data\nso these are the first five rows in my\ndata guys so we i have id\nwe have date the price is there bedrooms\nwe have bathrooms square feet living\nand square feet lot we have floors as\nwell waterfront is\nzero okay it has to be zero and one i\nguess\nthere is view then grade square feet\nabove so these are the\ncolumns that i have inside my data guys\nso i'll check the last five rows as well\nfor that i'm using the tail method\nso as you can see you can get the first\nlook of your data using the data dot\nhead and data dot tail method\nafter that i check the\ncolumns of my data and let's check the\nshape as well guys\nso that we'll know what we're dealing\nwith okay it's not callable\nall right so we have 21 613 entries with\n21 columns\nokay it's a quite big data set and let\nme tell you guys this is\none data set that i found on kaggle and\nit's very easy to found the house data\nset and i am using this example of house\ndata set because\nit's very common and to find this data\nset is very easy you go on to kegel\nand you just look for house prediction\ndata sets\nand it will show you a lot of data sites\nthat you can download there from\nokay so you can find the data side on\nkaggle guys\nnow we have checked the shape as well\nokay i'll use one more\nmethod that is data or describe all\nright this callable all right\nso we have all these numerical values\nand\nusing the describe method we can get the\n50 minimum\nmaximum and the standard deviation we\ncan get the mean value and the count as\nwell\nso let's say for bedrooms the mean value\nis three uh the most common\nentry in the bedroom section is\na three bedroom house and then for\nbathrooms also is a two bathroom house\nsquare feet is almost two zero seven\nnine square feet and then for maximum\nvalues we have even a 33\nbedroom house as well and we have a\nhouse with eight bathrooms\nand the square feet is thirteen thousand\nfive forty\nall right so minimum value is we have a\nzero bedroom house okay\nthat's gonna be something else and\nsquare feet two ninety\nso this this is how you use the describe\nmethod and\nthis is the first step guys i'm trying\nto do the data exploration\nnow after this i think i'm pretty sure\nabout what kind of data i'm dealing with\nnow what i'm going to do i'm going to\nmove on to the next step that is\nchecking for the\nrelationship between these variables so\nfor that i'm going to use the data\nvisualization\nand i'm going to use a few i'm going to\nuse a few plot points\nusing the cbon library and if you don't\nknow about\nc bond we have a youtube uh tutorial on\ncbon library as well so you can find out\ndifferent\nkinds of plots that you can use for data\nvisualization\nand data visualization is nothing but\nit's a process where you can visualize\nyour data\nand you can try to figure out the\nrelationship between the variables\nbefore that i want to check for null\nvalues or missing values\nbecause i don't want to get any\nhindrance in my\ndata set where i'm modeling so first of\nall you have to do\ncheck for null values\nand let's get a sum as well so we have\nzero almost okay so we have no null\nvalues in this data set\nso usually if you find a null value and\nif it's a big data set\nand let's say if all these values are\nlet's say 2 000 and if you have 10\nmissing values you can just remove those\n10 values but if there are more null\nvalues\nit's just you to replace them with the\nmean value\nand to find out the mean value you can\njust go over here let's say if you have\nuh let's say if you're checking for\nbedrooms how many null values are there\nand let's say\nthere are 500 out of 21 000. so you can\njust uh replace\nthe zero with this value which is three\nand similarly for any other column you\ncan do the same using the mean value\nso since there are no null values inside\nthis data set because it's a very\nuh clean data set that i downloaded it\nfrom kaggle so we're gonna move on to\nthe next\nstep which is visualization\nand mind you guys this is the step in my\ndata exploration part\nand the data cleaning part not the other\nsteps that we use for predictive\nanalysis\nall right so i have no null values but\nthere are a few redundancies that i want\nto get rid of\ni'll talk about that later guys first of\nall i'm gonna use\na relation plot x i'll use\nokay so i want to check or my basic\naim is to predict the price of the house\nall right\nso for x i'll just take\nprice and let's check the relationship\nbetween these variables so i'll check\nfor bedroom\nall right kind is equal to\nokay we'll not use kind data is equal to\ndata okay\nall right so i think\nwe can like almost there are so many i\nmean\nso this is one uh relationship that i'm\ngetting over here\nprice is not very clear but we are\ngetting the relationship of the bedrooms\nor the most common bedroom so which is\naround\nover here that is zero to five\nand similarly i can check for other\nvariables as well like bathrooms\nsee guys so the price is actually\nincreasing with the number of bathrooms\nbut it's not necessarily uh same for\neverything\nso there has to be some other\ndependencies as well because as you can\nsee since the bathroom surprising price\nis not actually\nrising that much okay i'll just copy\nthis\nfor bedrooms\nthe price is actually increasing pretty\nmuch with each\nbedroom i mean not really if\nwe take a look at 10 bedrooms also the\nprice is pretty much the same\nso this is not one decisive factor i can\nthink of for this\nall right so we'll check for some other\nas well so we'll check for square read\nsquare feet living\nso this is one linear relationship that\ni'm seeing over here\nso with each square feet rising\nmost of the prices actually in this area\nonly\nlike from 0 to 400 000 or 40 million\nactually\nbut we can see that it's a linear\nrelationship with each increasing um\nsquare\nfeet the price is actually rising so\nthis is one thing that has to be there\nin\ninside our train set i'll tell you what\na train set actually is\nthen there is floor as well we can check\nfor floors\nall right okay so floors is actually a\npretty\ndescriptive over here so for most of the\nvalues are in the two floors area and\nthen we can check for waterfront as well\nokay we can do one thing i'll tell you\none trick\nso we'll add the hue over here\nthis is going to be water front\nso with the houses which actually has a\nwaterfront are in oranges\nand the other ones are in blue so you\ncan see\nthe relationship between them and\nsimilarly i can use\nother okay so let's say latitude and\nlongitude so\nyou can figure out the relationship\nbetween the variables using uh the\nvisualization so for me\ni think in this data set to get the\nprice out\nwe're gonna have to use bedrooms\nbathroom there has to be square feet\na lot of square feet has to be there\nfloors also we can\nget and then what view front view we'll\nuse\nsquare feet how we have to use and your\nbuild and you're renovated we can leave\nit out from the train set\nand zip code also we don't actually need\nlatitude and longitude are also not\ndecisive in\nprediction because we can use it for uh\nvisualization and we can actually get\nthe picture over there and square feet\nliving is actually important so\nthese are the redundancies that i was\ntalking about inside your model\nso now we'll move on to the modeling\npart guys\nso what i'll do now is i'll import a few\ndependencies guys\nso from sk learn so first of all i have\nto import\nthe linear regression from linear models\ni'm going to import\nlinear regression all right so i'll\nimport the\nmodel selection import\ndata split all right so first thing that\ni have to do is i have to segregate my\ndata into a training set and a\ntest set so i'll do one thing guys\nright so i'll get my data in this\ncell\nso two things that i don't actually need\ninside my data are date because uh\ni'll get the training data or i'll write\nit as\ntrain so which is going to be\ndata and i'm going to drop a few columns\nso i'll have\nto drop so i have to drop a\nfew columns so first of all i have to\ndrop price because it cannot be in my\ntraining set since i'm gonna predict it\nand then there has to be id we don't\nactually need it\nand then i'm going to drop date as well\ndoes not really\nprove a lot of things over here so for\nnow i'll just remove all these columns\nand for our test set or the dependent\nvariable let's say\ni'm going to take the variable as a\ntest let's say and for this i'm going to\nuse\ndata dot or we need actually just one\ncolumn\nthat is price right method objects\nis not subscriptable i'm sorry i made a\nsyntax error over here guys\ni have to add the axis as well\nnow it's fine guys so now what i will do\nis i'll use\ni'm going to segregate my data into x\ntrain\nx test y train\nand y test and now i'm going to use the\ntrain test split method so first we have\ntrain then we have test\nwe have test\nsize which is let's say 0.3\nand we have the random state is equal to\nlet's say 2 right so we have\nmade our x train and extend method now\ni'll use one variable let's say\nour egr regressor and now i'm going to\ncall my linear regression\nmodel it's made guys so now i'm going to\nuse the\nfit method to fit my xtrain and x y\ntrain\ndata guys the training data have to fit\nright we have no errors here guys\nafter this i can just uh okay i'll take\none variable let's say predict\nand gr dot\npredict x\ntest and y test\nall right wait a second guys i'm sorry\nso now the modeling part is done guys so\ni'll explain what i've done over here\ni took the linear model which is linear\nregression\nand then for segregating my data into\ntraining and testing set i'm using the\ntrain test split\nbefore that i segregated the data for my\nmodel inside which i'm using the\ntraining\nset which has all the values from the\ndata set except price\nid and date so i have removed these\nthree columns because i thought these\nare redundant for my model right now\nand the variable that i'm going to\npredict over here is\nthe price so i'm taking that alone so\nafter that i use the train test split\nmethod to actually\nseparate the data into training and test\nset\nand then i call the linear regression\nmodel over here\nusing the regression model i'm fitting\nthe training data\nand after that i am using it to predict\nthe value\nso now comes the part where we have to\ncheck the efficiency of the model\nso for regression models it is very easy\nguys\nyou can just check the score for this\nyou have to\nwrite a few values x test and y test\nand we have the accuracy of 0.70 which\nis\nnot bad guys if you're using the model\nor the data set this big it is quite\npredictable\nget this kind of accuracy but you can do\nsomething else to improve the\naccuracy i mean you can look at the data\nand remove all the values that you\nfind will help you into improving your\naccuracy\nlike you can remove latitude longitude\nyou can remove zip code\nyou're renovated your built that you can\nactually\nremove water front and view as well or\nkeep only a few values that you actually\nneed which is\nbedrooms bathrooms i think and\neverything related to square feet\nthat if you keep in your training set\nthen it's going to be a\nhigher accuracy for you guys all right\nso now that we are done with the section\nguys i want to give you a\nexercise sort of which you can do for\npracticing this\nso i have used the linear regression\nmodel over here so i want you to do one\nthing guys\ncheck out other classifiers and\nregressive models that you can use to\npredict the value i mean we have a\ntutorial on\nall of them on our youtube channel and\nsee if you can use the same data to make\na\nprediction model using other classifiers\nlike a random forest classifier\nthen we have a decision tree then you\ncan use the logistic regression\nfor this as well i mean if you have\ncontinuous data\nthen you can go for linear regression\nbut if you find a categorical data\nlet's say we have waterfront or not so\nyou can check for that as well\nso now that we are done with the session\nguys don't forget to subscribe to\nedureka for more exciting
