  "text": "today we're going to be talking about ubiquitous \ncomputing um people a lot of people also call it  \nubicomp so i'm going to be using the phrase \nubicomp as well as ubiquitous computing so  \nwhenever you hear me say you become that's just a \ncompression of ebooks ubiquitous computing because  \nas you can tell it's quite hard to say ubiquitous \na lot so that's why people say you become  \nokay so you become so is this the \nidea of computers being everywhere  \nor is it is it more than that there's a kind of \nvision associated with ub comp which is all about  \ni guess sort of disappearing of computers or at \nleast the idea of computers not being kind of  \nvisible to us not necessarily that we can't see \nthem but they're effectively invisible in our  \nkind of practices so when we kind of go and do \nstuff in the world we're interact interacting  \nwith and using computing technologies all the \ntime but the ways in which we're doing it we're  \nnot really focusing on on the on the technology \nitself and it's quite in contrast to kind of how  \npeople talk about people say using mobile phones \nand just being completely focused on the phone  \nand so on so the idea of the vision \nof ubicomp is obvious of this kind of  \nworld of um seamless interactions with technology \nthat just simply uh help us get stuff done\none of the founders of ubiquitous computing um \nor ubicomp as well now call it was mark weiser  \nand he talked particularly about calm computing so \nthis idea that there's not this kind of frenetic  \nactivity interacting with all these devices \nand managing all this kind of digital stuff  \nrather i'm just simply able to do things in life \nin a kind of calm way and it just so happens that  \ni use technology to get those things done way \nback in the midst of time in the early days of  \ncomputer file we did something called a video \ncalled what is a computer i think it was with  \nprofessor tom rodden and we were talking about \nthe ideas of computers being in credit cards and  \ncomputers being in all sorts of places that you \ndon't even realize things like the internet of  \nthings i suppose we're talking about here but it's \nnot just as you say that it's also the fact that  \nour interaction with them is not something that \nwe even necessarily consider is that is that about  \nright well the kind of the idea of ubicomp turns \non is that um it's embedded into everyday life  \nso in much the same way that we don't really think \nnecessarily about some of the infrastructures in  \nour house that kind of enable our house to go to \nwork properly so i mean an example would be like  \nsomething like the heating perhaps a lot of time \nyou don't think about the heating but as soon as  \nit breaks down it suddenly becomes manifest \nand kind of very much visible even though  \nmost of the time you're not really you know just \nkind of it just sort of works most of the time  \none of the ways to understand you become where \nit comes from is to understand that mark wiser  \nwas um reacting against what was very popular at \nthe time so he developed ubicomp in the late 80s  \nand early 90s virtual reality was a big deal at \nthe time it was a kind of first wave of vr vr is  \ndoing this thing where we're taking people into \nthe machine in a kind of very absorbing way and  \nif you've been around anyone using a vr \nheadset you'll know that it's very difficult to  \ncommunicate with them and to have any kind \nof shared experience and so ubicomp was about  \ntaking the computing and putting it into the world \nembedding it into everything to avoid that problem  \nof being absorbed into the machine so it's very \nmuch kind of of the view that technology should  \nlet us get the things done that we need to and not \nget in the way and so vr is very much the opposite  \nthat where the technology becomes the focus of \nattention so it must be seen in the context that  \nhistorical context the reaction against um against \nvr really was mark weiser at somewhere like mit  \nor or one of these places berkeley or something \nso mark weiser was uh kind of one of the it's  \nbest known basically as someone who was at xerox \npark now park is palo alto research center so  \nxerox park was a division of xerox to the \nphotocopier company who are still around park was  \nvery famous for establishing some of the core uh \ncomponents i guess for elements of computing which  \nare all very familiar with now park developed what \nlooks like one of the first pcs effectively called  \nthe xerox alto you'll see it kind of looks like a \ndesktop computer it's got a keyboard got a mouse  \nit's a kind of well-known story that steve \njobs went to park and had a look around  \nand saw the alto and interface and took a \nbunch of things from it and implemented it into  \napple's range of machines and kind of famous \nfor doing so but you know you saw something  \nthat seemed like it kind of worked really \nwell and as any sensible person should do  \nuh take that and use it in some kind of way so \nthe history of um xerox park is really important  \nbecause of because of that aspect i mean there's \nother aspects of the alto which are important like  \nnetworking and so on crucially during the kind of \nlate 80s and early 90s sort of bringing us up to  \nmark wise's time xerox park was developing a \nload of different sorts of technologies around  \nthings like improvements in sort of networking \nmobility so sort of reducing sizes of things  \nmaking devices more mobile um improving kind of \ntheir networking capabilities um dealing with  \nissues around power those sorts of things they \nwere developing all these different technologies  \nand one of the issues was that mark weiser \nsaw was that there was no coherent vision of  \nall these different technologies and how \nthey might fit together and he had this  \num this way of thinking which brought them \ntogether and that's what birthed this idea  \nof ubi comp mark weiss's vision was to take uh or \nthe ubcom vision was to take all these different  \ndisparate bits of technology that were being \ndeveloped like you know wi-fi networking and  \nbetter power management and more powerful \ncomputing and display technologies and all these  \nsorts of things and bring them together into this \nvision of ubiquitous computing which was about  \nyou know computing being everywhere um with you \non your old times uh in the woodwork so to speak  \nas he put it um embedded into buildings embedded \ninto you know all sorts of places vehicles those  \nsorts of things in a way it's kind of partly like \nthe world well elements of it are kind of a bit  \nlike the world we're living in now in the sense \nof you know cars have extremely sophisticated  \nmanagement systems some cars are connected \nto the internet all times we have internet  \nof things technologies in our homes so smart \nbulbs smart heating systems whatever it might be  \nwe also have devices we carry around um with \nus you know all in all places so there's many  \nways in which the uh vision that he created of \nubicomp actually is kind of with us today today  \ncertain elements of it so it's although at the \ntime it was massive yes worth emphasizing how  \nhow ambitious it was as a vision at the time \ngiven that you know talking about the late 80s um  \nthere's no sense in which everyone had a desktop \npc at that point necessarily at all so it's a very  \nvery different world i think that's if anyone's \nyou know people who are watching us have to  \nreally understand if they weren't around then they \nhave to understand how much of a different world  \nit was and um and how much of a kind of visionary \nperson he needs to be to bring the stuff together  \nthere's another aspect that's important about \nbringing all those technologies together and that  \nwas a kind of to do with the relationship between \npark itself and xerox now as with any and there's  \na story about the demise of the corporate um \nresearch lab which we can probably talk about in  \nanother video but um as with any kind of corporate \nresearch lab or any kind of facility like this he  \nneeds to justify his existence to um to xerox and \none way to justify the development of these very  \ninteresting technologies was to say well actually \npart of a bigger vision and the vision was ubicomp  \nand so that so not just it wasn't just that it \nhad a purely had a function in terms of the kind  \nof computer science elements but also this kind of \num element of of how do you justify this work it  \nactually occurring even at all so i think you know \nhe's a really important figure because he brings  \ntogether all these things and then obviously that \nleads to this idea of internet of things which is  \nnowhere near as sophisticated in its vision \nas mark wise's original but there's no way  \nit would really exist without the idea of ubicomp \nif you want to read a core text about you become  \nyou can read his really famous 1991 scientific \namerican article called the computer for the 21st  \ncentury it's not a hugely technical bit of writing \nso i'd encourage everyone to go and have a look at  \nit it kind of lays out this vision the ubicomp \nvision very clearly about this world um in which  \nwe live in this kind of ubicomp world all these \ndifferent sense technologies different bits of  \ncomputing embedded into everything also you know \ngoes through all the different challenges that  \nare associated with this because we could talk at \nlength about the some of the issues that it brings  \nup so if we're doing ubiquitous computing \nwe suddenly have issues around things like  \nas mentioned already power becomes a real problem \nhow do you power all these devices sensors  \nhow do you collect sensor data and then make \nsense of it at all because there's all this  \nstuff flying around in terms of the data you're \ncollecting how do you network stuff how do you  \nensure continuous provision of networking services \nthese are all major problems still now obviously  \nhow do you get the adequate data science stuff to \ndo the inference to make sure you understand the  \ndata you're getting back and then act on it how \ndo you determine things like context these are  \nreally critical problems and what the kind of \ninteraction techniques that you need to build  \nto enable people to actually interact with these \num always on always with you type devices or  \ndevices that are embedded into non-standard \nthings like you know you're not expecting  \nthe wall to have a computer embedded into it \nwhat's the form of interaction that you might  \nuh need to enable someone to interact with a wall \nin an appropriate way that's not a trivial thing  \nto work out i mean it took a long time just to get \nto you know this sort of thing right um many many  \ndifferent prototypes were made to get to the mouse \nthe surprising amount of work in something we now  \ntake for granted did mark weiser see his vision \nfulfilled what happened mark wise unfortunately  \ndied in 1999 so he died quite young um and uh you \nknow so so he he would have seen the some of the  \nfruits of what he'd created in terms of vision um \ni guess in terms of things like miniaturization  \nand increased networking you know improvements in \nthat technology and all those sorts of things but  \nbut i really think um you know he'll be missing \nout on the internet of things that we see now and  \nthere's a very direct line between that as i said \nbetween that and you become so i think there was a  \nlot more to come basically that that he never saw \nunfortunately i i would argue here that the way  \nthat the internet of things has developed uh in \na kind of ramshackle away from various different  \nmanufactures is far from his vision by from what \ni understand how do you go about testing a system  \nlike this when you're coming up with it from \nnowhere and these aren't kind of devices you  \ncan ship off to somebody to have a play with how \ndo you go about making sure it does stuff that  \nyou wanted to do when they were building these \ndifferent devices they talked about building  \ntechnologies at different scales they had a \nvery small scale post-it note scale through  \nto a kind of ipad size scale through to a kind of \nwhiteboard size scale and they kind of experiment  \nwith different technologies have been involved \nin building those things and making them work  \num in order to test them um they actually use \nthemselves in their own work they sort of ate  \ntheir own dog food so to speak in working with \nthem they understood more about what it meant to  \nlive in this way with those technologies so that \nway in which they test it out themselves was very  \nvery important for um the kind of ubicomp vision \nand establishing the ubicomp vision for for others  \num and you know making it um seem like it's taken \nseriously which is we're so serious about this  \ntechnology we're just going to use it ourselves \nand i think at the time that wasn't necessarily  \nreally one of those kind of practices that people \nwould generally engage in they'll generally be  \num perhaps engaging users other people in in \ntrials for a specific short amount of time  \nand measuring various facets of of those of those \ntrials those experiments drawing very badly here  \nand so on so you'd have two sets of pulses \none delayed from the other it's what we call  \nquadrature encoding we can actually derive \nfrom that 1990 something or other this was  \nthis big crunch coming up that we're \ngoing to run out of ip addresses any\n[MANUAL
