  "text": "hey there welcome back today we're\ntalking on a topic that's crucial for\nall of us that care about Digital Data\nI'm talking about the difference between\ncloud storage and online backup if\nyou're thinking aren't they basically\nthe same thing the answer is well not\nquite stick around as I go into detail\nso you know which is the best place for\nyour data I'll also share which one I'd\npersonally choose so stick around until\nthe end I'll reveal all of my\nsecrets all right first let's address\nthe elephant in the room what exactly is\nthe cloud you've probably heard this\nterm a lot more so since we all began\nworking remotely but what does it\nactually mean it's basically like using\nsomeone else's computer when you upload\na file to the cloud you're actually\nstashing it on a remote server owned and\nrun by companies such as Google Amazon\nor Microsoft think of it like renting a\nstorage unit for your clutter only\ninstead of driving over to get your\nstuff you can access your data as long\nas you have an internet connection easy\npeasy okay so now we know what the cloud\nis let's look at how it compares to\nonline backup now this isn't like one of\nyour traditional battles where I compare\ntwo of the same type of product you see\nalthough they're similar cloud storage\nand online backup do something a little\ndifferent than the other and let me let\nme put it like this cloud storage is\nlike a digital closet you decide what\ngoes in how it's organized and you can\neasily take things out when you want to\nonline backup on the other hand is like\na time machine for your device it\nautomatically saves everything on your\ndevice it then creates creates a copy\nthat you can retrieve if you ever need\nto recover from data loss and what's\nuseful about it is you can also choose\nto run backups continuously or at a date\nand time that suits you still with me\ngood let's dive a little bit deeper\nshall we cloud storage services are all\nabout accessibility and in most cases\ncollaboration let's look at some of the\nmain features you can expect to get when\nsignning up for one of our cloud storage\nservices that we frequently recommend\nhere on the channel well first is file\nsyncing that means you can access files\nyou upload to the cloud on multiple\ndevices I'm talking desktop cell phone\ntablet this is great if you have other\nusers on your account or if you need to\nquickly access document while on the\nmove and you always want to ensure you\nhave the most recent change of that file\non all of your devices so if you make a\nchange at the office the file gets\nsynced to the cloud gets sync to your\nother devices you leave the office you\ncome home you can work on that same\ndocument the state you've left it at the\noffice sharing is caring with cloud\nstorage as modern Services make it\neasier for you to essentially send files\nto others you can do it in just a few\nclicks and also control how the\nrecipient or recipients can interact\nwith a file like being able to view or\nedit the files and as examples another\nuseful feature for desktop users is\nselective storage you can basically get\nto choose which files you upload and\nsync to your computer and which files\nyou only store locally it's like packing\nfor a trip you decide what to take or\nleave at home I should note that\nselective sync isn't available with\nevery single cloud storage service but\nit is a pretty common feature of these\ndays and if you make changes to a file\nwhich you wish you didn't there's a\nfeature for that too I'm talking about\nversion history it's a feature that lets\nyou go back to an older version of a\nfile and make things return to how you\nbasically want them if there is one\nthing about cloud storage that brings\nthe cloudwords team truly together it's\ncollaboration tools most cloud storage\nServices have features built in that let\nyou work with others in real time no\nmatter where you are sitting you can\nleave notes with with feedback make\nsuggestions and get work done as a team\nI love that about cloud storage and it\nreally makes our team tick before we\nmove on I can already hear you asking\nbut what about privacy and security well\nthe most popular cloud storage Services\nhave topnotch security so the risk of\nsomething happening to your data is\npretty low and limited privacy on the\nother hand is a little bit of a mixed\nbag some like sync.com put your privacy\nfirst and ensure only you get to choose\nwho accesses your data others like\nGoogle don't place a high premium on\nyour personal data privacy and love\nselling your data on the highest bidder\nso when might you choose cloud storage\nworking on projects is a good use case\nor anytime you need to access and work\nwith files from more than one device\nfinally when you want to share files\ncloud storage is the absolute way go for\nyou if you want to prevent losing all\nyour data including system settings and\napps that's where online backup comes in\ndata loss can come from many sources it\nmight be caused by a hard drive crashing\nor some run running off with your device\nor maybe a car runs over your mobile\ndevice anything can happen to your data\nand hey it could happen without online\nbackup your data is likely Gone Forever\nhere are some of the features it offers\nthe first one is automatic backup these\nare a real data saver because you can\nprogram your backup software to do its\nthing at specific times this removes the\nworry of always needing to remember to\ndo manual backup and think of it as your\npersonal system that's always making\nsure your data is safe next up on the\nfeature list is\ncomplete system backup it's here you'll\nsee a noticeable difference compared to\ncloud storage you see unlike cloud\nstorage online backup saves everything\non your device\nthat includes apps system settings and\nyour OS file so if you need to factor or\nreset your device you can restore your\nexact set system settings with its\nbackup and running obviously it depends\non the online backup service now there\nare cloud backup services that include\nbacking up of system files some exclude\nsystem files specifically there are\ndifferent flavors of it so to speak\nonline backup has its own type of\nversion history as well for example\nlet's say you want to restore your data\nback to a specific point in time you can\ndo this with online backup this is\nuseful if you accidentally delete apps\nor files you wish you really hadn't have\nyou ever heard of a term called bare\nmetal restore well if you haven't don't\nworry it's not some type of experimental\nmusic only found in underground parties\nit's actually a cool feature that lets\nyou restore your system to a brand new\ndevice it's like upgrading without\nhaving to start from scratch and\nmost of these bare metal restore\nfeatures are offered by business cloud\nbackup services but more and more\nconsumer services offer these two as\nthey see more people really needing to\nrestore their files the last core\nfeature I want to share with you is\narchiving some online backup Services\nlet you store files even if you no\nlonger have them on your device for\nexample if you have an old video project\nthat's taking up space move it over to\nthe archive who doesn't want their own\npersonal digital adding right security\nand privacy with online backup providers\nare very similar to Cloud Storage\nsecurity at the most reputable Services\nis as good as it gets on the other hand\nprivacy policies are in your corner or\nserve the provider's needs take iDrive\nit has excellent privacy with the option\nto enable private encryption when you\nsign up crash plan on the other hand\nisn't as good with privacy and does not\nhave zero knowledge encryption that's a\nbummer another thing to consider with\nonline backup is that it tends to be\nslower than cloud storage particularly\nwith uploads if the total size is large\nenough it could take hours or even days\nwith cloud storage uploads and downloads\noften happen in minutes also online\nbackup with a few exceptions isn't meant\nfor file sharing or collaboration it's\nmore like a digital security blanket for\nyour data in case disaster happens so\nwhen do you choose online backup I'd say\nwhen you have data you don't want to\nlose or if you're faced with ransomware\nor device failures and let's face it\nthese are all valid concerns and real\npossibilities especially for businesses\nit can cost them millions or even cause\nbankruptcy in some cases now I hear some\nof you asking can I just use both yeah\nyeah sure you can in fact I and other\nTech experts recommend using both cloud\nstorage and online backup for maximum\nprotection and data flexibility there's\nalso the 3 to1 backup rule which I've\nexplained here in this channel before\nand also on cloudwords nnet so I also\nrecommend a physical backup somewhere\nelse not only relying on the cloud yes\nthat's me saying having a Channel about\ncloud storage and a website about cloud\nbackup you also need another copy of\nyour files physically on another hard\ndrive that's the best think of it like\nthis cloud storage is is your everyday\nbag it has the items you you use\nregularly and it lets you access them\nquickly online backup on the other hand\nit's like an insurance policy it's there\nif you need it but you really hope you\nyou never really have to use it but\ntrust me the day will come you will have\nto use it a quick note on the cost of\nservices it's a tricky one because how\nmuch service will cost highly depends on\nhow much storage you need and generally\nthough cloud storage is cheaper than\nonline backup if you're only working\nwith a with small amounts of data on the\nother hand online backup can provide\nmore bang for your buck for large data\nsets and I'll drop a link in the\ndescription to some of my favorite\noptions so you can compare prices and\neventually make a decision for what's\nthe best for your needs and obviously if\nyou're like a business then things tend\nto get a little bit more pricier because\nyou have other uh security factors and\nother things um that you need to\nconsider now I know we've covered a lot\nof ground here but um here's the thing\nwhether you choose cloud storage online\nbackup or both you're already ahead of\nthe game you're taking steps to protect\nyour digital life and that's a very\nsmart move remember the best option is\nthe one that fits your specific needs do\nyou often collaborate on projects then\ncloud storage is your best bet don't\nworry about it if you worry about losing\nall your data then go with an online\nbackup provider and also remember that\nyou can and probably should use them\nboth for the best protection and\naccessibility what's your next move well\nI advise taking note of what type of\ndata you want to back up and how you\nwould like to interact with that data\nthen go sign up for an account and try\nthem out yourself most of them have free\nservice plans available or free trials\nlet me know in the comments what you go\nfor I'm super interested to hear your\nthoughts and comments and if you found\nthis video helpful please as always hit\nthe like button subscribe this will help\nthe channel and also let me know what\nother content you'd like to see I'm\nlooking forward to reading your thoughts\nand ideas and see you in my next video\nbye-bye\n",
