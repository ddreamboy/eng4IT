  "text": "[Music]\n[Music]\nso let's just uh dive right into it\nbecause in some sense uh my talks\nalready been introduced uh previously\nso you've already heard this term\nubiquitous Computing ubic comp and I I\nwant to just fill in some details from\nwhat you heard earlier so uh yes this is\nanother picture of Mark Weiser and yes\nthis is the article that you've already\nbeen told you should read um or if you\nwant to know about it and the thing was\nis that I was part of this team and and\nand and fairly involved in this project\nand I I want to go into a little bit\nmore detail by way of background because\nit's um it's not trivial uh and there's\nsome interesting things that happen here\nso I want to try and get two key words\nand Concepts out about what ous\nComputing is about and it's it's about\nbasically how do you make things\ntransparent how do you make computation\nor the benefits of computation which is\na much better way to say it how do you\nmake the benefits of\ncomputation available everywhere where\nit's\nrelevant while keeping it transparent to\nthe user and so it's sort of like this\nthing where I have to cross this water\nfrom this uh Shore to the other Shore\nand how do I get there in a way that's\nuh makes sense now in the old days you\njust swam but there's sharks in the\nwater and you you you run the risk of\ngetting um eaten so you introduce some\ntechnology and so the engineering\napproach is you build a motorboat that\npollutes and so on so forth and it costs\na bunch of money and uh you go across\nthat way in some sense the purpose of\nubiquitous\ncomputing in this metaphor would be that\nyou build a\nbridge hence you get around from Island\nto island or from Shore to Shore exactly\nthe same way you get around on any one\nof those Shores that is you use the same\nskills you've used through a lifetime of\nliving in the everyday world you walk\nnow it's not that you can't see the\nbridge the bridge is there and that's\npart of the Aesthetics of design as well\nas the functionality of design so you\nwalk across the bridge so it's not that\nyou can't see the bridge transparency of\ntechnology is sort of like this the\ndining room table because it belongs in\nthe dining room is transparent to your\nfunctioning in the household however\nthat very same dining room if you put it\nin the toilet not in the toilet but in\nthe bathroom would be out of place\nlikewise if you put the toilet and\nremoved it from the bathroom and put it\ninto the dining room or the kitchen that\nwould sort of be noticed and and so it's\nnot about it being invisible it's just\nbeing appropriately placed in a way that\nintegrates into the workspace now what\nwe did at Park is we started to do\nexactly this was already described and\nMark's notion was that you had these\nthree form factors that you worked with\nbasically boards um uh slates which we\ncall pads and\ntabs and we typically talked about in\nyour office in your space you might have\none or two boards you might have two to\nfive slates and you might have up to\nfive to multiple tens of of of tabs the\nnotion was that each of these form\nfactors were going to come cheaper and\nin some sense you'd have as many tabs\naround as you might have Post-it\nnotes I'm going to you can see actually\nuh that's Mark at the one of the first\ngeneration live boards and uh and you\ncan see a slate you'd think it was a\nthis is photograph is from about uh 1993\num you can see a a slate there\neverything was networked the the the the\npads and the tabs were all um wirelessly\nnetworked and this is a closeup that's\nactually my hand from I did the\nIndustrial design on on on the of the\nthe basic specs for the uh for the tab\num and Fitz Richardson Smith the the the\ndetail design but the thing about it was\nis that there's a couple well there's a\ncouple things about it that that's\ninteresting that relates to what I'm\nabout to talk\nabout it looks like a PDA this\nphotograph is some 1993 so this is 3\nyears before the pal\npilot it's one year before the Simon\nwhich was the world's first\nsmartphone it's wireless it uses IR\nwhich meant it knew what room it was\nin\nand in one sense it's a wireless PDA\nthat you can carry around but was\nNetwork to everything else in in in the\nbuilding by the way they were absolutely\nuseless the minute you left the building\nthey had no light they had no internal\napps they were actually in the jargon of\nthe the day it ran X clients or sorry it\nran X servers because a server is a\nclient in today's\nParliament you could use it had a\nresista film touchscreen so you could\nuse your finger or you could use the\nstylus but what I want you to notice\nabout it and this is the part that I\ninsisted\non was notice how I'm holding it I'm\nholding it to one\nhand and the three buttons are Des\ndesigned around the end of the device so\nthat the same hand that's holding it the\nfingers wrap around and can be used to\noperate any of the buttons to get stayed\nmy background of music is no coincidence\nin terms of the what the design came up\nto it was shaped and the form was\nlargely determined by a trumpet Valves\nand likewise by being able to hold it\nand operate the buttons by the same hand\nthat holds it just like a trumpet which\nI used to play um you could actually\nhave seven buttons but you not only can\npush any one of them you can push them\nin seven combinations that you get by\ntrumpet the ne most important part was\nyou could hold it without even looking\nat it and work the buttons where it was\nnecessary and by the way after the fact\nI discovered there's a guy named\nLivermore who lived in the New England\nin around 1867 who made a six button\ndevice that had exactly that form factor\nwhich was the world's first Portable\ntypewriter and he kept it in his pocket\nand he would sit and take notes and\ndescribe in exactly the same way Thad\nStarner and the and cyborgs did so it\nwas all mechanical but he was actually\ntaking eyesee typing which is something\nnone of us can do with our smartphones\neven\ntoday\num what was important about this and why\nI wanted to do it that way is from the\nvery beginning before we built anything\nwas the notion was that it wasn't these\nthree islands a tab a slate and a on a\nboard they all had to work when they're\nalone but they were designed and\nconceived of that they joined together\nin different combinations generally\nbased on proximity and an oper and fun\nand and\nintent so the my model and I had a\nphotograph actually of Queen Elizabeth\nrather than Queen Victoria but this is\nthis shows it up better if you look at\nthe English Queen most of the formal\nphotographs have her doing two things in\nthe non-dominant hand holding this ball\nwith a cross on it which is called an\norb and the scepter in the other hand\nthis is the Regal pose and that was the\nmetaphor that we would talk about that\nthe tab when I was working on the live\nboard I would have the stylus as my\nscepter and I would have the park tab as\nmy orb so that when I came up and\nstarted writing I could check my notes\nand have secondary material here that I\ncould as as a secondary screen for\ncoaching while I wrote here and this\nsame pen that worked on the board I\ncould come and actually make notes on\nhere as well but likewise while holding\nI could do things like if I was was in a\nwindow and and anything like that I\ncould scroll up or scroll down or page\nup or page down by doing one or two keys\non either side so that the the buttons\nwhen I'm working on the live board the\nbuttons on the park tab actually\naffected the what I was doing on the\nboard not on the tab so that the the\npark tab became a peripheral to the\nboard and as I walked away it seamlessly\ndecoupled and became an autonomous\nentity whose Behavior changed as I as it\nbecame\nalone and again those R visions and\nthings that still haven't been realized\ndid we finish making all that stuff work\nat Park absolutely not a lot of things\nhappen but the main thing was from day\none that drove the physical architecture\nof the device and it's still probably\nthe only PDA that you can operate with\none hand the button functions the same\nhand that's holding\nit\nnow in terms of to be honest we didn't\nwork a lot because we were just trying\nto make this stuff work but in the early\nphases but we got stuff working when you\ncould work at the board and you'd work\nat the tab when it's by\nitself but unfortunately gods in the\ndetails and the most important detail is\nnot that state or this state not the\nstate of coupled versus solo but moving\nfrom one to the other because we live in\na dynamic world and if you've read my\nbook or heard me speak I tend I spent a\nyear or two ranting about the following\nis that just as when I see storyboards\nwhich are screen shots or screen\num um Pro sketches of screens connected\nby arrows I scream really\nloudly for the following reason that if\nyou don't have as much detail in your\nearly sketches in the arrows as you do\nin the things that the arrows connect\nyou probably don't deserve a\njob I'm overstating this but let's just\nsay you might want to rethink how you do\nyour\njob because it's all about the\nTransitions and if anybody says\nsomething like the iPhone is successful\nbecause of the touchcreen or the\ngraphics or the skin not at all the\nthing that it\ndid is it made the transitions the flow\nit's all about the flow and those of us\nwho think we're doing storyboards when\nwe put up thumbnails or screens and have\narrows have never worked in Hollywood\nand have never seen a\nstoryboard and if you study it Rochester\nfor example industrial design you will\ntake a multi-week course and doing\nnothing but drawing arrows and getting\nthe semantics of arrows right so you can\nget the vocabulary of the motion\ncaptured if you put a bunch of snapshots\nconnected by arrows to show the sequence\nand an engineer sees them that's what\nthey will build and it'll go snap snap\nsnap and when you say that's not how\nit's supposed to Flow It's supposed to\nbe tumbling supposed to do all these\nwonderful transitions you say you didn't\nspecify it it's not in the arrows I gave\nyou you I gave you what you asked for\nand if you didn't ask for it properly\nguess whose problem that\nis and they're\nright so this comes right back to this\nmorning right when Steve was talking\nabout this every time there was a\ntransition something\nbroke and this is true at the micro\nlevel when you bring things really small\nand at the level where people are moving\nfrom device to device or context to\ncontext at every scale we need to have\nthese hierarchies of these State\ndiagrams when I'm changing State and\nunderstand what the transitions are and\nand we need to be as effective as a game\ndesigner and or a filmmaker and how we\ndo those Transitions and my biggest\nsuggestion is we start recruiting people\nfrom the video game industry into\ndealing with that part of the creative\ndirection of our our\nproducts and there's two words that have\nto drive all of this type of how we do\nthe Transitions and how we make these\ngraceful changes and one with the term\nis seamless the other is graceful and I\nwant to talk about this in a sense\nbecause um we've all heard the world\nword like if you're going to have a uh\nsomething that's going to break down for\nsome other reason it should you know\nhave graceful degradation so let's let's\npush on that because we're a little bit\nfamiliar with that\nterm when we bring things together\nthat's an act of\naggregation we bring multiple devices\ntogether to work in\nconcert and of course when I take them\napart that's\ndisaggregation and what happens and\nshould be happening there in terms of\nthe value proposition and whatever\ncurrency is relevant for what we're\ndoing should by aggregation have\naugmentation of power and actually a\ndiminution of complexity by the way that\nI won't get to that level of detail\nthough but the same thing as I have\ndisaggregation I have degradation of\nthis whatever it was I was doing before\nthings will this just like the park tab\ncould be spectacularly powerful when\nit's working with here but it still is\nvaluable here it's just when I have the\naggregation I get more and maybe\ndifferent but it's it works this way but\nthe key thing is those two things are\ncoupled and and and the up and down\narrow is where the transitions lie and\nthat's where the real design effort\nneeds to take\nplace so uh yeah Derek uh sort of did\nthis thing this morning and it showed\nyou know look at all the stuff how many\nof you have this much stuff with you and\nso let's play a really quick game um\nwhat do you got with you Who's got\nwhat okay I you have a laptop okay\nwhat else come on sh it out we don't\nhave time\nslate a\ncamera what else\nphone it's not a phone it's a\nmobile anything\nelse paper\npen paper I see a video\ncamera oh what's wrong you on your\nfingers good enough\nthat's my invitation Steve Jobs\num that\nit well I got a\nwatch I get a wallet IP MP3\nplayer so I didn't say Zoom all right\nnow the snap shot\nhere might support the\nnotion that so what we're talking about\nare these different form factors of\ndifferent screen sizes and so on so\nforth and they're coming together and\nall that crap is all feeding back into\nalmost this sort of office directed\nbusiness kind of gooey blah you\nknow that's apparently\nwrong and what and we've got to go to\nthis new place where we have this other\ntype of aesthetic but but Jesse actually\ntalked about\na whole other way to think about this\nthis morning which I thought was pretty\ngood\nand come\non and all I can tell you is\nthat this thing isn't on your list now I\nactually don't have it with me right now\nbut that's called the wx7 and it's an\nelectronic saxophone I worked on it for\nYamaha back in 1982 I think is is that\ntrue no when it came out\n80 85 I think or\n86 but that's doesn't look like anything\nyou've described in fact I don't think\nanybody would call that a computer I\nthink it's just a musical instrument\nthat if you haven't practiced 10 hours a\nday for many days you're going to sound\nlike a piece of\ncrap especially when you have to program\nit and what I trying to say is that we\ndon't have to\nwait to find examples\nabout how digital devices are\nbeautifully integrated into our lives\nand here's the only problem nobody's\nmentioned is that if you want to be a\nreally really successful designer in our\nfield then prepare to be anonymous\nbecause the only time you should notice\ngreat design is or design is when it's\nbroken it's like Plumbing if there's\ncrap all over the floor you notice it\nbut if it if there's not you\ndon't right it's transparent it's just\nthere everything's where you need it and\nit might be beautiful so you might get a\nbit of styling stuff that but the\nprimary function is it doesn't draw\nundue attention to itself at a certain\npoint the design gets over the top and\nbecomes\nostentatious an ego rather than great\ndesign I just say that there's tons of\nexamples of things like this that\nalready\nexist and it's not have to move from\noffice or business types of things the\nstuff in the office belongs in the\noffice there's nothing wrong with an\noffice office and it's not the then the\ngraphic user interface on Excel is\nprobably the most natural user interface\nthat you can have if you're trying to do\nspreadsheets in an office on a desk\nwhich by the way doesn't mean that that\nsaxophone is a bad\nthing that thing is crap at doing your\nincom tax which is why it's good my\nExcel spreadsheet is great at doing\nspreadsheets but it's crap at doing\nmusic which is\ngood and it's this notion of strong\nspecific Tools in in the form factor the\na and then with the appropriate\ninterface that's appropriate for the\ntask that are dispersed through our\nenvironment that let things work here\nI'm going to say this really quickly\nbecause I don't have a lot of time but\neveryone in this room has probably had\nthis conversation I'm going to imitate\nmy wife right now Bill you're always on\nyour\ncomputer right everybody's had that\nright all right my father and mother in\nmy entire time growing up I never heard\nmy mother say my father he was also\nnamed Bill Bill you're always on your\npencil\nokay you're going to laugh out of the\nother side of your face when I tell\nother half of that story listen there's\nnothing that I do with a computer that\nmy father didn't used to do with a\npencil every activity that we\ndo more or less right statistically\nspeaking everything we do with the\ncomputer today was done with a pencil\nbefore but but the activities were\nvisible because of the other devices and\nother Technologies and the Loca other\nlocations where the activities took\nplace so therefore they were cues to let\nyou know I'm writing you a love letter\nI'm writing the Great Canadian novel I'm\npaying our income tax I'm actually\nbuying you a vacation off to you know\nTahiti or something like that I'm\nwriting my Paro parole board report\nwhatever but the point is they all had\nlocation and they had other things\naround that gave cues that you weren't a\nmonom manic thing and the computer\ndidn't dominate it disappeared the\nactivity became transparent or visible\nand the tools became\ntransparent that's your bous Computing\nand if you do everything through your\nmobile I'm sorry it doesn't cut it to\nshow me an example that took three hours\nto create of Windows every single\nfunction of of word I'm not criticizing\nI'm just saying think about this for a\nminute because critical thinking is\nreally\nyes we can make Windows fill up your\nentire screen but at the same token I\ncould load every free app from the App\nStore onto an iPhone and have the same\ntype of of of overrun ridiculous thing\nwhat good are 5,000 apps and that's not\neven that's the tip of the iceberg of\nwhat's available on my iPhone try and\nwork on that\ntoo Common Sense prevails but putting\noverloading\nanything pick your take your pick is\ngoing to make a mess\nand in terms of\nthis just to show that I used to have\nhair the can sense turn y up perhaps\nwe've hooked it up to a sound and so\nwe've got a high pure sound here this\ndescend and richness with\nX and degree controlling\nvolume and I can finger\npaint\n[Music]\nokay why am i showing you that because I\nwant to just again push these things\nabout beautiful gesture and movement\npredate the\nMacintosh that was 1982 that's that the\noriginal multi-touch device that was\nfirst published in 1985 so we were doing\nmulti-touch the same year mark zuker\nbird was born born and the same year the\nMacintosh was born okay that's how long\nit's been there and it was done to make\na drum a musical instrument not to do\nsomething in the office not to do\nsomething productive not to make money\nbut to do something and there's no\nthere's a very good reason for that no\nprofession has a longer history of\narticulating powerful and creative ideas\nthrough a technological intermediary\nthan musicians and the aesthetic we took\nwhen we were doing this stuff in terms\nof a lot of the gesture stuff the pen\nstuff and the touch stuff\nin the early days was to make musical\ninstruments that were worthy of playing\non stage as as performers that's the\naesthetic we brought and it's only\nrecently that that that at the mass\nproduced level we've been able to get\nthe means to deliver that in the broader\nspace but I have to tell you it was that\nthat and this work that got Alan Kay\nwhen he visited and saw it that drag got\nme to go to park the next\nweek now\nnow the as we come along through this\npath we start to realize that things are\nsnowballing out we have all of these\ndevices we have social networking we\nhave the internet just going crazy and\nmore and more and more and more and more\nas you so correctly said now I'm happy\nto prune some of the stuff\noff but there's social networks of\npeople and we've got the internet which\nis sort of like\nwhatever but for me\nI want to talk about the social network\nof\ndevices not because I'm a hardware\nperson but because of what I already\nsaid with that simple example of the\nwhiteboard in my tab when they start to\nwork together in concert when they when\nthey become a social network a nice\npairing but where they can also come off\nand be individuals for a while and I\nmight if if you get nothing else out of\nwhat I want to say it's this I believe\nthat going\nforward the only way we're going to\navoid Our Lives being po populated with\na whole bunch of G garbage\ngadgets just think of the remote\ncontrols that are on your living room uh\ncoffee table any one of which anybody\nknows how to use but together nobody in\nyour family knows how to turn on the TV\nafter you've watched a uh\nDVD it's going to get way\nworse and if you tell me you're going to\nhave a better at living room remote\ncontrol universal remote control take\nthat on the road when you you know just\nI'll give you another example and\nanother then we'll have so many\nuniversal remote controls in so many\nlocations the complexity just moves\nthere you fix it here it goes there take\ntake the two buttons off the mouse get a\none button Mouse you transfer the\ncomplexity that's always been the case\nagain you've already heard that but the\nquestion is by the right combinations of\nsimple devices where they augment each\nother we reduce complexity it's one of\nthe few cases where we have the\nopportunity if we do our job right where\nmore is less more of the right devices\ngives us less complexity and in fact\nmore of the the right devices is gives\nus more squared or to the nth power of\nvalue and that's what this network\nbrings now we're in this sort of network\nand mesh of things and there's a lot of\nways we have to think about it and it\nseems to me that in this web and and so\non so forth we have to ask one\nfundamental question and that question\nis who's the\nspider and even there this sounds like a\nstupid question maybe and it's maybe\njust a way CU I like getting my\nphotographs and my slides and then\nfiguring out a way I can rationalize it\nbut it's in this\ncase is the cloud The Spider and then we\nall hang off the cloud and so we're the\ntentacles at the very end gripping hang\nout the tree for deal life so we don't\nspring in the Spider-Man fashion or is\nit you and me the people that are at the\ncenter of this and I'd\nargue that the way I think about these\nthings is that I'm the center of my own\nweb and my web is Interlink with your\nweb and so our our networks our webs can\ncan link and the social networking isn't\nlink from me to you it's my web to yours\nsome of which may overlap but my\nimmediate web is made up of the devices\nthat I personally own and then how they\ninteract with the things that might be\nembedded in the environment that I'm\nmoving through in the public space and\nto the things of people are in my close\nNetwork how they might be able to start\nhave that kind of relationship\ntoo and the key thing about this is\nforget the technical part what are the\nsocial mores of approach and departure\nand connection and I going to do this\nall the time but um this is you're Irish\nso you can take this okay right I'm\ngoing to give my talk just like this\nright now this is kind of\nstrange right and he said nasty things\nabout Microsoft so I didn't put my\nstylus in his ear now the deal is this\nyou're laughing because it's so it's the\nonly thing to do other than being a\nguest because it's so\ninappropriate\nbut watch this I'm going to do something\nequally terrible i've got my cell phone\nI just put it against her\nlaptop so\nwhat who gives a crap who cares nobody\nknows electronically in that web they\ndon't know each other exist if I put it\nside my laptop it has no idea it exists\nthey're both running\nWindows what's with\nthat proximity approach departure and by\nthe way as I got a certain distance away\nfrom you when I bet if we both wrote\ndown we could predict exactly how far I\ngot away from you when you started to\nfeel comfortable again\nright we're guys what can I\nsay but this is really important and I'd\nargue if you want to think about when\nyou talk about ubiquitous computing\nthe reason I you know I'm not picking\nanybody but when I put the saxophone up\nand the drum and and this sort of stuff\nas well as the computer\nscreens or phone screens or whatever\nthey\nare that the way to calibrate is this\nprend their browsers okay in the future\nthe\ndiversity of web browsers is going to\nmatch the current diversity of Inc\nbrowsers\nand Inc browsers are also known as\npaper and if you want to do your\nethnography study then get the people in\nyour team or your clients or yourselves\nyou can make money doing this with your\nclients is that they have to do a\n24-hour diary study where they take an\ninventory of every encounter they have\nwith paper over the course of 24 hours\nwhere they n not only notate what it was\nwhere it is how big it was what's the\nmessage how long should it be there what\ndid it cost and so on so\nforth because every one of those is a\npotential case where our interactive\ndigital things are going to have a place\ngoing\nforward from\nmoney to newspapers to posters to\nBillboards to labels I literally\nyesterday I saw here in Lisbon a company\nthat's making things that are electronic\ndisplays that are going to are at a\nprice point now where there can be\nlabels on products like Coca-Cola\nbottles at that level of M\nmanufacturing so this is not\nexaggerating I'm just saying this is\nhappening where\nappropriate the technology is no longer\nthe inhibitor this is the most important\nthing that we all should\nrecognize the reason things were\ndifficult before in the era that ended\nabout 5 years\nago was because the miracle was anything\nwe built actually\nworked and that could be sold I don't\nmean we Microsoft I mean we as an\nindustry it was a miracle that we could\nactually get this stuff working\nsufficiently reliable that we could get\nmoney out of cash machines and not feel\nnervous and so on so forth and send\nmoney with PayPal and so on so\nforth those days are\ngone and the only question that if you\ncan't make it work you shouldn't be in\nbusiness now that we can make anything\nwork the ultimate question is what's\nworth making work how should it work now\nthat we can do anything what should we\ndo\nand that's what this is about and my\nview is my focus these days is not about\nany single device if you can't make\nsomething as good as anything Apple\nmakes or anything as bit good as the\nconnect it shouldn't be in\nbusiness I take that for granted just\nlike I take for granted when I drive\nover a bridge that it doesn't fall down\nand it looks really\ngood right it's just engineering it's\ndesign that's professional it's just\ndoing your job the next job is make the\nstuff work\ntogether so we I want to come back to\nthe paper thing though just to make my\npoint because I every once in a while\nPoint needs to be emphasized redundancy\nisn't a bad thing we think about eaper\nand\nebooks and e-readers but you hard to\never think about a newsprint uh magazine\nstraight off the stand this is the 75th\nAnniversary issue of Esquire Magazine\nfrom October 2008 it has an e in exactly\nthe same technology that's in your\nKindle not only in the front cover but\non the inside cover there's an\nadvertisement that that is quasi\nanimated\nwith the battery and everything in the\ncover for the same price as the regular\nmagazine sound that thing blew me away\nwhen I saw it because I'm supposed to\nknow about this stuff I'm supposed to be\nsome kind of visionary and it caught me\ncompletely with my pants down I had no\nidea and then a year later almost\nexactly came\nthis this is an issue that was on the\nnews stands in New York City and and and\nin Hollywood of Entertainment Weekly and\non it there is a 2-in LCD television set\nin the print edition for the same price\nand it has 6 hours of Replay on the\nbattery and it had 40 minutes of video\ninside it it had trailers for every\nsingle show that was going to be\nlaunched in the fall season for CBS it\nwas sponsored by pepsicola and and these\nbuttons along the side here are the\nchannel Changers you could just push and\nselect which show you wanted to look\nat\nand if that doesn't just give your\nentire conceptual framework if you\naren't familiar with this a total\nrefresh and rewrite in terms of how\nbroad should we be thinking we talk\nabout e-readers and ebooks and\ne-publishing I don't know what else it\ntakes because this floors me I chase\nboth those down I have working versions\nof both of them because I just can't\nbelieve it and I want to show them\npeople all the time whenever I\ncan and and that speaks to what I said\nabout ink\nbrowsers if we can do that what\neconomically in a business what else can\nwe do well this is what else we can do\nthis is what they used to do in London\nto change the the posters um I can't\nremember when Sid Kai was in Vienna but\nI think it was at least six years ago\nbut already six years ago in Vienna they\nhad projectors mounted above the Subways\nand they replaced the paper with\nprojected video and by the way it was\nthe worst crap content I've ever seen in\nmy life it was like the QVC Shopping\nChannel it was like these people had no\nidea about media it's got a projector\nit's video so it must be\nTelevision right and they had no idea\nand there's no way to interact with it\nthat's the other part but that's then\nthis is now think about it Subways are\nthe most perfect place to have\nprojection because there's no daylight\nyou've got a controlled lighting\nenvironment you don't get killed or\nelectrocuted when you're on the tracks\nwith your with your ladders and that\nstuff can be changed by time of day and\nso on so forth and you could if if\nthings were done right use your Mobile\nto actually take things from that but\nwe're going to I get ahead of myself\nwe'll come back to that in fact I'm\ngoing to do it right\nnow every place you see one of these\nposters these advertisements on a bus\nshelter that are made out of film with\nback lit with uh with lights that is\ngoing to be a thin film polymer display\nthat's on the net whether it's wireless\nor tethered who cares it's got\nprocessing power it's on the network\nit's there and it can be changed by time\nof day and so on so forth and it can do\nall kinds of other things but here's the\nnature of the types of how our\ntransactions can start to change and\nthere's very subtle things that come out\nof there so you come up with your La\nyour phone because I'm Stranger in Town\nand I come up and I pull out my phone\nand I by pointing my phone at the device\nby the way all I'm asking here is that\nmy mobile phone be able to do my\nso-called smartphone what a term um if\nyou call these things smart I think\nthink we should all stop using that term\nthey're smarter phones in the sense\nthey're smarter than the phones we had\nbefore but if you take this as smart\nthen I worry about the people you hire\nbecause you probably think they're smart\ntoo would you hire your phone if it was\na ux designer given its level of\nintelligence okay that's what I'm saying\nall right now if I could do what my Palm\nPilot could do in 1996 that is without\nany handshaking just point it at your\nPalm Pilot push a button and pass you my\nbusiness card or an address whatever I\nwanted which I cannot do Bluetooth\ndoesn't let you do that because what I\npointed at you it's going to the person\nin the room on the other side of that\nwall we can't do that yet this isn't\njust about software it's the whole deal\nit's the entire ecos system just like\nthose three buttons like a trumpet on\nthe PDA of the park tab but Watch What\nHappens I do it Bingo up Pops a map\nbecause that's what I asked\nfor why would I use the dinky screen on\nmy\nsmartphone when I've Got That honk and\nbig display there that Nike is willing\nto loan me and now I'll just use the\ntouchpad here the same way I use the\ntouchpad on my laptop to control\nwhatever's up there on the big screen by\nthe way it doesn't have to be a map you\nand I could be playing video games we're\nwaiting for the best or whatever\nwhatever is appropriate but the point is\nnotice two or three things this simple\ncoupling the aggregation of these two\nthings reduces complexity for people\nlike me that are 63 I just became a\ngrandfather and I can't read as well as\nI used to so I appreciate the big screen\nthank you very much and I want to be\nable to get the information and take\nadvantage of it and I don't want to be\nsearching around for\nhotspots but just a minute all of my\nexperience with ads online have been\nbanner ads and popup ads that are\nabsolutely pissing me\noff they get in my way and despite the\nfact I know intellectually that they're\npaying for my free stuff I still resent\nthem cuz I want it free and I don't want\nto be charged for it in any way at all\nin inconvenience in that it's nothing's\nfree by the way you we'll talk about the\nvaluation for of Facebook and what\nyou're act what they're actually buying\non the boat tonight but anyhow the point\nhere notice what has happened and by the\nway I love advertising because it it\nkeeps us going but here's the\npoint by this simple thing I just\ndid seemingly just coupling up two\ndevices heterogeneous\ndevices almost like the lifeboard right\nthe big display with the Palm a handheld\nexactly the same with before but in a\ndifferent context therefore different\nproduct I've completely reversed or\ntransformed the relationship between me\nand the advertisement and The\nAdvertiser I have always had an annoying\npopup ad on my\napplication I have a welcome popup\napplication on the ad\nand if I know that Nike offers that to\nme I'm going to search it out every\nplace and furthermore popup ads you get\nrid of they're not persistent and\nthey're in your peripheral vision and we\nknow the F con of vision is about 14\ndegrees and you're up close you're not\ngoing to see them\nanyhow I've put a Nike Swoosh Watermark\nright in the fulvio cone of vision in\nthe center of the app in know such a way\nthat it does not intrude with my ability\nto use the map or the application but I\nstill got the imprint of the\nbrand see I'm not disrespecting the ads\nI want the ads to work for everybody\nincluding\nme and it's this notion of coupling that\nopens up completely different\nopportunities because now is that a\nphone app or is it a is it an outdoor\nadvertising app or is it a service Kiosk\napp the answer is yes to all of the\nabove but the relationships among the\npeople in the ecosystem that play in\nthis have to change dramatically to make\nthis stuff actually work and by the way\njust to give you an example that I'm not\nsmoking crack or anything like\nthat in Yahoo's already implemented um\ntouch screens of that size in bus\nshelters in Washington DC and in the Bay\nArea to do field trials so this is not\nthat far away Gibson was right the\nfuture's already here it's not just not\nuniformly distributed and if you read my\nessays about the long nose you'll you'll\nunderstand that these things have been\naround for\ndecades\nso some examples just as I wrap up\nwe have to become collectors we have to\nstart to actually watch around and just\nlike people don't notice things like a\nsaxophone because it's a saxophone not a\ncomputer it's a camera not a computer a\ncamera is just a computer with P light\nin and and pixels\nout use a spring taxs your mp3 player\nit's not a it's it's a computer but\nnobody calls it that\nway your Nintendo\nDS can absolutely my kids are all\nsitting around in the same room playing\nlike Mario Kart\nparty which really interesting too this\nis a little bit more hetrogeneous as\nopposed to homogeneous Network whereas\nthe electronic cart Scrabble you can\nactually use that for plain Scrabble one\nof the modes that comes is that you use\nyour your iPad sorry your iPhone or your\niPod Touch for the tiles and an iPad for\nthe game and you can sit and mimic the\nround table social thing it's it changes\ncompletely the social nature of playing\nelectronic\ngames um Nest learning has a thermostat\nget this a normal digital thermostat\ncosts about $25 to $30 this thing cost\n$250 and they can't make them fast\nenough because you can uh use your\niPhone or whatever your mobile to to\ncontrol the heat and set the Heat and\nturn it down you're driving home from\nthe um from a 3we vacation in the winter\nyou can turn the heat up so the house is\nwarm you don't have to do any of this\nfancy programming now all of the things\nthings around this remember I said it's\nabout the transitions transitions are\nthe transactions are are are the key\npart of the\ntransactions and if we step outside of\nour own um small world the there's some\nTheory and knowledge that we can apply\nreally to how we think about these\nthings how we evaluate because the term\nkeeps coming up and I think\nappropriately so how do you measure how\ndo you determine for yourself much less\nyour clients or your boss or anyone else\num or even sell it to your customers\nwhat why this is better and why you\nwould do this instead of that and the\nanswer is taken from this guy Edmund Co\nsorry Ronald Coast 1991 he won the Nobel\nPrize he won the Nobel Prize for this\ntheory of TR of how firms interplayed uh\namongst themselves according to the cost\nof doing business\ntransactions and this notion of\ntransaction cost should be in every\nsingle one of our vocabulary it should\ndominate all of our conversations if we\ncare about Transitions and transactions\nand say what is the cost\nbut that's not a good enough question\nyou have to say what are the currencies\nthat are relevant in this\ncontext According to which we determine\nmuch less measure the cost what should\nit cost and what's determined and what's\nthe exchange rate amongst these other\ncurrencies otherwise we cannot do an\nappropriate cost benefit\nanalysis that notion of different\ncurrencies exchange rates among them and\nthen cost benefit analysis on the cost\nof the transition it could be learning\nhow long do it take learn what's the\nrisk of failure what's the enjoyment\nFactor you know what's how what kind of\nAC does it take and so on so forth\nwhat's the Comfort level how how subtle\ncan it be or how loud is it all those\nthings are important to think about it\nbut it it really plays into\nthis and I want to give you some\nexamples all through I've tried to throw\nexamples that you can buy today to show\nthat the future really is there we can\nwe don't have to start from from a\nstanding\nstart but one of the arguments I think\nthat everybody gets over and over and\nover again is it uh no no why should we\ndo that you can already do that why\nwould I pay for that why would you add\nthat to my product look you can always\nit in in when we were doing Maya which\nis this three package every time I said\nhere we could really streamline the\ninterface by making it really simple\nthis is what people do they're not doing\nthis and this and that they just want to\ndo that they say well you can already do\nthat look and they give the cutest thing\nthat I fallen asleep by the time they\nfinish telling me how to get there from\nhere I want us this propose pretend I\nhave a consumer electronics product\nthat's in everybody's home and that\nconsumer electronics product works\npretty well people love it it works and\nthey they spend hours and hours and\nhours a day with that consumer\nelectronics product let's pretend we\ncall it\ntelevision and let's pretend I am some\nidiot at Sylvania decides I'm going to\nput on on make the customer pay for an\nentirely second set of controls I'm\ngoing to get a second volume control a\nsecond channel changer and a second\nonoff switch and I'm going to make them\npay for it now by the same logic that\nevery one of you have had by your\nmanagement at least once tell you you\ncan already do that why would we add\nthat I'm going to say I'm going to do it\nanyhow we should do it I'd love to meet\nthe person who made this argument and\nactually got this to happen because what\nthey\ndid for that television is the added the\nremote\ncontrol it's absolutely useless it\nbrings zero new functionality from any\nengineering\nperspective but the one thing that\nchanged was the transaction\ncost and think about this for a\nminute when we were in that period of\ntransition if I went to a hotel that did\nnot have remote controls in the hotel\nrooms I never went back to that hotel\nroom again in the same way today if you\ncharge for Wi-Fi I don't go back to your\nhotel\nagain it saved you getting up out of\nyour seat was it good for the health of\nNorth Americans or of people\nno but it's sold so it's good for the\nhealth of the investors we got to deal\nwith those things and by the way this is\nthe first one I this is one of the first\nones I own this and they were called\nclickers because the original ones\nworked with acoustic sounds when you\npush the buttons down they made a\ndistinct sound you could each button\nmade a different sound uh and it was a\nclicking sound and it was a microphone\nthat could sense those and that's how it\nit wasn't ir and it wasn't um Bluetooth\nand and and but it was that was those\nwere the first wireless remote controls\nbut that's why they're called\nclickers\nnow Peter today just said some really\ninteresting stuff and and he talked\nabout the right multis and he talked\nabout taxonomies and multi- channel\nmultimodal um and and and so on so forth\nand and again this says that's good\nbecause I don't have to talk about it\nmore I just want to make a couple things\nto say here's here's another distinction\nto help a meaningful dimension of\ndifferentiation that helps us carve up\nthe space in terms of a meaningful\ntaxonomy that helps us reduce and\ndeliver here's\nconnect this is connect being used to\ncontrol the TV as a foreground activity\nokay this is my foreground intentional\naction my job now my purpose is to a\ngame therefore everything else get out\nof my face this is the interface\nright but here's the earlier version of\nconnect you may not have known this but\nbut connect's been shipping for\ndecades and you didn't even notice\nperhaps and here's example this is a\nStaples other what other than a an early\nversion of connect is the optical sensor\nabove the door at the business supply\nCenter there that opens the door for you\nand what other is it than a video game\nwhere the game opens the door for you as\nyou go out with this with the with the\num with a buggy now this is really\nimportant that is a foreground task my\ntask is to play the game My foreground\ntask here again it comes right back to\nwhat you heard earlier today is it is to\nget out of the store and get what I\nbought into the car to go home and\nbecause I got this buggy in front of me\nI can't reach the door to open it\nand therefore just opens for me by\nproximity sensing that's connect it's a\ntrivial gesture but here's the thing it\nis a computer but unlike it in the Sega\nesqu having billions and billions and\nbillions of switches it has one switch\nbut that one switch is smarter than any\nof your computers or mine for this\npurpose because it senses activities in\nthe environment the same way you sensed\nme and acts on accordingly but the\nintelligence is in the location and\nplacement of that switch it's notice\nit's not on the bank\nvault and what it does is it offloads\ncomplexity adding technology reduces the\ninterference the task interference that\nwould otherwise Exist by opening the\ndoor and it come\nthrough it it has\nvalue and to close the loop by the\nway and this is why this type of\nanalytical thinking really helps us do a\nbetter job\nis we've only done half the job because\nI'm live in Canada you think it's\nhorrible weather in Ireland for you\nshould live where I am when in the\nspringtime you got a foot of sloppy wet\nsnow and you got paper bags of groceries\nand you come up to the back of your car\nyour keys are in your pocket or your\npurse and you've got to put the bags\ndown on the wet snow to open up the\ntrunk of the car and then in order to\nput these things\nin now just let me do a little\narithmetic here my car\nwhose keys are in my\npocket that even lights up when I walk\npast it at night time because it's got\nkeyless entry\nsocalled I have to put my bags down get\nthem soaking wet and get my keys out the\nsupermarket which I don't even own I\ndon't even know who owns it opens the\ndoor for me why does my own $30,000 car\ntreat me worse than the\nstore and why isn't connect of some\nversion in the back of the of the car it\nrecognizes me by my key fob it knows I'm\nthere I can see with a 3D imaging that\nI've got bags in my hand at least in the\nsupermarket if I have to put my bags\ndown the floor is\ndry and way we go but you realize it's\nall about offloading complexity and\nsaying what's the foreground task what's\nyour principal task again you've heard\nthis already this afternoon I don't have\nto repeat it except my grandmother was\nIrish she's a Doyle and\nand so we go but here's another better\nexample I'll wrap up with this because\nthis is really important here's my car\nthis really is my car mine's black but\nit's a Ford Escape I gave my BMW which\nis about 6 years old to my kid as a\ngraduation presentent so he could pay\nthe service bills instead of\nme he works for a bank he's okay he can\nafford it\nand and I bought it because it has sink\nin it which is a this the software that\nsynchronizes now here's my\nphone now it's really interesting to me\nand this is the most delightful thing I\nexperience with Computing devices that\nmakes me whenever I feel upset or\nfrustrated with what I see in the\nsoftware industry this puts a smile on\nmy face think about this for a minute my\nphone it works okay I get in my phone my\ncar I throw it in the passenger seat I\ndrive away I turn on the stereo I'm\nlisten to music everything's good and\nthe phone rings my hands don't leave the\nsteering wheel my eyes don't leave the\nthing I go bang hello I have a\nconversation\nall right so you start of\nsaywell so what well because that was\nmagic think about this for a minute who\nknows what a mobile phone\nis hands please chickens come on come on\ncome on be brave be brave be honest all\nright you with the glasses back there\nyou put up your hands uh where is the\nmobile phone in that transaction I just\ndescribed\nseat on the car seat how many people\nagree with him the naive young\nman all right let me let me just do a\nlittle bit of electron Jour I am a you\nknow I am a Scientist please don't try\nthis at home\nhowever the only thing that's being used\nof that phone is the Sim chip the\nBluetooth trans transceiver the battery\nand a tiny tiny bit of\nlogic everything else is in the car the\nspeech recognition in the car the\naddress book in the car the speaker in\nthe car it even turns down the instead\nof opening the door it turns down the\nstereo so I can hear the call and the\nmicrophone in the\ncar the correct answer where is it I\nthink the best answer is\nyes and the next best answer or perhaps\neven a better answer say who cares are\nyou having a good\nconversation no are you having an\nappropriate conversation because notice\nif that magic didn't happen I should\nlose my driver's license oh because this\nbrings another thing ask anybody talk to\nsomebody from Microsoft if you really\nwant to put the if you really want to\nget them going say so what's this uh\ninterface what's the interaction\nlanguage for Windows Phone 7 by the way\nyou can do the same thing with people\nfrom uh from Apple but they just don't\nhave a name I gu they do for the\ninterface Style on on the iPhone but I\njust don't know what it is cuz I don't\nwork Apple but the I'm kidding here's\nthe deal I no I'm not kidding about not\nworking for Apple I'm just kidding\nhere's the\ndeal if somebody says\nMetro just say I beg your pardon mean\nwhen I'm driving my car and I'm using\nsink and with a speech that I'm using\nmetro well guess what you're\nnot and this is the re-education all of\nus have to have no it's Metro when Metro\nis\nappropriate it's not Metro when Metro is\ninappropriate like when you're driving a\ncar so that if my after I've hung up the\nphone and I I have a text I get a voice\nhey your wife just no Liz is just texted\nyou you want to take you want to hear it\nyes I'll read it to you bang she reads\nit to me it's a woman who's in my car\nthe computer and I don't know why but\nit's it's okay um my wife approves\nand when she's speaking to me after\nshe's finished she says would you like\nto reply yes okay start dictating I\ndictate would you like me to dick read\nback what I think you said yes I have to\nsay honestly it's never made a mistake\nso yes send\nit then here's the best\npart\nI my son\nphones I park the car I'm still in a\nconversation I pick up the phone off the\nseat turn the as after I've turned the\nkey off and I just go like this and walk\ndown the\nstreet and 90% of the technology at the\nlocal end supporting my call just\nchanged completely\nseamlessly and\ntransparently as I disaggregated so I\nhad disaggregation I don't have all the\nfancy speech stuff anymore and I'm back\nto\nMetro but because everything changed 90%\nof the technology changed I had zero\nchange in the continuity of the\nconversation and so when anybody says\nyour user interface has to be consistent\njust say give them this example example\nright I tell these stories because\nstories are the most original form of\nviral marketing make them your own\npretend you you invented it place it in\nyour own context personalize it but have\nthese in your hip pocket so you can say\nno consistency unless you can guarantee\nthere's consistency in context location\nand people and task in when people use\nthis application or this device then\nthen\nforget this notion of consistency other\nthan consistency in quality of\nexperience\nand consistency in\nvalue those are the only consistencies\nthat matter because they're the ones\nexpressed in human\nterms that's the stylesheet we should\nwrite\nfirst all right we're wrapping\nup this I love this right you can't\ndepend on your eyes when your\nimagination's out of focus these things\nwe've been doing today just going on the\nship tonight the reason to get out of\ntown get out of your computer is to help\nour imagination\ngrow PR said the only true Voyage of\nDiscovery is not to go to different\nplaces but to see through different\neyes and our job is to be the best damn\nwhat do you call them OB not\nObstetricians uh what's an eye doctor\nanyhow optometrists in the\nworld and with that I'm going to stop\nsay thank you very much and I'm happy to\ntake\nquestions\n",
