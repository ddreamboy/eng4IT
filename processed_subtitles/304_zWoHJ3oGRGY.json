  "text": "so have you ever wondered what kind of\ninformation is being sent back and forth\nbetween your computer and the internet\nwhat applications are reaching out and\nwhat data is being sent perhaps you're\nconnecting to things you're unaware of\nmaybe you're even hacked and your\ncomputer is connecting to attackers the\nway to answer all of these questions is\ngoing to be using a tool called War\nshark which gives you an inside view of\nwhat's happening on your network of\ncourse if you're not used to looking at\npackets this is going to look very\nintimidating but I'm going to make it\nreally simple so let's start at the\nbeginning so when you open this\napplication for the first time after\ninstall it's going to show you a list of\nall the different network interfaces\nthat are on your computer and ask you\nwhich one you want to capture as you can\nsee here we have two options where we\nhave a little graph here that shows you\nsomething is happening some kind of\nmovement is taking place this is the\nethernet so it's the ethernet port on my\ncomputer through which I'm currently\nconnected to the internet but if you're\nconnected via Wi-Fi make sure you select\nthat instead now once this is open as\nyou can see our window is being flooded\nwith a lot of information and that is\nbecause this is how the computer works\nnowadays we constantly are sending\ninformation back and forth from our\ncomputer to the network a lot of it is\nbackground applications but it's really\ndifficult to make sense of this so if I\ngo ahead and open up my browser and\nlet's say we just do a simple Google\nsearch let's just do a Google search for\nYark now as we're doing that if we go\nover to Yark you can see that we have a\nton of stuff and among that we can see\nsome websites that appear linked to\nGoogle and we can click on pretty much\nany of these things to see the\ninformation that we're sending and I\nknow what you're thinking Leo this is\nnot English this is gibberish and that's\nwhat you would normally find if you\nlooked at a random packet a packet is\nkind of like a package you get from\nAmazon it's a bunch of data grouped\ntogether to be sent over the internet\nand if we see on the left we can see the\ndescription of it so we've got\n1292 bytes bytes are a unit of data and\njust like grams for weight but there are\ndifferent ways in which information can\nbe sent and that is going to be defined\nby the protocol so for example DNS means\ndomain name system so this is\ninformation that is being sent out to\nget the address of a computer or a\nserver to communicate with based on a\nname so let's say you want to reach\nGoogle so your computer says I want to\nreach Google where can I find it the\ndomain name system basically gives it\nthe address of the computer closes to\nyou where Google is serving data and\nthat little bit of information is going\nto be super useful to us in simplifying\nthis view because right now we're seeing\nall the different protocols through\nwhich communication is happening so for\nexample if we take a look at tlsv1.2 to\nwhich means the information is jumbled\nup for security and that is why it looks\nlike gibberish just like what you would\nsee in a file encrypted by ransomware\nbut if we go ahead and select the search\nfilter and type in\nDNS boom now it makes a lot more sense\nat least the top bit cuz you can start\nto read the names of different websites\nso we have google.com we have\nmsn.com and the various subdomains that\ncome with it we even have gamep pass.com\nwe have have Windows update and I'm sure\nthis is now starting to make sense and\non the left we can see the source\naddress and the destination address\nwhich is kind of like a street address\nor like your postcode but on the\ninternet but most importantly simply\nreading the domain name here like game\npass.com can tell you that your computer\nmade a request to connect to a Game Pass\nserver similarly I can see Windows\ntrying to sneakily download updates in\nthe background it loves doing that\nespecially when I'm low on battery and\nin order to demonstrate that this works\nwe can simply go ahead and open a\nwebsite so let's say we go to the PC\nsecurity\nchannel.com so if we go ahead and visit\nmy very own website you're going to see\nthe NY shark it is going to pop up as a\nnew request so over here you can see the\nPCC channel.com referenced various times\nbut the interesting thing is you're also\ngoing to see references to other\nwebsites like youtube.com even though we\nnever really VIs listed YouTube and this\nis where it gets interesting so the\nreason you're seeing youtube.com being\nloaded even though we never visited it\nis because if we take a look at this\nwebsite in the background you have\nYouTube videos so I do have YouTube\nvideos Linked In order to get these\nthumbnails and the information about\nthese videos so you can see them your\ncomputer also automatically has to\nconnect to youtube.com so let's say a\nwebsite was trying to track you or\nconnect you to a third party ad website\nguess what you would see requests to\nthat advertising website right here so\nfor example let's say we go to\ncnn.com I know it's cringe I'm sorry as\nyou can see we do get\nwww.cnn.com but along with that there is\na long list of websites and subdomains\nso media. CNN.com also youtube.com\nbecause they have YouTube videos Cookie\nlaw.org jsd deliver. net turner.com\nmedium.\nntv.io bitm moving.com Warner media\ncdn.com so you can already tell how this\ntool is super useful in understanding\nwhat's actually behind a website\nsimilarly if we go to cet.com and open\nup War shark as you can see we are\ngetting queries to ad tech. redventures\ndoio so this is probably a thirdparty\nadvertising company that that is\nembedded within this website so I think\nyou're starting to see the investigative\npower of this tool even if you're simply\nlooking into DNS requests and nothing\nelse now what if you wanted to know\nwhat's happening in your computer in the\nbackground well all you have to do is\njust keep it running and observe the\ntraffic coming in so if I do a contrl f\nand look for specific strings for\nexample let's say I look for Discord as\nyou can see we are reaching out to\ndiscord.com and that's because I have\nDiscord running so in the background\nit's going to be communicating similarly\nif we try Microsoft you're going to see\na ton of hits for Microsoft exchanging\ndata in the background if you have\nSpotify running it's going to show\nSpotify and I'm only doing a search to\nspeed this up but what's going to happen\nis as those Communications are taking\nplace it is going to pop up at the\nbottom so this is again a good way to\nknow what kind of communications your\ncomputer is doing what sites are you\nconnecting to what applications you\nmight have running in the background\neven if they're not visible necessarily\nWithin Windows cuz a lot of time an\napplication may be running as a service\nin which case you're not going to see it\non your computer or even see it in task\nmanager but it might still be connecting\nto websites in the background so I hope\nthis helps you get started with your\ninvestigating Journey with wi shark you\ncan try it right now and see what kind\nof connections your computer is making\nand the best part is you can do this\nregardless of whether you're using\nWindows Mac or Linux would love to hear\nin the comments if you found anything on\nyour computer that surprised you now\nI've obviously been using using this\ntool a lot in my past videos so I wanted\nto do a quick tutorial so everybody has\nthese basic skills and can understand\nwhat I'm talking about when I'm using it\nlike and share this video If you enjoyed\nit and do let me know in the comments if\nyou'd like to see more videos like this\nby the way a big thank you to malware\nbites for sponsoring this video and some\nof our other educational videos recently\nto Showcase their newest version of\nmalware bites premium as you can see\nthey have a very slick looking dark mode\nvery easy to use user interface many of\nyou may know them as the legendary\nsecond opinion scanner but now of course\nthey have realtime protection along with\nransomware protection and exploit\nmitigation stuff personally I really\nlike the fact that they have an option\nto block pent testing attacks I always\nturn this on in case somebody's trying\nto connect to a command and control\nserver it's going to block stuff like\nthat now it also gives you the option of\nhaving an integrated VPN so if you're\nwondering well if I can see all those\nwebsites in war shark anyone with\ncontrol of the Wi-Fi network can and\nthat is where this comes in handy so if\nyou turn on your VPN all of that\ninformation will now be hidden making\nyour browsing activity invisible to your\nISP and once again this is a\nfull-featured security solution it\nreplaces Windows Defender and you can\ncheck it out right now by going to link\nin description getting a free troll\nyou'll have access to exactly this of\ncourse we've done independent tests of\nmalor byes in the past so feel free to\nlook that up on our YouTube channel and\nwe will be testing this more in the\nfuture but for now just wanted to thank\nthem for sponsoring our educational\ncontent and showing the appreciate the\ncyber security awareness that we bring\nso do check them out using link in\ndescription thank you all so much for\nwatching really appreciate it don't\nforget to subscribe to our Channel we're\nsuper close to 500,000 subscribers so\nlet's get there this is Leo and as\nalways stay informed stay secure\n",
