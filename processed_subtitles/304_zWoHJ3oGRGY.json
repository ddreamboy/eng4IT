  "text": "so have you ever wondered what kind of\ninformation is being sent back and forth\nbetween your computer and the internet\nwhat applications are reaching out and\nwhat data is being sent perhaps you're\nconnecting to things you're unaware of\nmaybe you're even hacked and your\ncomputer is connecting to attackers the\nway to answer all of these questions is\ngoing to be using a tool called War\nshark which gives you an inside view of\nwhat's happening on your network of\ncourse if you're not used to looking at\npackets this is going to look very\nintimidating but I'm going to make it\nreally simple so let's start at the\nbeginning so when you open this\napplication for the first time after\ninstall it's going to show you a list of\nall the different network interfaces\nthat are on your computer and ask you\nwhich one you want to capture as you can\nsee here we have two options where we\nhave a little graph here that shows you\nsomething is happening some kind of\nmovement is taking place this is the\nethernet so it's the ethernet port on my\ncomputer through which I'm currently\nconnected to the internet but if you're\nconnected via Wi-Fi make sure you select\nthat instead now once this is open as\nyou can see our window is being flooded\nwith a lot of information and that is\nbecause this is how the computer works\nnowadays we constantly are sending\ninformation back and forth from our\ncomputer to the network a lot of it is\nbackground applications but it's really\ndifficult to make sense of this so if I\ngo ahead and open up my browser and\nlet's say we just do a simple Google\nsearch let's just do a Google search for\nYark now as we're doing that if we go\nover to Yark you can see that we have a\nton of stuff and among that we can see\nsome websites that appear linked to\nGoogle and we can click on pretty much\nany of these things to see the\ninformation that we're sending and I\nknow what you're thinking Leo this is\nnot English this is gibberish and that's\nwhat you would normally find if you\nlooked at a random packet a packet is\nkind of like a package you get from\nAmazon it's a bunch of data grouped\ntogether to be sent over the internet\nand if we see on the left we can see the\ndescription of it so we've got\n1292 bytes bytes are a unit of data and\njust like grams for weight but there are\ndifferent ways in which information can\nbe sent and that is going to be defined\nby the protocol so for example DNS means\ndomain name system so this is\ninformation that is being sent out to\nget the address of a computer or a\nserver to communicate with based on a\nname so let's say you want to reach\nGoogle so your computer says I want to\nreach Google where can I find it the\ndomain name system basically gives it\nthe address of the computer closes to\nyou where Google is serving data and\nthat little bit of information is going\nto be super useful to us in simplifying\nthis view because right now we're seeing\nall the different protocols through\nwhich communication is happening so for\nexample if we take a look at tlsv1.2 to\nwhich means the information is jumbled\nup for security and that is

    "reason you're seeing youtube.com being",

    "website in the background you have",
    "YouTube videos so I do have YouTube",
    "videos Linked In order to get these",
    "thumbnails and the information about",
    "these videos so you can see them your",

    "so media. CNN.com also youtube.com",
    "because they have YouTube videos Cookie",
    "law.org jsd deliver. net turner.com",
    "medium.",
    "ntv.io bitm moving.com Warner media",
    "cdn.com so you can already tell how this",
    "tool is super useful in understanding",
    "what's actually behind a website",
    "similarly if we go to cet.com and open",
    "up War shark as you can see we are",
    "getting queries to ad tech. redventures",
    "doio so this is probably a thirdparty",
    "advertising company that that is",
    "embedded within this website so I think",
    "you're starting to see the investigative",
    "power of this tool even if you're simply",
    "looking into DNS requests and nothing",
    "else now what if you wanted to know",
    "what's happening in your computer in the",
    "background well all you have to do is",
    "just keep it running and observe the",
    "traffic coming in so if I do a contrl f",
    "and look for specific strings for",
    "example let's say I look for Discord as",
    "you can see we are reaching out to",
    "discord.com and that's because I have",
    "Discord running so in the background",
    "it's going to be communicating similarly",
    "if we try Microsoft you're going to see",
    "a ton of hits for Microsoft exchanging",
    "data in the background if you have",
    "Spotify running it's going to show",
    "Spotify and I'm only doing a search to",
    "speed this up but what's going to happen",
    "is as those Communications are taking",
    "place it is going to pop up at the",
    "bottom so this is again a good way to",
    "know what kind of communications your",
    "computer is doing what sites are you",
    "connecting to what applications you",
    "might have running in the background",
    "even if they're not visible necessarily",
    "Within Windows cuz a lot of time an",
    "application may be running as a service",
    "in which case you're not going to see it",
    "on your computer or even see it in task",
    "manager but it might still be connecting",
    "to websites in the background so I hope",
    "this helps you get started with your",
    "investigating Journey with wi shark you",
    "can try it right now and see what kind",
    "of connections your computer is making",
    "and the best part is you can do this",
    "regardless of whether you're using",
    "Windows Mac or Linux would love to hear",
    "in the comments if you found anything on",
    "your computer that surprised you now",
    "I've obviously been using using this",
    "tool a lot in my past videos so I wanted",
    "to do a quick tutorial so everybody has",
    "these basic skills and can understand",
    "what I'm talking about when I'm using it",
    "like and share this video If you enjoyed",
