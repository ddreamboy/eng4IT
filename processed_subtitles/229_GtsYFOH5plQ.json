  "text": "hi I'm Casey feastler I am an associate\nprofessor of information science at\nUniversity of Colorado Boulder and a lot\nof the research that I do is around\ntechnology ethics and especially\nresearch ethics\nI am part of a big project on Research\nethics for pervasive data in\ncomputational research and that's a lot\nof what I'm talking about today how do\nwe think about research ethics for\ncomputational social science especially\nwhen we are collecting data that is\npublicly available like from social\nmedia\nI'm Casey and uh my training is actually\nin human-centered Computing and law I'm\ngoing to talk very sparingly about law\nbecause as I will say at some point uh\nlaw and ethics are not the same thing\nand we are fortunate when they overlap\n[Music]\num\nso\nI think it's a really great thing that\nwe're starting off uh with the topic of\nEthics because what you really hate is\nto get it at the very end now you've\nbeen learning how to do this for a\ncouple of weeks and here's the stuff you\nshould have been thinking about all\nalong\nsometimes I joke that being someone who\nstudies technology ethics means that I\njust make slides that look like this\nover and over until I retire\num and you will see some of these come\nup again at various points\nwe might start off with is what is\nethics anyway in this context I am not\ngoing to try to answer this question for\nyou at all in fact during the course of\nall of this\nI'm not really here to give you answers\nI'm here to give you questions\nso sometimes people will ask me Casey so\nyou've you've finished teaching ethics\nto the computer science students when\nyou're done with that are they more\nethical\nwhich is a very hard question to answer\nbut I also tend to think of instruction\naround things like ethics\nas not being about creating a more\nethical person but in assuming that you\nall want to do the right thing everyone\nin this room everyone wants to do the\nethical thing right it's that we often\ndon't know how to spot the problems or\nthe issues and sometimes what we should\nactually do about it is a bit elusive\nbut what I'm hoping is that through the\ncourse of this I can give you a lot of\nthings that you should be thinking about\nas you go about your work\nI'm also going to give you a wrong\nanswer to this question though which is\nthat ethics for researchers with the IRB\ntells you you can do\nwhen I say IRB here I mean this is a bit\nof shorthand because I happen to be\nstanding at a university in the United\nStates so an Institutional review board\nis what academic institutions in the\nUnited States use to do ethics review\nyou might see similar things in other\ncountries sometimes they're called\nethics review boards or ethics\ncommittees and in some places there\nisn't this kind of review at all\nbut in the United States specifically\nthe purview of an IRB is very narrow\nright so ethics review at U.S\ninstitutions is about human subjects\nresearch\nand this is defined in federal law\nand human subjects research\nmeans either\ndirectly interacting with a person a\nhuman\nor collecting identifiable private\ninformation\num and or\num a lot of what you'll be talking about\nhere most of the research that you just\nheard about in that introduction would\nnot fall under this definition right\num\nI do a lot of actual human subjects\nresearch interviewing people surveys\nthis sort of thing but I also do uh what\none might consider computational social\nscience or even qualitative\nwork on Trace data I'm going to talk to\nyou actually about some work that I did\nat some point that was analyzing\ncomments on news articles as a data\nsource\nI did not get IRB approval for this\nproject because it does not fall under\nthe the definition of human subjects\nresearch but that doesn't mean that\nthere are no ethical issues with this\nkind of research right so for example\nall of these are are things that made\nheadlines\num we have uh data from dating sites\nYouTube videos uh tweets more dating\nsites uh facial recognition from images\nfound online so these are often the\nkinds of data that you're talking about\nand often we'll hear about research\nsometimes even that Sparks controversy\nand it might not even be immediately\nobvious what the data source is like the\nthe famous gaydar\nstudy out of out of Stanford where they\nuse off-the-shelf facial recognition to\nshow that they could with some accuracy\npredict sexual orientation from a\nphotograph\nokay\nhow did they do that where did the data\ncome from where do you get labeled data\nwith sexual orientation because they\ndidn't ask people right so that data\ncame from a dating site I don't think\nthat it was tender actually\nbut the point is there is a lot of data\nlike this that's just it's just there\nright and you'll be thinking about a lot\nof different sources of data\nand we've seen this kind of research for\nyears now right and when I was finishing\nup my PhD in 2014 2015 we were just\nstarting to think about this stuff like\nI was in a lab\nwhere we talked about research ethics a\nlot and these conversations around like\noh well what about what about the ethics\nof using tweets like we were just\nstarting to have these conversations\nlike less than than 10 years ago\nfrequently right and actually since then\nsince uh starting in 2015 I've been\nrunning\nworkshops at a lot of different\nconferences mostly in computer science\naround research ethics especially\nresearch ethics that falls through these\ncracks of human subjects research so\nespecially like research ethics for\nusing public data\nand we just talk about the same\nquestions over and over again and having\nand and having conversations about\nresearch ethics especially for public\ndata\nwhat is public anyway\num when is or is ever consent\nappropriate what about violations of\nterms of service\nhow do we account for the fact that even\nif we might think this is unreasonable\nmost people don't think that researchers\nare using or using their data what about\nthings like stolen or leaked or deleted\ndata anonymization practices how do we\neven create shared expectations in a\nsingle discipline or 150 disciplines\nwhat kinds of precautions should we be\ntaking for vulnerable populations in\nparticular\nand what are our obligations to those\ncommunities and these are just again\nquestions that I hear over and over and\nI'll address some of these but I don't\nnecessarily have answers\nuh to any of these again but things to\nthink about but one of the big questions\nthat we often start talking about when\nhaving this conversation is okay so I\nwant to do a research project using\nTrace data\nhow do you decide whether it's okay\nfor your definition of okay\nto collect data I hear two answers most\ncommonly when you ask someone this\nquestion the first one\nis well what are the terms of service\nsay\nI'm guessing that some of you might have\nread terms of service at some point\nperhaps even for this exact for this\nexact reason\nI'm going to be talking a little bit\nabout some work now that I did with\nBrian Keegan at my University and Nathan\nbeard who's a PhD student at University\nof Maryland now I want to point out\nsomething real quick before I continue\nthis conversation about terms of service\nwhich is\nlegal and ethical or not the same thing\nI'm actually not going to be talking\nmuch about the legal issues here\num in part because they tend to be less\ninteresting to me and and mostly less\nimportant\nto me\num\nbut for what it's worth\nrecent court cases suggests that it's\nprobably not a Computer Fraud and Abuse\nAct violation to scrape against terms of\nservice I also\num\nperhaps not my not the area of expertise\nthat I am known for now but my\ndissertation was all about copyright law\nI also think that copyright law is not\nthe interesting part of what's Happening\nHere but I'm happy that to talk about uh\nto talk to you guys about fair use in\ncopyright law and that sort of thing\nduring the breaks if if you want to\num but what I want to think about here\nis\nethical issues in violating terms of\nservice so\nfor example if a website says\ndo not do academic research here\nand FetLife which is a social network\nfor Kink and fetishes is the only\nwebsite I've ever seen that has this\nexplicit prohibition and you can imagine\nwhy that might be\nright\nso if we want to talk about the legality\nof violating terms of service this is\nbasically the same as as any other\nwebsite when that might have a\nProhibition on\nunscraping or research\nbut you might think that the ethical\nissues are a little bit different here\nbecause of the very specific prohibition\nfor you as academic researchers\nand you might have seen many Provisions\nthat look just like this right or\nvariations thereon and so as part of a\nresearch project a few years ago we\nanalyzed the data scraping Provisions\nfor over a hundred different social\nmedia and social networking websites\nI use Yik Yak as an example here\nactually because this is a website that\nstarted my interest in this topic\nbecause when I was a PhD student at\nGeorgia Tech Yik Yak was actually based\nin Atlanta we were one of the first\nuniversities to have it\nand we were talking about\nhow interesting it would be to get data\nfrom Yik Yak in my research lab and me\nbeing the buzz kill lawyer I went and\nread the terms of service and I said hey\nyou know technically we're not allowed\nto do this\nand my advisor said well we know them\nwe'll just ask them and they said no\nand then guess who didn't study\nand meanwhile other researchers are\npublishing Yik Yak papers and we're just\nbut I wouldn't use this as an example\nreal quick actually because I think this\nis an interesting one because\nuh if you're not familiar with Yik Yak\nit is a location-based\num ephemeral social networking site it\nwent away for a while and then it came\nback last year uh but it's very very\npopular on college campus and around\n2015.\nAnonymous location-based ephemeral the\ndata goes away\nso you can imagine\nwhy yukak might not want people to be\ncreating Archives of data from a website\nwhere the expectation of the users is\nthat it's going away\nright and this is not the only site\nthat's like that but do they say that\nhere do they say this is why no they\ndon't and they almost never do\num I don't expect you to take any\nmeaning from from this table\num this is a way that we coded all of\nthese different data scraping Provisions\nfor things like whether they prohibited\nuh only automated scraping or manual\nscraping as well or anything and whether\nthey had any kind of like special\nProvisions whether it was just for\npersonal anyway the point of this is\nsuper inconsistent\nif you read the terms of service for\nInstagram that tells you nothing about\nthe terms of service for Yik Yak right\nwhen it comes to data scraping but\nthey're also super vague like\ndon't scrape\nthings that don't matter include\nwhat kind of data for the most part what\nyou're going to do with it who you are\nwhat the expectations of the nor and the\nNorms of the users are are basically all\nof the kinds of things that you think\nmight matter for an ethical decision\nlike what I just mentioned with respect\nto Yik Yak\num\nso that answer to Is it okay for me to\ncollect data here\nif you are making a decision solely\nbased on terms of service\nso if the terms of service prohibit it I\ncannot collect data if the terms of\nservice say nothing about it I can\ncollect data\nthat strategy has two major problems\none is that it assumes that violating\nterms of services inherently unethical\nI would argue that that is not true\nand one of the reasons I say that that I\ndon't think that's true is in part\nbecause\nyou can put whatever you want in a terms\nof service you might in fact put in a\nterms of service anyone can scrape data\nhere\nunless you're an academic researcher and\nyou're going to say bad things about our\nplatform\num\nthere's actually a provision that is\nlike getting very close to saying that\nin parlors in terms of service\num\nand the other thing is that\nthere are some reasons for perhaps the\ngood of society where we might want to\nmake sure that not only\npeople who have\nthe access that data are the only ones\nwho can study it right this conversation\nhas come up a lot with respect to\nFacebook in particular\num\nFacebook is not the only platform for\nwhich this is relevant but we've just\nhad a whole lot of conversations about\nthem in particular\nand there are a lot of amazing\nresearchers at Facebook\na lot of amazing researchers and our\ncommunity who are doing really cool work\nand they're publishing papers\nlots of them and the data that they have\naccess to is amazing\nbut\nthey're still\na company with corporate interests\nand this is true\nfor any platform\nhonestly this is true for if you build a\nnew platform\nwhat's your incentive\nto want to know how that platform harms\nsociety and then tell everyone about it\nI will give some sort of rare kudos to\nuh Twitter\nTwitter did an audit on one of their\nalgorithms a couple of years ago and\npublished a scientific paper about how\nit was biased\nyou don't see that very much right so\nthe argument is that\nwe might want external researchers\nto be able to study\nthe data that comes from platforms to be\nable to look at their impact on society\nEtc and a lot of and and a lot of\nplatforms including Facebook are trying\nto find ways to open up access to data\nin part for that for that reason\nFacebook has run into some problems with\nthis\nmore movement even recently in trying to\nmake this happen and in fact right now\nin the EU there's a proposed law the\nDigital Services act that if passed\nmight require platforms to open up data\nto researchers more\nof course this becomes complicated when\nyou consider that also Facebook in\nparticular has gotten into some hot\nwater when it comes to research\nhappening on their platform and so\nthere's actually a really fine line uh\nto walk here and a lot of the different\nthings that I'm going to talk about\ntoday have these tensions the tension\nfor example between protecting people's\nprivacy and open science would be a\ngreat example\nbut also\nwe don't want to think that violating\nterms of service is the only thing that\ncould make data collection unethical and\nso actually now let's put aside in terms\nof service for the rest of this and and\nthink about these other kinds of things\nso\nthe answer that I actually hear a lot\nmore than talking about terms of service\nas well is the data public\nright these These are the magic words\nwhen it comes to trace data is it public\nso for example\num OkCupid the dating site technically\npublic right\num and in 2016 there was\na big controversy because a researcher\nscraped all of OkCupid and put the data\nset online\nwithout any anonymization\num I don't know if any of you use\nOkCupid or have in the past but the way\nthat the matching algorithm on that site\nworks is that you answer many many many\nmany many questions about yourself\nand from uh what's bigger the Sun or the\nEarth\nkind of question to like extremely\ndetailed question about people's sexual\npreferences\num and at the time people were pointing\nout you know\nyou've got people's usernames here\nyou've got their locations it would not\nbe hard to identify a lot of people in\nthis data set and when called out about\nthis on Twitter the researchers said uh\nbut the data's already public\nand this is such a common response that\nthis was the title of my collaborator\nMichael Zimmer's paper in 2010\nand he has a Google a Google alert set\nfor this phrase\nthe data is already public\nand publicness of data is one of those\nlike get out of IRB free cards right\nand so this is often the sole ethical\nheuristic\nfor using Trace data so now I'm going to\nspend like an hour and a half telling\nyou why that should not be the case\num so\nagain this this paper was written in\n2010 uh you know in early paper about\nthis kind of thing and it was with\nrespect to Facebook uh\neven at that time Facebook data was\npretty hard to get\nbut we started getting data it was much\neasier to get\num\nin 2014 zainab tufeki wrote a paper\nabout social media big data and made a\npoint that I think is very important\nwhich is why do we use Twitter data so\nmuch\nis Twitter so great like is Twitter what\nmost people are using is Twitter the\nrepresentation no\nwe use Twitter data because it's easy to\nget\num and in this paper she talks about\nTwitter as essentially the fruit fly\nof academic research\nthat Twitter has the model organism\nproblem we know people don't study the\nfruit fly because the fruit fly is like\nthe organism that's most like every no\nit like has a really short lifespan so\nit's really easy to study\nsame thing right you know if we were\ngoing to study social media data based\non uh like Global representation we\nwould have thousands and thousands and\nthousands of papers each year using\nFacebook data not Twitter data right but\nTwitter is one of the big ones\nregardless of the reason\num and the point made earlier about how\nthis has some representation issues uh\nis important as well the exclusions of\nBig Data\nbut this is the state of the world I'm\nalso going to talk about Reddit later\nbut in\nuh 2017 when I started doing research in\nthis area Twitter was definitely the big\none and myself and my collaborator Nick\nperferas who's at Arizona State\nUniversity now wanted to answer a pretty\nsimple question which was how do Twitter\nusers feel about this\nbecause we weren't talking about this a\nlot at the time because it wasn't people\nit was just data like a data set of 10\nmillion tweets\nthat's not people it's it's data it's\npublic right so we conducted a survey of\nTwitter users about how they feel about\nthe use of their tweets and research and\nin particular the contextual factors\nthat might influence that now you might\nbe thinking about the totally obvious\nselection bias in this study right\nwe surveyed people about how they feel\nabout research so people had to opt in\nto take a survey we cannot survey people\nwithout their consent\nand when we did the study we're like\nthere is a very good chance that we get\nthe survey results back and everyone's\nlike yeah research is great\num because why would people who hate\nresearch participate in our research\nstudy about how they feel about research\num\nthat wasn't her finding but I bring this\nup because a I want you to realize that\nI recognized the selection bias but B I\nactually think that\nthe attitudes that you're gonna see here\nare better than if we were able to get a\nto get a sample without that kind of\nselection bio so first of all\n61 of the people we surveyed had\nabsolutely no idea this was a thing\num\nand and anecdotally I hear this a lot\nright I talk to people about my research\nthey like I'm like yeah you know I study\nlike research topics of scientists using\ntweets or YouTube videos or Reddit posts\nor whatever and they're like wait what\nwhy would scientists read my tweets\num this might seem obvious to you but\nlike this is a data source but to the\naverage person\nno\num\nwe also asked people well\ndo you think that's allowed\nlike our researchers permitted to use\ntweets without permission and almost\nhalf were like no definitely not they\nmust be breaking some kind of rules here\nand of those people who thought that\nthis has to be against the rules uh 61\nthought thought well they're clearly\nlike breaking some kind of ethical rule\nfor researchers\num it also 23 were like yeah this is\nalso definitely a violation of Twitter's\nterms of service\num and that one's interesting because\nTwitter's uh actually not their terms of\nservice their privacy policy is like hey\njust so you know University researchers\nmight be using your tweets of course\npeople don't read terms of service right\nwhich is another reason why if we're\nthinking about the ethical issues with\nlike following terms of service\nyou can't assume that well their terms\nof service doesn't prohibit research so\ntherefore people must know there's going\nto be research there\num terms of service are not a\nparticularly good proxy for knowledge of\nanything\nbecause people don't read them\nwe also asked people\nwell regardless of\nyou know whether you think it's allowed\nand actually regardless of how you feel\nabout your tweets specifically\nshould researchers be able to do this\num and Moe said no\nactually but more interestingly\nwe asked people to explain\nwhy they felt this way and this is where\nthe contextual factors started to come\nup\nwell does the research serve a greater\npurpose\nwas I told about it\nis it a large-scale study or is it my\nindividual tweet being picked out of\nthis\nright we went into this study not like\nour our question wasn't\nshould researchers use tweet I am not\ngoing to do a study where I tell\nresearchers they can't use tweets like\nif I thought there was any chance that\nwas going to be the answer like I was a\nsecond year Professor I was not going to\ngo that there right\nand actually throughout the course of\nall of this I'm not I'm never suggesting\nthat we should not be doing this kind of\nwork the important thing is how do we do\nit so this is where contextual factors\nbecome really important and I don't\nexpect you to take meaning quickly out\nof this chart but we asked people about\nall these different things like were you\ninformed was it analyzed along with\nmillions of tweets was it a protected\naccount was it deleted was it analyzed\nby a computer program or a person\nthese kinds of things\nand the point of this is that these\nkinds of things matter\nand so let me give you a few examples\nso the purpose of the study is one thing\nthat matters on someone on the previous\nslide said does it serve a greater\npurpose we also saw a number of people\nwho\nwere unhappy that like this this work\nwas probably being done by like evil\nliberal academics\num which I which is a point that I'll\ncome back to later as well so but to\nthese people it mattered who they were\nwho's doing the research\nalso the content of the tweet and this\nseems really obvious\nright\num well is it personal is it\nembarrassing is it identifying what's\nthe tweet\npeople thought about anonymity is it\ntied to their name\nand also issues with\ndissemination\nwell do I get to read the findings of\nthe paper\nwas I\ncredited with my handle in there people\nfeel differently about that as well\num but I think the big Point here\nand this looks similar to a slide that I\nhave a moment ago is that data\ncollection decisions should not be\ncontext agnostic like these things\nmatter what's the data what are you\ngoing to do with it who are you what are\nthe Norms of the users and the big Point\nhere is that all of these things are not\njust publicness\npublicness is a a floor not a ceiling\nwhen it comes to like\nno we do not want to be studying not\npublic data right so an example of this\nwould be like a private health related\nForum where you have to have a login to\nread it uh you're not\nI hopefully think that most people would\nnot think it was okay to just use that\nkind of data without consent like not in\npublic data or like the slack Channel\nfor this institute like just taking the\ndata from that without people's\npermission\nbut if we consider publicness\nas a floor as a bare minimum there are a\nlot of other things we should be\nthinking about as well\num and I'm going to go through a few of\nthese this is not a comprehensive list\nof all of the types of things that you\nmight want to be thinking about but I'm\ngoing to go through a number of things\nthat have come up specifically in my\nresearch and specific cases that I that\nI've heard about so I'm going to go\nthrough a couple of these before before\nwe take a break\nso first of all\nit's important to not think of data as\njust data\nif that data comes from people so I'm\nmostly thinking about social media data\nand the kinds of stuff that I'm talking\nabout here because that's such a common\npiece of Trace data for human behavior\nyou could imagine some other categories\nof data but the important thing here is\nthat it's not all the same\nso here's a tweet\na tweet that I got when searching for\nbreakfast\nand Twitter in 2018 when I first gave a\ntalk like this\num so here's someone tweeting about what\nthey had for breakfast at the time I\nalso looked for some tweets on some\nother topics and another tweet that I\nfound had someone talking about being\nHIV positive\nand I was able to find this by doing a\nsearch for HIV positive in Twitter\nthis is actually an obfuscated tweet\nit's paraphrased I don't even remember\nwhat the original tweet was at this\npoint but why would I even need to use\nthat tweet on a slide\num let alone\npublished in an academic paper where\nsomeone could search for it and find\nthat person again pretty easily\nthe idea that these two tweets are\nequivalent and should be treated exactly\nthe same as absurd\nright these are not the same\nthere are some types of data that\nrequires more care the same would be\ntrue if you were doing human subjects\nresearch right so like I've done many\nmany many many\nprotocols for the IRB from the ethics\nreview board at my University and\nsometimes I do projects where I'm asking\ncomputer science students hey what did\nyou think about this assignment in this\nclass\nuh very recently I've started doing a\nproject about uh type 1 diabetes talking\nto people about very personal Health\nData the Hoops that I have to jump\nthrough for the IRB are different which\nis completely appropriate because some\nkinds of content is more sensitive than\nothers\nso there was a study conducted that was\npublished in 2018 where they looked for\ntweets in PubMed articles so PubMed is\nall medical health published papers\nlots of public health research uses\ntweets\nso 72 percent of the articles that use\nTwitter data quoted tweets directly and\nthey could lead back to the Twitter user\n84 of the time\nand these are tweets about medical stuff\nright these are not what did you have\nfor breakfast\ntweets\num so again these these things are\ndifferent this reminder that data does\ncome from people and here's people\ntalking about their health conditions\nlet me give you another data as people\nexample\num\nthis is from a published paper\nthat is matching these photographs to\nBMI body mass index so there's a data\nset that that was based on helping\nAI to be able to determine BMI from a\nphotograph of just your face\nso in order to do that\nwhat do you need you need photographs of\nfaces\nand you need BMI so there are a couple\nof different ways you could do this one\nyou bring in a bunch of people you ask\nthem their height and weight and you\ntake a photograph of their face and you\ncreate a data set which would be a lot\nof work or you can go to the subreddit\nwhere people are sharing their weight\nloss Journeys and they're saying here's\nmy height and weight and here's my\nphotograph\nright\nso\nI have no idea if the people in the\nsubreddit ever found out about the study\nor have any idea uh that it happened\neven the people who were shown in a\npaper with the bar over their eyes but I\nwant you to think for a minute about the\npeople in this data\nwhy do you share a photograph of\nyourself with your height height and\nweight this is a very vulnerable thing\nto decide to show this to a bunch of\nstrangers on the internet\nand these are often folks who and we\nknow this based on the stories that\nthey're sharing here as well\ndon't even want to talk to their doctors\nabout this people often lie about their\nweight to their doctors\num or you know don't want to be weighed\nor or whatever it's a very vulnerable\nthing to show weight loss photos to\nstrangers on the internet and probably\nweren't expecting\nthat to be used in any other way right\num my understanding is actually that\nthis data set has been removed in part\nbecause of these kinds of\nethical concerns\num\nbut let me give you another example of\nthis kind of thing\nthere were researchers who were\nusing YouTube videos of people sharing\ngender transition stories to train\nfacial recognition\nto be able to\nstill be able to do facial recognition\nfor for gender\num depending on where some where someone\nwas in a gender transition\num and\nthis was a story in Verge about this at\nthe time and this part here particularly\nstruck me so there was someone who's\ntransition picture was in a scientific\npaper just like the example that I just\nshowed you\num and she didn't know about this until\nit came to her attention much later and\ntalked about how it felt like a\nviolation of privacy\num so there was no consent\nuh here but also this is another example\nof\nwhy would someone share this on YouTube\nright\nvery vulnerable you're doing this to\nhelp your community if you're make\nputting up a YouTube video about your\ngender transition you are not doing that\nfor science right\num\nI do think that Norms around these\nthings are changing this is another data\nset that is gone\num this data set was retracted\nagain because in part because of of\nethical concerns and I think these are\nthings that are changing but these are\nreally important examples of remembering\nthe humans in the data\nso I want to talk now a bit about\ninformed consent or rather not informed\nconsent but informing and consenting\num so I'm gonna talk now a little bit\nabout\na particular research ethics controversy\nthat you might have heard about the\nFacebook emotional contagion study\nso this happened in 2014 actually as I\nwas finishing up my PhD and I mentioned\nthat people were starting to talk more\nabout these kinds of things and this was\none of the flash points in the social\nComputing research community that kicked\noff conversations about research ethics\nthat we were not having before\nthe short version of this is that some\nacademic researchers worked with\nresearchers at Facebook and they wanted\nto test the psychological phenomenon of\nemotional contagion which is basically\nif you're around people who are happy\nyou're happier if you're on people who\nare sad you're sadder so the question\nwas does this happen on social media and\nso\nas you all I'm sure know Facebook has an\nalgorithm that is constantly tweaking\nthe kinds of stuff that you see on your\nnews feed so it's just a matter of\nputting people into experimental\nconditions where their news feed was\ntweaked based on sentiment analysis to\nshow uh more positive or less positive\ncontent and then doing that same kind of\nanalysis on what that person posted\nafterwards\nand\nthe initial press release and the first\ncouple of news stories about this was\nresearchers show that emotional\ncontagion happens on social media I mean\nit was a very small effect but it was\nsignificant\nand then\nthe headlines after that were\nFacebook researchers are manipulating\nyou to make you sad\num\nand exercise that you might find useful\nand we'll talk a little bit more about\nthis kind of speculation as I go on in\nthis talk\num\nit was a good idea to imagine\nthe worst possible headline someone\ncould write about your research\nI sometimes have my students do this\num\nnow whether these sort of outcry about\nthis was appropriate or not\nit was an interesting way to look at how\npeople reacting to research so I talked\nabout the selection bias in my study\nearlier how do you find out how people\nfeel about research they don't want to\nparticipate in your research study about\nhow much they hate reading yeah\num so I did my own study of Trace data\nwe wanted to find out what people were\nupset about when it came to this\nparticular study and so we analyzed\ncomments on news articles\nabout it\num and there were a lot of interesting\nfindings here a lot of which aren't\nparticularly relevant to issues of Trace\ndata which is what I'm mostly talking\nabout here but I wanted to bring up one\nthing that came up in our findings that\nI think is relevant generally\nwhich was this idea of\nI didn't come here to be your science\nexperiment\nI'm not on Facebook to jump in a petri\ndish\nI'm not a lab rat\num\nthe findings that we got here and a\nlittle bit out of that survey like I\ngave you the example of like the person\nwho said they didn't want liberal\nacademics studying them\num there are some people who\nfundamentally\ndo not want to be part of your science\nexperiment\nthey do not want their Trace data in\nyour study\nnow I'm not saying this as a way to\nsuggest that this means no more\ncomputational social science using Trace\ndata ever but this is an important thing\nfor you to know\nbecause there are then certain types of\ncontent that you might want to treat\ndifferently or certain ways that you\nmight want to be careful\nto assuage potential\nconcerns that people might have like\nthis\num and in this case\nwe actually saw also a lot of\ndisagreement about how people felt in\nthis case and it was in part because\nthey had different ideas of like what\nFacebook is for and what their\nrelationship is to it\nand also\nto be frank there are just a lot of\npeople who think that Facebook is evil\nand will absolutely ascribe worst\npossible intentions to anything ever\num and again in the survey that we did\nabout Twitter there was a someone who\nsaid like well is this for the greater\ngood right I feel differently if this is\nfor science versus if this is for like\nuh market research or something like\nthat so these kinds of things matter\nas well\nand then of course we have the examples\nof like data where\nsomeone explicitly will not give you\ntheir consent or in this case and this\nis the FetLife data scraping provision\nProvisions again\nthey said you can get consent from the\nplatform\nso I am not going to suggest that anyone\nshould try to get individual consent\nfrom a million people on Twitter\nlike you're going to do public health\nresearch about covet or whatever I'm not\nI am not suggesting that you need to be\ntweeting out a consent form\nto every person in your data set\num but there are some things that you\nmight consider\num if any of you have ever used Reddit\ndata\na thing that you might do is get consent\nfrom the subreddit for example\num this is a message that was posted to\nour drugs\num which was\nuh well actually here they they the\nmoderators on our drugs knew that\nresearch was happening based on their\nsubreddit\nand they basically said we know that\nbecause of reddit's terms of service and\nthe fact that they have an API and all\nthat we can't stop you\nfrom scraping data\nbut we would really ask that you\nannounced yourself\nto the moderators\nbecause it's the right thing to do\nethically now\nthis is something that someone could do\nanywhere\nthere there are some subreddits also\nthat just say don't research us\nand you might be thinking also but what\nif I ask the moderators and they say no\nand the question you might ask yourself\nis why do they say no\nright so this goes back to the sort of\nlike legal versus ethical thing\num and then you might ask yourself well\nbut what if I want to do it anyway\nand then the question I would ask you is\nwhy\nso something that I want you to be\nthinking about sort of throughout all of\nthis\nand in some ways this is a simplistic\nway of thinking about research ethics\nbut it's appropriate\num\nharm versus benefit\nthere's a lot of research\nthat people do\nbecause it's never been done before\nhave any of you ever\nreviewed a paper where that's literally\nthe only justification\nfor the project at all like there's\nabsolutely nothing about why this should\nbe done except we are the first to do X\nthere are a lot of things that haven't\nbeen done because they're not worth\ndoing\num and there is research that absolutely\nmight have benefit that might outweigh\nsomething\num like the comfort of the people who\nare being studied\nan example I might give actually is\nlooking at arguably like toxic\ncommunities\nso there are a lot of people who do\nresearch on say\nexplicitly racist online communities\nCommunity there used to be I mean I\nthink they're mostly gone now\ngo Reddit but like there were subreddits\nthat were explicitly devoted\nto racism and misogyny and fat shaming\nand these sorts of things\nthere might legitimately be really\nimportant things that we need to learn\nabout these kinds of interactions and if\nthey are happening publicly\nI think that you can make\num a benefit versus harm analysis in\npart because\nif this were not our drugs if this were\none of those communities\na researcher\nmight be actively putting themselves in\ndanger\nby telling the community right but in\nthese cases you need to be thinking\nabout the benefits and you need to be\nthinking about the way that you're doing\nthe research and we'll talk about some\nof those things as well I think we have\nall right I have one more Point\num on this topic and then we're going to\ntake a break before I go into some more\nthings\nthis was another Finding from the\nTwitter study\nwe asked people what would you want to\nknow if your Tweet was in a research\nstudy and the answer is yes most people\nwant to know and 83 percent of people\nsaid they'd want to read the paper now\nis this actually true would they really\nwant to read the paper Maybe\num\nbut this is an interesting point\ninform and consent are not the same\nthing\nyou can potentially inform people\nwithout consenting them\nand again I don't necessarily mean\nyou know contacting sending an email to\neveryone who's in your data set of a\nmillion tweets\nbut let's say for example you study a\nsubreddit\nyou could post the paper in that\nsubreddit when you're done with it again\nif it's not going to be something that's\ngoing to put you in in danger or or\nsomething like that\nor you might\ntweet to a hashtag\none of my PhD students did a study at\nblack Twitter recently\ntweeted about it to the black Twitter\nhashtag I write I have done a bunch of\nstudies of fandom I write Tumblr posts\nabout them I've made tick talks about\nresearch\nwe very often study communities without\ngiving anything back to them at all not\neven the knowledge that we gained from\nthat community\num\nand I will talk more about that a bit\nagain later\nfrom\none of the most important things is to\nbe thinking about it at all\nsometimes this means\nspeculating about possible harms\nthinking through the kinds of questions\nthat I just took you all through\nand also writing about your ethical\nconsiderations when for example you\npublish a paper this is also how we\nlearn from each other if you want to\nlearn more about my work and the work\nfor my collaborators you can find out\nmore about the pervade pervasive ethics\nfor computational research project and\nalso I am of course all over social\nmedia so that everyone can study my\ntweets you can find me on Twitter at\ncfisler and on Tick Tock at Professor\nCasey\nforeign\n[Music]\n",
