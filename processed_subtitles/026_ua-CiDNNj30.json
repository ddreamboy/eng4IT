  "text": "Welcome to Data Science: An Introduction.\nI'm Barton Poulson and what we are going to\ndo in this course is We are going to have\na brief, accessible and non-technical overview\nof the field of Data Science. Now, some people\nwhen they hear Data Science, they start thinking\nthings like: Data and think about piles of\nequations and numbers and then throw on top\nof that Science and think about people working\nin their lab and they start to say eh, that's\nnot for me. I'm not really a technical person\nand that just seems much too techy. Well,\nhere's the important thing to know. While\na lot of people get really fired up about\nthe technical aspects of Data Science the\nimportant thing is that Data Science is not\nso much a technical discipline, but creative.\nAnd, really, that's true. The reason I say\nthat is because in Data Science you use tools\nthat come from coding and statistics and from\nmath But you use those to work creatively\nwith data. The idea is there's always more\nthan one way to solve a problem or answer\na question But most importantly to get insight\nBecause the goal, no matter how you go about\nit, is to get insight from your data. and\nwhat makes Data Science unique, compared to\nso many other things is that you try to listen\nto all of your data, even when it doesn't\nfit in easily with your standard approaches\nand paradigms you're trying to be much more\ninclusive in your analysis and the reason\nyou want to do that is because everything\nsignifies. everything carries meaning and\neverything can give you additional understanding\nand insight into what's going on around you\nand so in this course what we are trying to\ndo is give you a map to the field of Data\nScience and how you can use it and so now\nyou have the map in your hands and you can\nget ready to get going with Data Science.\nWelcome back to Data Science: An Introduction.\nAnd we're going to begin this course by defining\ndata science. That makes sense. But, we are\ngoing to be doing it in kind of a funny way.\nThe first thing I am going to talk about is\nthe demand for data science. So, let's take\na quick look. Now, data science can be defined\nin a few ways. I am going to give you some\nshort definitions. Take one on my definition\nis that data science is coding, math, and\nstatistics in applied settings. That's a reasonable\nworking definition. But, if you want to be\na little more concise, I've got take two on\na definition. That data science is the analysis\nof diverse data, or data that you didn't think\nwould fit into standard analytic approaches.\nA third way to think about it is that data\nscience is inclusive analysis. It includes\nall of the data, all of the information that\nyou have, in order to get the most insightful\nand compelling answer to your research questions.\nNow, you may say to yourself, \"Wait... that's\nit?\" Well, if you're not impressed, let me\nshow you a few things. First off, let's take\na look at this article. It says, \"Data Scientist:\nthe Sexiest Job of the 21st Century.\" And\nplease note, this is coming from Harvard Business\nReview. So, this is an authoritative source\nand it is the official source of this saying:\nthat data science is sexy! Now, again, you\nmay be saying to yourself, \"Sexy? I hardly\nthink so.\" Oh yeah, it's sexy. And the reason\ndata science is sexy is because first, it\nhas rare qualities, and second it has high\ndemand. Let me say a little more about those.\nThe rare qualities are that data science takes\nunstructured data, then finds order, meaning,\nand value in the data. Those are important,\nbut they're not easy to come across. Second,\nhigh demand. Well, the reason it's in high\ndemand is because data science provides insight\ninto what's going on around you and critically,\nit provides competitive advantage, which is\na huge thing in business settings. Now, let\nme go back and say a little more about demand.\nLet's take a look at a few other sources.\nSo, for instance the McKinsey Global Institute\npublished a very well-known paper, and you\ncan get it with this URL. And if you go to\nthat webpage, this is what's going to come\nup. And we're going to take a quick look at\nthis one, the executive summary. It's a PDF\nthat you can download. And if you open that\nup, you will find this page. And let's take\na look at the bottom right corner. Two numbers\nhere, I'm going to zoom in on those. The first\none, is they are projecting a need in the\nnext few years for somewhere between 140 and\n190,000 deep analytical talent positions.\nSo, this means actual practicing data scientists.\nThat's a huge number; but almost ten times\nas high is 1.5 million more data-savvy managers\nwill be needed to take full advantage of big\ndata in the United States. Now, that's people\nwho aren't necessarily doing the analysis\nbut have to understand it, who have to speak\ndata. And that's one of the main purposes\nof this particular course, is to help people\nwho may or may not be the practicing data\nscientists learn to understand what they can\nget out of data, and some of the methods used\nto get there. Let's take a look at another\narticle from LinkedIn. Here is a shortcut\nURL for it and that will bring you to this\nwebpage: \"The 25 hottest job skills that got\npeople hired in 2014.\" And take a look at\nnumber one here: statistical analysis and\ndata mining, very closely related to data\nscience. And just to be clear, this was number\none in Australia, and Brazil, and Canada,\nand France, and India, and the Netherlands,\nand South Africa, and the United Arab Emirates,\nand the United Kingdom. Everywhere. And if\nyou need a little more, let's take a look\nat Glassdoor, which published an article this\nyear, 2016, and it's about the \"25 Best Jobs\nin America.\" And look at number one right\nhere, it's data scientist. And we can zoom\non this information. It says there is going\nto be 1,700 job openings, with a median base\nsalary of over $116,000, and fabulous career\nopportunities and job scores. So, if you want\nto take all of this together, the conclusion\nyou can reach is that data science pays. And\nI can show you a little more about that. So\nfor instance, here's a list of the top ten\nhighest paying salaries that I got from US\nNews. We have physicians (or doctors), dentists,\nand lawyers, and so on. Now, if we add data\nscientist to this list, using data from O'Reilly.com,\nwe have to push things around. And goes in\nthird with an average total salary (not the\nbase we had in the other one, but the total\ncompensation) of about $144,000 a year. That's\nextraordinary. So in sum, what do we get from\nall this? First off, we learn that there is\na very high demand for data science. Second,\nwe learn that there is a critical need for\nboth specialists; those are the sort of practicing\ndata scientists; and for Generalists, the\npeople who speak the language and know what\ncan be done. And of course, excellent pay.\nAnd all together, this makes Data Science\na compelling career alternative and a way\nof making you better at whatever you are doing.\nBack here in data science, we're going to\ncontinue our attempt to define data science\nby looking at something that's really well\nknown in the field; the Data Science Venn\nDiagram. Now if you want to, you can think\nof this in terms of, \"What are the ingredients\nof data science?\" Well, we're going to first\nsay thanks to Drew Conway, the guy who came\nup with this. And if you want to see the original\narticle, you can go to this address. But,\nwhat Drew said is that data science is made\nof three things. And we can put them as overlapping\ncircles because it is the intersection that's\nimportant. Here on the top left is coding\nor computer programming, or as he calls it:\nhacking. On the top right is stats or, stats\nor mathematics, or quantitative abilities\nin general. And on the bottom is domain expertise,\nor intimate familiarity with a particular\nfield of practice: business, or health, or\neducation, or science, or something like that.\nAnd the intersection here in the middle, that\nis data science. So it's the combination of\ncoding and statistics and math and domain\nknowledge. Now, let's say a little more about\ncoding. The reason coding is important is\nbecause it helps you gather and prepare the\ndata. Because a lot of the data comes from\nnovel sources and is not necessarily ready\nfor you to gather and it can be in very unusual\nformats. And so coding is important because\nit can require some real creativity to get\nthe data from the sources to put it into your\nanalysis. Now, a few kinds of coding that\nare important; for instance, there is statistical\ncoding. A couple of major languages in this\nare R and Python. Two open-source free programming\nlanguages. R, specifically for data. Python\nis general-purpose, but well adapted to data.\nThe ability to work with databases is important\ntoo. The most common language there is SQL,\nusually pronounced \"Sequel,\" which stands\nfor Structured Query Language, because that's\nwhere the data is. Also, there is the command\nline interface, or if you are on a Mac, people\njust call it \"the terminal.\" Most common language\nthere is Bash, which actually stands for Bourne-again\nshell. And then searching is important and\nregex, or regular expressions. While there\nis not a huge amount to learn there (it's\na small little field), it's sort of like super-powered\nwildcard searching that makes it possible\nfor you to both find the data and reformat\nit in ways that are going to be helpful for\nyour analysis. Now, let's say a few things\nabout the math. You're going to need things\nlike a little bit of probability, some algebra,\nof course, regression (very common statistical\nprocedure). Those things are important. And\nthe reason you need the math is: because that\nis going to help you choose the appropriate\nprocedures to answer the question with the\ndata that you have. And probably even more\nimportantly; it is going to help you diagnose\nproblems when things don't go as expected.\nAnd given that you are trying to do new things\nwith new data in new ways, you are probably\ngoing to come across problems. So the ability\nto understand the mechanics of what is going\non is going to give you a big advantage. And\nthe third element of the data science Venn\nDiagram is some sort of domain expertise.\nThink of it as expertise in the field that\nyou're in. Business settings are common. You\nneed to know about the goals of that field,\nthe methods that are used, and the constraints\nthat people come across. And it's important\nbecause whatever your results are, you need\nto be able to implement them well. Data science\nis very practical and is designed to accomplish\nsomething. And your familiarity with a particular\nfield of practice is going to make it that\nmuch easier and more impactful when you implement\nthe results of your analysis. Now, let's go\nback to our Venn Diagram here just for a moment.\nBecause this is a Venn, we also have these\nintersections of two circles at a time. At\nthe top is machine learning. At the bottom\nright is traditional research. And on the\nbottom left hand is what Drew Conway called,\n\"the danger zone.\" Let me talk about each\nof these. First off, machine learning, or\nML. Now, you think about machine learning\nand the idea here is that it represents coding,\nor statistical programming and mathematics,\nwithout any real domain expertise. Sometimes\nthese are referred to as \"black box\" models.\nThey kind of throw data in and you don't even\nnecessarily have to know what it means or\nwhat language it is in, and it will just kind\nof crunch through it all and it will give\nyou some regularities. That can be very helpful,\nbut machine learning is considered slightly\ndifferent from data science because it doesn't\ninvolve the particular applications in a specific\ndomain. Also, there's traditional research.\nThis is where you have math or statistics\nand you have domain knowledge; often very\nintensive domain knowledge but without the\ncoding or programming. Now, you can get away\nwith that because the data that you use in\ntraditional research is highly structured.\nIt comes in rows and columns, and is typically\ncomplete and is typically ready for analysis.\nDoesn't mean your life is easy, because now\nyou have to expand an enormous amount of effort\nin the methods and the designing of the project\nand the interpretation of the data. So, still\nvery heavy intellectual cognitive work, but\nit comes from a different place. And then\nfinally, there is what Conway called, \"the\ndanger zone.\" And that's the intersection\nof coding and domain knowledge, but without\nmath or statistics. Now he says it is unlikely\nto happen, and that is probably true. On the\nother hand, I can think of some common examples,\nwhat are called \"word counts,\" where you take\na large document or a series of documents,\nand you count how many times a word appears\nin there. That can actually tell you some\nvery important things. And also, drawing maps\nand showing how things change across place\nand maybe even across time. You don't necessarily\nhave to have the math, but it can be very\ninsightful and helpful. So, let's think about\na couple of backgrounds where people come\nfrom here. First, is coding. You can have\npeople who are coders, who can do math, stats,\nand business. So, you get the three things\n(and this is probably the most common), most\nthe people come from a programming background.\nOn the other hand, there is also stats, or\nstatistics. And you can get statisticians\nwho can code and who also can do business.\nThat's less common, but it does happen. And\nfinally, there is people who come into data\nscience from a particular domain. And these\nare, for instance, business people who can\ncode and do numbers. And they are the least\ncommon. But, all of these are important to\ndata science. And so in sum, here is what\nwe can take away. First, several fields make\nup Data Science. Second, diverse skills and\nbackgrounds are important and they are needed\nin data science. And third, there are many\nroles involved because there are a lot of\ndifferent things that need to happen. We'll\nsay more about that in our next movie. The\nnext step in our data science introduction\nand our definition of data science is to talk\nabout the Data Science Pathway. So I like\nto think of this as, when you are working\non a major project, you have got to do one\nstep at a time to get it from here to there.\nIn data science, you can take the various\nsteps and you can put them into a couple of\ngeneral categories. First, there are the steps\nthat involve planning. Second, there's the\ndata prep. Third, there's the actual modeling\nof the data. And fourth, there's the follow-up.\nAnd there are several steps within each of\nthese; I'll explain each of them briefly.\nFirst, let's talk about planning. The first\nthing that you need to do, is you need to\ndefine the goals of your project so you know\nhow to use your resources well, and also so\nyou know when you are done. Second, you need\nto organize your resources. So you might have\ndata from several different sources; you might\nhave different software packages, you might\nhave different people. Which gets us to the\nthird one: you need to coordinate the people\nso they can work together productively. If\nyou are doing a hand-off, it needs to be clear\nwho is going to do what and how their work\nis going to go together. And then, really\nto state the obvious, you need to schedule\nthe project so things can move along smoothly\nand you can finish in a reasonable amount\nof time. Next is the data prep, where you\nare taking like food prep and getting the\nraw ingredients ready. First of course, is\nyou need to get the data. And it can from\nmany different sources and be in many different\nformats. You need to clean the data and, the\nsad thing is, this tends to be a very large\npart of any data science project. And that\nis because you are bringing in unusual data\nfrom a lot of different places. You also want\nto explore the data; that is, really see what\nit looks like, how many people are in each\ngroup, what the shape of the distributions\nare like, what is associated with what. And\nyou may need to refine the data. And that\nmeans choosing variables to include, choosing\ncases to include or exclude, making any transformations\nto the data you need to do. And of course\nthese steps kind of can bounce back and forth\nfrom one to the other. The third group is\nmodeling or statistical modeling. This is\nwhere you actually want to create the statistical\nmodel. So for instance, you might do a regression\nanalysis or you might do a neural network.\nBut, whatever you do, once you create your\nmodel, you have to validate the model. You\nmight do that with a holdout validation. You\nmight do it really with a very small replication\nif you can. You also need to evaluate the\nmodel. So, once you know that the model is\naccurate, what does it actually mean and how\nmuch does it tell you? And then finally, you\nneed to refine the model. So, for instance,\nthere may be variables you want to throw out;\nmaybe additional ones you want to include.\nYou may want to, again, transform some of\nthe data. You may want to get it so it is\neasier to interpret and apply. And that gets\nus to the last part of the data science pathway.\nAnd that's follow up. And once you have created\nyour model, you need to present the model.\nBecause it is usually work that is being done\nfor a client, could be in house, could be\na third party. But you need to take the insights\nthat you got and share them in a meaningful\nway with other people. You also need to deploy\nthe model; it is usually being done in order\nto accomplish something. So, for instance,\nif you are working with an e-commerce site,\nyou may be developing a recommendation engine\nthat says, \"people who bought this and this\nmight buy this.\" You need to actually stick\nit on the website and see if it works the\nway that you expected it to. Then you need\nto revisit the model because a lot of the\ntimes, the data that you worked on is not\nnecessarily all of the data, and things can\nchange when you get out in the real world\nor things just change over time. So, you have\nto see how well your model is working. And\nthen, just to be thorough, you need to archive\nthe assets, document what you have, and make\nit possible for you or for others to repeat\nthe analysis or develop off of it in the future.\nSo, those are the general steps of what I\nconsider the data science pathway. And in\nsum, what we get from this is three things.\nFirst, data science isn't just a technical\nfield, it is not just coding. Things like,\nplanning and presenting and implementing are\njust as important. Also, contextual skills,\nknowing how it works in a particular field,\nknowing how it will be implemented, those\nskills matter as well. And then, as you got\nfrom this whole thing, there are a lot of\nthings to do. And if you go one step at a\ntime, there will be less backtracking and\nyou will ultimately be more productive in\nyour data science projects. We'll continue\nour definition of data science by looking\nat the roles that are involved in data science.\nThe way that different people can contribute\nto it. That's because it tends to be a collaborative\nthing, and it's nice to be able to say that\nwe are all together, working together towards\na single goal. So, let's talk about some of\nthe roles involved in data science and how\nthey contribute to the projects. First off,\nlet's take a look at engineers. These are\npeople who focus on the back end hardware.\nFor instance, the servers and the software\nthat runs them. This is what makes data science\npossible, and it includes people like developers,\nsoftware developers, or database administrators.\nAnd they provide the foundation for the rest\nof the work. Next, you can also have people\nwho are Big Data specialists. These are people\nwho focus on computer science and mathematics,\nand they may do machine learning algorithms\nas a way of processing very large amounts\nof data. And they often create what are called\ndata products. So, a thing that tells you\nwhat restaurant to go to, or that says, \"you\nmight know these friends,\" or provides ways\nof linking up photos. Those are data products,\nand those often involve a huge amount of very\ntechnical work behind them. There are also\nresearchers; these are people who focus on\ndomain-specific research. So, for instance,\nphysics, or genetics, or whatever. And these\npeople tend to have very strong statistics,\nand they can use some of the procedures and\nsome of the data that comes from the other\npeople like the big data researchers, but\nthey focus on the specific questions. Also\nin the data science realm, you will find analysts.\nThese are people who focus on the day-to-day\ntasks of running a business. So for instance,\nthey might do web analytics (like Google analytics),\nor they might pull data from a SQL database.\nAnd this information is very important and\ngood for business. So, analysts are key to\nthe day-to-day function of business, but they\nmay not be, exactly be Data Science proper,\nbecause most of the data they are working\nwith is going to be pretty structured. Nevertheless,\nthey play a critical role in business in general.\nAnd then, speaking of business. You have the\nactual business people; the men and women\nwho organize and run businesses. These people\nneed to be able to frame business-relevant\nquestions that can be answered with the data.\nAlso, the business person manages the project\nand the efforts and the resources of others.\nAnd while they may not actually be doing the\ncoding, they must speak data; they must know\nhow the data works, what it can answer, and\nhow to implement it. You can also have entrepreneurs.\nSo, you might have a data startup; they are\nstarting their own little social network,\ntheir own little web search platform. An entrepreneur\nneeds data and business skills. And truthfully,\nthey have to be creative at every step along\nthe way. Usually because they are doing it\nall themselves at a smaller scale. Then we\nhave in data science something known as \"the\nfull stack unicorn.\" And this is a person\nwho can do everything at an expert level.\nThey are called a unicorn because truthfully,\nthey may not actually exist. I will have more\nto say about that later. But for right now,\nwe can sum up what we got out of this video\nby three things. Number one, data science\nis diverse. There's a lot of different people\nwho go into it, and they have different goals\nfor their work, and they bring in different\nskills and different experiences and different\napproaches. Also, they tend to work in very\ndifferent contexts. An entrepreneur works\nin a very different place from a business\nmanager, who works in a very different place\nfrom an academic researcher. But, all of them\nare connected in some way to data science\nand make it a richer field. The last thing\nI want to say in \"Data Science: An Introduction\"\nwhere I am trying to define data science,\nis to talk about teams in data science. The\nidea here is that data science has many different\ntools, and different people are going to be\nexperts in each one of them. Now, you have,\nfor instance, coding and you have statistics.\nAlso, you have what feels like design, or\nbusiness and management that are involved.\nAnd the question, of course, is: \"who can\ndo all of it? Who's able to do all of these\nthings at the level that we need?\" Well, that's\nwhere we get this saying (I have mentioned\nit before), it's the unicorn. And just like\nin ancient history, the unicorn is a mythical\ncreature with magical abilities. In data science,\nit works a little differently. It is a mythical\nData Scientist with universal abilities. The\ntrouble is, as we know from the real world,\nthere are really no unicorns (animals), and\nthere are really not very many unicorns in\ndata science. Really, there are just people.\nAnd so we have to find out how we can do the\nprojects even though we don't have this one\nperson who can do everything for everybody.\nSo let's take a hypothetical case, just for\na moment. I am going to give you some fictional\npeople. Here is my fictional person Otto,\nwho has strong visualization skills, who has\ngood coding, but has limited analytic or statistical\nability. And if we graph his stuff out, his\nabilities... So, here we have five things\nthat we need to have happen. And for the project\nto work, they all have to happen at least,\na level of eight on the zero-to-ten. If we\ntake his coding ability, he is almost there.\nStatistics, not quite halfway. Graphics, yes\nhe can do that. And then, business, eh, alright.\nAnd project, pretty good. So, what you can\nsee here is, in only one of these five areas\nis Otto sufficient on his own. On the other\nhand, let's pair him up with somebody else.\nLet's take a look at Lucy. And Lucy has strong\nbusiness training, has good tech skills, but\nhas limited graphics. And if we get her profile\non the same thing that we saw, there is coding,\npretty good. Statistics, pretty good. Graphics,\nnot so much. Business, good. And projects,\nOK. Now, the important thing here is that\nwe can make a team. So let's take our two\nfictional people, Otto and Lucy, and we can\nput together their abilities. Now, I actually\nhave to change the scale here a little bit\nto accommodate the both of them. But our criterion\nstill is at eight; we need a level of eight\nin order to do the project competently. And\nif we combine them: oh look, coding is now\npast eight. Statistics is past eight. Graphics\nis way past. Business way past. And then the\nprojects, they are too. So when we combine\ntheir skills, we are able to get the level\nthat we need for everything. Or to put it\nanother way, we have now created a unicorn\nby team, and that makes it possible to do\nthe data science project. So, in sum: you\nusually can't do data science on your own.\nThat's a very rare individual. Or more specifically:\npeople need people, and in data science you\nhave the opportunity to take several people\nand make collective unicorns, so you can get\nthe insight that you need in your project\nand you can get the things done that you want.\nIn order to get a better understanding of\ndata science, it can be helpful to look at\ncontrasts between data science and other fields.\nProbably the most informative is with Big\nData because these two terms are actually\noften confused. It makes me think of situations\nwhere you have two things that are very similar,\nbut not the same. Like we have here in the\nPiazza San Carlo here in Italy. Part of the\nproblem stems from the fact that data science\nand big data both have Venn Diagrams associated\nwith them. So, for instance, Venn number one\nfor data science is something we have seen\nalready. We have three circles and we have\ncoding and we have math and we have some domain\nexpertise, that put together get data science.\nOn the other hand, Venn Diagram number two\nis for Big Data. It also has three circles.\nAnd we have the high volume of data, the rapid\nvelocity of data, and the extreme variety\nof data. Take those three v's together and\nyou get Big Data. Now, we can also combine\nthese two if we want in a third Venn Diagram,\nwe call Big Data and Data Science. This time\nit is just two circles. With Big Data on the\nleft and Data Science on the right. And the\nintersection in the middle, there is Big Data\nScience, which actually is a real term. But,\nif you want to do a compare and contrast,\nit kind of helps to look at how you can have\none without the other. So, let's start by\nlooking at Big Data without Data Science.\nSo, these are situations where you may have\nthe volume or velocity or variety of data\nbut don't need all the tools of data science.\nSo, we are just looking at the left side of\nthe equation right now. Now, truthfully, this\nonly works if you have Big Data without all\nthree V's. Some say you have to have the volume,\nvelocity, and variety for it to count as Big\nData. I basically say anything that doesn't\nfit into a standard machine is probably Big\nData. I can think of a couple of examples\nhere of things that might count as Big Data,\nbut maybe don't count as Data Science. Machine\nlearning, where you can have very large data\nsets and probably very complex, doesn't require\nvery much domain expertise, so that may not\nbe data science. Word counts, where you have\nan enormous amount of data and it's actually\na pretty simple analysis, again doesn't require\nmuch sophistication in terms of quantitative\nskills or even domain expertise. So, maybe/maybe\nnot data science. On the other hand, to do\nany of these you are going to need to have\nat least two skills. You are going to need\nto have the coding and you will probably have\nto have some sort of quantitative skills as\nwell. So, how about data science without Big\nData? That's the right side of this diagram.\nWell, to make that happen you are probably\ntalking about data with just one of the three\nV's from Big Data. So, either volume or velocity\nor variety, but singly. So for instance, genetics\ndata. You have a huge amount of data and it\ncomes in very set structure and it tends to\ncome in at once. So, you have got a lot of\nvolume and it is a very challenging thing\nto work with. You have to use data science,\nbut it may or may not count as Big Data. Similarly,\nstreaming sensor data, where you have data\ncoming in very quickly, but you are not necessarily\nsaving it; you are just looking at these windows\nin it. That is a lot of velocity, and it is\ndifficult to deal with, and it takes Data\nScience, the full skill set, but it may not\nrequire Big Data, per se. Or facial recognition,\nwhere you have enormous variety in the data\nbecause you are getting photos or videos that\nare coming in. Again, very difficult to deal\nwith, requires a lot of ingenuity and creativity\nmay or may not count as Big Data, depending\non how much of a stickler you are about definitions.\nNow, if you want to combine the two, we can\ntalk about Big Data Science. In that case,\nwe are looking right here at the middle. This\nis a situation where you have volume, and\nvelocity, and variety in your data and truthfully,\nif you have the three of those, you are going\nto need the full Data Science skill set. You\nare going to need coding, and statistics,\nand math, and you are going to have to have\ndomain expertise. Primarily because of the\nvariety you are dealing with, but taken all\ntogether you do have to have all of it. So\nin sum, here is what we get. Big Data is not\nequal to, it is not identical to data science.\nNow, there is common ground, and a lot of\npeople who are good at Big Data are good at\ndata science and vice versa, but they are\nconceptually distinct. On the other hand,\nthere is the shared middle ground of Big Data\nScience that unifies the two separate fields.\nAnother important contrast you can make in\ntrying to understand data science is to compare\nit with coding or computer programming. Now,\nthis is where you are trying to work with\nmachines and you are trying to talk to that\nmachine, to get it to do things. In one sense\nyou can think of coding as just giving task\ninstructions; how to do something. It is a\nlot like a recipe when you're cooking. You\nget some sort of user input or other input,\nand then maybe you have if/then logic, and\nyou get output from it. To take an extremely\nsimple example, if you are programming in\nPython version 2, you write: print, and then\nin quotes, \"Hello, world!\" will put the words\n\"Hello, world!\" on the screen. So, you gave\nit some instructions and it gave you some\noutput. Very simple programming. Now, coding\nand data gets a little more complicated. So,\nfor instance, there is word counts, where\nyou take a book or a whole collection of books,\nyou take the words and you count how many\nthere are in there. Now, this is a conceptually\nsimple task, and domain expertise and really\nmath and statistics are not vital. But to\nmake valid inferences and generalizations\nin the face of variability and uncertainty\nin the data you need statistics, and by extension,\nyou need data science. It might help to compare\nthe two by looking at the tools of the respective\ntrades. So for instance, there are tools for\ncoding or generic computer programming, and\nthere are tools that are specific for data\nscience. So, what I have right here is a list\nfrom the IEEE of the top ten programming languages\nof 2015. And it starts at Java and C and goes\ndown to Shell. And some of these are also\nused for data science. So for instance, Python\nand R and SQL are used for data science, but\nthe other ones aren't major ones in data science.\nSo, let's, in fact, take a look at a different\nlist of most popular tools for data science\nand you see that things move around a little\nbit. Now, R is at the top, SQL is there, Python\nis there, but for me what is the most interesting\non the list is that Excel is number five,\nwhich would never be considered programming,\nper se, but it is, in fact, a very important\ntool for data science. And that is one of\nthe ways that we can compare and contrast\ncomputer programming with data science. In\nsum, we can say this: data science is not\nequal to coding. They are different things.\nOn the other hand, they share some of the\ntools and they share some practices specifically\nwhen coding for data. On the other hand, there\nis one very big difference in that statistics,\nstatistical ability is one of the major separators\nbetween general purpose programming and data\nscience programming. When we talk about data\nscience and we are contrasting with some fields,\nanother field that a lot of people get confused\nand think they are the same thing is data\nscience and statistics. Now, I will tell you\nthere is a lot in common, but we can talk\na little bit about the different focuses of\neach. And we also get into the issue of definitionalism\nthat data science is different because we\ndefine it differently, even when there is\nan awful lot in common between the two. It\nhelps to take a look at some of the things\nthat go on in each field. So, let's start\nhere about statistics. Put a little circle\nhere and we will put data science. And, to\nborrow a term from Steven J. Gould, we can\ncall these non-overlapping magisteria; NOMA.\nSo, you think of them as separate fields that\nare sovereign unto themselves with nothing\nto do with each other. But, you know, that\ndoesn't seem right; and part of that is that\nif we go back to the Data Science Venn Diagram,\nstatistics is one part of it. There it is\nin the top corner. So, now what do we do?\nWhat's the relationship? So, it doesn't make\nsense to say these are totally separate areas,\nmaybe data science and statistics because\nthey share procedures, maybe data science\nis a subset or specialty of statistics, more\nlike this. But, if data science were just\na subset or specialty within statistics then\nit would follow that all data scientists would\nfirst be statisticians. And interestingly\nthat's just not so. Say, for instance, we\ntake a look at the data science stars, the\nsuperstars in the field. We go to a rather\nintimidating article; it's called \"The World's\n7 Most Powerful Data Scientists\" from Forbes.com.\nYou can see the article if you go to this\nURL. There's actually more than seven people,\nbecause sometimes he brings them up in pairs.\nLet's check their degrees, see what their\nacademic training is in. If we take all the\npeople on this list, we have five degrees\nin computer science, three in math, two in\nengineering, and one each in biology, economics,\nlaw, speech pathology, and one in statistics.\nAnd so that tells us, of course, these major\npeople in data science are not trained as\nstatisticians. Only one of them has formal\ntraining in that. So, that gets us to the\nnext question. Where do these two fields,\nstatistics and data science, diverge? Because\nthey seem like they should have a lot in common,\nbut they don't have a lot in training. Specifically,\nwe can look at the training. Most data scientists\nare not trained, formally, as statisticians.\nAlso, in practice, things like machine learning\nand big data, which are central to data science,\nare not shared, generally, with most of statistics.\nSo, they have separate domains there. And\nthen there is the important issue of context.\nData scientists tend to work in different\nsettings than statisticians. Specifically,\ndata scientists very often work in commercial\nsettings where they are trying to get recommendation\nengines or ways of developing a product that\nwill make them money. So, maybe instead of\nhaving data science a subset of statistics,\nwe can think of it more as these two fields\nhave different niches. They both analyze data,\nbut they do different things in different\nways. So, maybe it is fair to say they share,\nthey overlap, they have analysis in common\nof data, but otherwise, they are ecologically\ndistinct. So, in sum: what we can say here\nis that data science and statistics both use\ndata and they analyze it. But the people in\neach tend to come from different backgrounds,\nand they tend to function with different goals\nand contexts. And in that way, render them\nto be conceptually distinct fields despite\nthe apparent overlap. As we work to get a\ngrasp on data science, there is one more contrast\nI want to make explicitly, and that is between\ndata science and business intelligence, or\nBI. The idea here is that business intelligence\nis data in real life; it's very, very applied\nstuff. The purpose of BI is to get data on\ninternal operations, on market competitors,\nand so on, and make justifiable decisions\nas opposed to just sitting in the bar and\ndoing whatever comes to your mind. Now, data\nscience is involved with this, except, you\nknow, really there is no coding in BI. There's\nusing apps that already exist. And the statistics\nin business intelligence tend to be very simple,\nthey tend to be counts and percentages and\nratios. And so, it's simple, the light bulb\nis simple; it just does its one job there\nis nothing super sophisticated there. Instead\nthe focus in business intelligence is on domain\nexpertise and on really useful direct utility.\nIt's simple, it's effective and it provides\ninsight. Now, one of the main associations\nwith business intelligence is what are called\ndashboards, or data dashboards. They look\nlike this; it is a collection of charts and\ntables that go together to give you a very\nquick overview of what is going on in your\nbusiness. And while a lot of data scientists\nmay, let's say, look down their nose upon\ndashboards, I'll say this, most of them are\nvery well designed and you can learn a huge\namount about user interaction and the accessibility\ninformation from dashboards. So really, where\ndoes data science come into this? What is\nthe connection between data science and business\nintelligence? Well, data science can be useful\nto BI in terms of setting it up. Identifying\ndata sources and creating or setting up the\nframework for something like a dashboard or\na business intelligence system. Also, data\nscience can be used to extend it. Data science\ncan be used to get past the easy questions\nand the easy data, to get the questions that\nare actually most useful to you; even if they\nrequire really sometimes data that is hard\nto wrangle and work with. And also, there\nis an interesting interaction here that goes\nthe other way. Data science practitioners\ncan learn a lot about design from good business\nintelligence applications. So, I strongly\nencourage anybody in data science to look\nat them carefully and see what they can learn.\nIn sum: business intelligence, or BI, is very\ngoal oriented. Data science perhaps prepares\nthe data and sets up the form for business\nintelligence, but also data science can learn\na lot about usability and accessibility from\nbusiness intelligence. And so, it is always\nworth taking a close look. Data science has\na lot of real wonderful things about it, but\nit is important to consider some ethical issues,\nand I will specifically call this \"do no harm\"\nin your data science projects. And for that\nwe can say thanks to Hippocrates, the guy\nwho gave us the Hippocratic Oath of Do No\nHarm. Let's specifically talk about some of\nthe important ethical issues, very briefly,\nthat come up in data science. Number one is\nprivacy. That data tells you a lot about people\nand you need to be concerned about the confidentiality.\nIf you have private information about people,\ntheir names, their social security numbers,\ntheir addresses, their credit scores, their\nhealth, that's private, that's confidential,\nand you shouldn't share that information unless\nthey specifically gave you permission. Now,\none of the reasons this presents a special\nchallenge in data science because, we will\nsee later, a lot of the sources that are used\nin data science were not intended for sharing.\nIf you scrape data from a website or from\nPDFs, you need to make sure that it is ok\nto do that. But it was originally created\nwithout the intention of sharing, so privacy\nis something that really falls upon the analyst\nto make sure they are doing it properly. Next,\nis anonymity. One of the interesting things\nwe find is that it is really not hard to identify\npeople in data. If you have a little bit of\nGPS data and you know where a person was at\nfour different points in time, you have about\na 95% chance of knowing exactly who they are.\nYou look at things like HIPAA, that's the\nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability\nAct. Before HIPAA, it was really easy to identify\npeople from medical records. Since then, it\nhas become much more difficult to identify\npeople uniquely. That's an important thing\nfor really people's well-being. And then also,\nproprietary data; if you are working for a\nclient, a company, and they give you their\nown data, that data may have identifiers.\nYou may know who the people are, they are\nnot anonymous anymore. So, anonymity may or\nmay not be there, but major efforts to make\ndata anonymous. But really, the primary thing\nis even if you do know who they are, that\nyou still maintain the privacy and confidentiality\nof the data. Next, there is the issue about\ncopyright, where people try to lock down information.\nNow, just because something is on the web,\ndoesn't mean that you are allowed to use it.\nScraping data from websites is a very common\nand useful way of getting data for projects.\nYou can get data from web pages, from PDFs,\nfrom images, from audio, from really a huge\nnumber of things. But, again the assumption\nthat because it is on the web, it's ok to\nuse it is not true. You always need to check\ncopyright and make sure that it is acceptable\nfor you to access that particular data. Next,\nand our very ominous picture, is data security\nand the idea here is that when you go through\nall the effort to gather data, to clean up\nand prepare for analysis, you have created\nsomething that is very valuable to a lot of\npeople and you have to be concerned about\nhackers trying to come in and steal the data,\nespecially if the data is not anonymous and\nit has identifiers in it. And so, there is\nan additional burden to place on the analyst\nto ensure to the best of their ability that\nthe data is safe and cannot be broken into\nand stolen. And that can include very simple\nthings like a person who is on their project\nbut is no longer, but took the data on a flash\ndrive. You have to find ways to make sure\nthat that can't happen as well. There's a\nlot of possibilities, it's tricky, but it\nis something that you have to consider thoroughly.\nNow, two other things that come up in terms\nof ethics, but usually don't get addressed\nin these conversations. Number one is potential\nbias. The idea here is that the algorithms\nor the formulas that are used in data science\nare only as neutral or bias-free as the rules\nand the data that they get. And so, the idea\nhere is that if you have rules that address\nsomething that is associated with, for instance,\ngender or age or race or economic standing,\nyou might unintentionally be building in those\nfactors. Which, say for instance, say for\ntitle nine, you are not supposed to. You might\nbe building those into the system without\nbeing aware of it, and an algorithm has this\nsheen of objectivity, and people say they\ncan place confidence in it without realizing\nthat it is replicating some of the prejudices\nthat may happen in real life. Another issue\nis overconfidence. And the idea here is that\nanalyses are limited simplifications. They\nhave to be, that is just what they are. And\nbecause of this, you still need humans in\nthe loop to help interpret and apply this.\nThe problem is when people run an algorithm\nto get a number, say to ten decimal places,\nand they say, \"this must be true,\" and treat\nit as written-in-stone absolutely unshakeable\ntruth, when in fact, if the data were biased\ngoing in; if the algorithms were incomplete,\nif the sampling was not representative, you\ncan have enormous problems and go down the\nwrong path with too much confidence in your\nown analyses. So, once again humility is in\norder when doing data science work. In sum:\ndata science has enormous potential, but it\nalso has significant risks involved in the\nprojects. Part of the problem is that analyses\ncan't be neutral, that you have to look at\nhow the algorithms are associated with the\npreferences, prejudices, and biases of the\npeople who made them. And what that means\nis that no matter what, good judgment is always\nvital to quality and success of a data science\nproject. Data Science is a field that is strongly\nassociated with its methods or procedures.\nIn this section of videos, we're going to\nprovide a brief overview of the methods that\nare used in data science. Now, just as a quick\nwarning, in this section things can get kind\nof technical and that can cause some people\nto sort of freak out. But, this course is\na non-technical overview. The technical hands\non stuff is in the other courses. And it is\nreally important to remember that tech is\nsimply the means to doing data science. Insight\nor the ability to find meaning in your data,\nthat's the goal. Tech only helps you get there.\nAnd so, we want to focus primarily on insight\nand the tools and the tech as they serve to\nfurther that goal. Now, there's a few general\ncategories we are going to talk about, again,\nwith an overview for each of these. The first\none is sourcing or data sourcing. That is\nhow to get the data that goes into data science,\nthe raw materials that you need. Second is\ncoding. That again is computer programming\nthat can be used to obtain and manipulate\nand analyze the data. After that, a tiny bit\nof math and that is the mathematics behind\ndata science methods that really form the\nfoundations of the procedures. And then stats,\nthe statistical methods that are frequently\nused to summarize and analyze data, especially\nas applied to data science. And then there\nis machine learning, ML, this is a collection\nof methods for finding clusters in the data,\nfor predicting categories or scores on interesting\noutcomes. And even across these five things,\neven then, the presentations aren't too techie-crunchy,\nthey are basically still friendly. Really,\nthat's the way it is. So, that is the overview\nof the overviews. In sum: we need to remember\nthat data science includes tech, but data\nscience is greater than tech, it is more than\nthose procedures. And above all, that tech\nwhile important to data science is still simply\na means to insight in data. The first step\nin discussing data science methods is to look\nat the methods of sourcing, or getting data\nthat is used in data science. You can think\nof this as getting the raw materials that\ngo into your analyses. Now, you have got a\nfew different choices when it comes to this\nin data science. You can use existing data,\nyou can use something called data APIs, you\ncan scrape web data, or you can make data.\nWe'll talk about each of those very briefly\nin a non-technical manner. For right now,\nlet me say something about existing data.\nThis is data that already is at hand and it\nmight be in-house data. So if you work for\na company, it might be your company records.\nOr, you might have open data; for instance,\nmany governments and many scientific organizations\nmake their data available to the public. And\nthen there is also third party data. This\nis usually data that you buy from a vendor,\nbut it exists and it is very easy to plug\nit in and go. You can also use APIs. Now,\nthat stands for Application Programming Interface,\nand this is something that allows various\ncomputer applications to communicate directly\nwith each other. It's like phones for your\ncomputer programs. It is the most common way\nof getting web data, and the beautiful thing\nabout it is it allows you to import that data\ndirectly into whatever program or application\nyou are using to analyze the data. Next is\nscraping data. And this is where you want\nto use data that is on the web, but they don't\nhave an existing API. And what that means,\nis usually data that's in HTML web tables\nand pages, maybe PDFs. And you can do this\neither with using specialized applications\nfor scraping data or you can do it in a programming\nlanguage, like R or Python, and write the\ncode to do the data scraping. Or another option\nis to make data. And this lets you get exactly\nwhat you need; you can be very specific and\nyou can get what you need. You can do something\nlike interviews, or you can do surveys, or\nyou can do experiments. There is a lot of\napproaches, most of them require some specialized\ntraining in terms of how to gather quality\ndata. And that is actually important to remember,\nbecause no matter what method you use for\ngetting or making new data, you need to remember\nthis one little aphorism you may have heard\nfrom computer science. It goes by the name\nof GIGO: that actually stands for \"Garbage\nIn, Garbage Out,\" and it means if you have\nbad data that you are feeding into your system,\nyou are not going to get anything worthwhile,\nany real insights out of it. Consequently,\nit is important to pay attention to metrics\nor methods for measuring and the meaning - exactly\nwhat it is that they tell you. There's a few\nways you can do this. For instance, you can\ntalk about business metrics, you can talk\nabout KPIs, which means Key Performance Indicators,\nalso used in business settings. Or SMART goals,\nwhich is a way of describing the goals that\nare actionable and timely and so on. You can\nalso talk about, in a measurement sense, classification\naccuracy. And I will discuss each of those\nin a little more detail in a later movie.\nBut for right now, in sum, we can say this:\ndata sourcing is important because you need\nto get the raw materials for your analysis.\nThe nice thing is there's many possible methods,\nmany ways that you can use to get the data\nfor data science. But no matter what you do,\nit is important to check the quality and the\nmeaning of the data so you can get the most\ninsight possible out of your project. The\nnext step we need to talk about in data science\nmethods is coding, and I am going to give\nyou a very brief non-technical overview of\ncoding in data science. The idea here is that\nyou are going to get in there and you are\ngoing to King of the Jungle/master of your\ndomain and make the data jump when you need\nit to jump. Now, if you remember when we talked\nabout the Data Science Venn Diagram at the\nbeginning, coding is up here on the top left.\nAnd while we often think about sort of people\ntyping lines of code (which is very frequent),\nit is more important to remember when we talk\nabout coding (or just computers in general),\nwhat we are really talking about here is any\ntechnology that lets you manipulate the data\nin the ways that you need to perform the procedures\nyou need to get the insight that you want\nout of your data. Now, there are three very\ngeneral categories that we will be discussing\nhere on datalab. The first is apps; these\nare specialized applications or programs for\nworking with data. The second is data; or\nspecifically, data formats. There's special\nformats for web data, I will mention those\nin a moment. And then, code; there are programming\nlanguages that give you full control over\nwhat the computer does and how you interact\nwith the data. Let's take a look at each one\nvery briefly. In terms of apps, there are\nspreadsheets, like Excel or Google Sheets.\nThese are the fundamental data tools of probably\na majority of the world. There are specialized\napplications, like Tableau for data visualization,\nor SPSS, it is a very common statistical package\nin the social sciences and in businesses,\nand one of my favorites, JASP, which is a\nfree open source analog of SPSS, which actually\nI think is a lot easier to use and replicate\nresearch with. And, there are tons of other\nchoices. Now, in terms of web data, it is\nhelpful to be familiar with things like HTML,\nand XML, and JSON, and other formats that\nare used to encapsulate data on the web, because\nthose are the things that you are going to\nhave to be programming about to interact with\nwhen you get your data. And then there are\nactual coding languages. R is probably the\nmost common, along with Python; general purpose\nlanguage, but it has been well adapted for\ndata use. There's SQL, the structured query\nlanguage for databases, and very basic languages\nlike C, C++, and Java, which are used more\nin the back-end of data science. And then\nthere is Bash, the most common command line\ninterface, and regular expressions. And we\nwill talk about all of these in other courses\nhere at datalab. But, remember this: tools\nare just tools. They are only one part of\nthe data science process. They are a means\nto the end, and the end, the goal is insight.\nYou need to know where you are trying to go\nand then simply choose the tools that help\nyou reach that particular goal. That's the\nmost important thing. So, in sum, here's a\nfew things: number one, use your tools wisely.\nRemember your questions need to drive the\nprocess, not the tools themselves. Also, I\nwill just mention that a few tools is usually\nenough. You can do an awful lot with Excel\nand R. And then, the most important thing\nis: focus on your goal and choose your tools\nand even your data to match the goal, so you\ncan get the most useful insights from your\ndata. The next step in our discussion of data\nscience methods is mathematics, and I am going\nto give a very brief overview of the math\ninvolved in data science. Now, the important\nthing to remember is that math really forms\nthe foundation of what we're going to do.\nIf you go back to the Data Science Venn Diagram,\nwe've got stats up here in the right corner,\nbut really it's math and stats, or quantitative\nability in general, but we'll focus on the\nmath part right here. And probably the most\nimportant question is how much math is enough\nto do what you need to do? Or to put it another\nway, why do you need math at all, because\nyou have got a computer to do it? Well, I\ncan think of three reasons you don't want\nto rely on just the computer, but it is helpful\nto have some sound mathematical understanding.\nHere they are: number one, you need to know\nwhich procedures to use and why. So you have\nyour question, you have your data and you\nneed to have enough of an understanding to\nmake an informed choice. That's not terribly\ndifficult. Two, you need to know what to do\nwhen things don't work right. Sometimes you\nget impossible results. I know that statistics\nyou can get a negative adjusted R2; that's\nnot supposed to happen. And it is good to\nknow the mathematics that go into calculating\nthat so you can understand how something apparently\nimpossible can work. Or, you are trying to\ndo a factor analysis or principal component\nand you get a rotation that won't convert.\nIt helps to understand what it is about the\nalgorithm that's happening, and why that won't\nwork in that situation. And number three,\ninterestingly, some procedures, some math\nis easier and quicker to do by hand than by\nfiring up the computer. And I'll show you\na couple of examples in later videos, where\nthat can be the case. Now, fundamentally there\nis a nice sort of analogy here. Math is to\ndata science as, for instance, chemistry is\nto cooking, kinesiology is to dancing, and\ngrammar is to writing. The idea here is that\nyou can be a wonderful cook without knowing\nany chemistry, but if you know some chemistry\nit is going to help. You can be a wonderful\ndancer without know kinesiology, but it is\ngoing to help. And you can probably be a good\nwriter without having an explicit knowledge\nof grammar, but it is going to make a big\ndifference. The same thing is true of data\nscience; you will do it better if you have\nsome of the foundational information. So,\nthe next question is: what kinds of math do\nyou need for data science? Well, there's a\nfew answers to that. Number one is algebra;\nyou need some elementary algebra. That is,\nthe basically simple stuff. You can have to\ndo some linear or matrix algebra because that\nis the foundation of a lot of the calculations.\nAnd you can also have systems of linear equations\nwhere you are trying to solve several equations\nall at once. It is a tricky thing to do, in\ntheory, but this is one of the things that\nis actually easier to do by hand sometimes.\nNow, there's more math. You can get some Calculus.\nYou can get some big O, which has to do with\nthe order of a function, which has to do with\nsort of how fast it works. Probability theory\ncan be important, and Bayes' theorem, which\nis a way of getting what is called a posterior\nprobability can also be a really helpful tool\nfor answering some fundamental questions in\ndata science. So in sum: a little bit of math\ncan help you make informed choices when planning\nyour analyses. Very significantly, it can\nhelp you find the problems and fix them when\nthings aren't going right. It is the ability\nto look under the hood that makes a difference.\nAnd then truthfully, some mathematical procedures,\nlike systems of linear equations, that can\neven be done by hand, sometimes faster than\nyou can do with a computer. So, you can save\nyourself some time and some effort and move\nahead more quickly toward your goal of insight.\nNow, data science wouldn't be data science\nand its methods without a little bit of statistics.\nSo, I am going to give you a brief statistics\noverview here of how things work in data science.\nNow, you can think of statistics as really\nan attempt to find order in chaos, find patterns\nin an overwhelming mess. Sort of like trying\nto see the forest and the trees. Now, let's\ngo back to our little Venn Diagram here. We\nrecently had math and stats here in the top\ncorner. We are going to go back to talking\nabout stats, in particular. What you are trying\nto do here; one thing is to explore your data.\nYou can have exploratory graphics, because\nwe are visual people and it is usually easiest\nto see things. You can have exploratory statistics,\na numerical exploration of the data. And you\ncan have descriptive statistics, which are\nthe things that most people would have talked\nabout when they took a statistics class in\ncollege (if they did that). Next, there is\ninference. I've got smoke here because you\ncan infer things about the wind and the air\nmovement by looking at patterns in smoke.\nThe idea here is that you are trying to take\ninformation from samples and infer something\nabout a population. You are trying to go from\none source to another. One common version\nof this is hypothesis testing. Another common\nversion is estimations, sometimes called Confidence\nIntervals. There are other ways to do it,\nbut all of these let you go beyond the data\nat hand to making larger conclusions. Now,\none interesting thing about statistics is\nyou're going to have to be concerned with\nsome of the details and arranging things just\nso. For instance, you get to do something\nlike feature selection and that's picking\nvariables that should be included or combinations\nand there are problems that can come up that\nare frequent problems and I will address some\nof those in later videos. There's also the\nmatter of validation. When you create a statistical\nmodel you have to see if it is actually accurate.\nHopefully, you have enough data that you can\nhave a holdout sample and do that, or you\ncan replicate the study. Then, there is the\nchoice of estimators that you use; how you\nactually get the coefficients or the combinations\nin your model. And then there's ways of assessing\nhow well your model fits the data. All of\nthese are issues that I'll address briefly\nwhen we talk about statistical analysis at\ngreater length. Now, I do want to mention\none thing in particular here, and I just call\nthis \"beware the trolls.\" There are people\nout there who will tell you that if you don't\ndo things exactly the way they say to do it,\nthat your analysis is meaningless, that your\ndata is junk and you've lost all your time.\nYou know what? They're trolls. So, the idea\nhere is don't listen to that. You can make\nenough of an informed decision on your own\nto go ahead and do an analysis that is still\nuseful. Probably one of the most important\nthings to think about in this is this wonderful\nquote from a very famous statistician and\nit says, \"All models or all statistical models\nare wrong, but some are useful.\" And so the\nquestion isn't whether you're technically\nright, or you have some sort of level of intellectual\npurity, but whether you have something that\nis useful. That, by the way, comes from George\nBox. And I like to think of it basically as\nthis: as wave your flag, wave your \"do it\nyourself\" flag, and just take pride in what\nyou're able to accomplish even when there\nare people who may be criticizing it. Go ahead,\nyou're doing something, go ahead and do it.\nSo, in sum: statistics allow you to explore\nand describe your data. It allows you to infer\nthings about the population. There is a lot\nof choices available, a lot of procedures.\nBut no matter what you do, the goal is useful\ninsight. Keep your eyes on that goal and you\nwill find something meaningful and useful\nin your data to help you in your own research\nand projects. Let's finish our data science\nmethods overview by getting a brief overview\nof Machine Learning. Now, I've got to admit\nwhen you say the term \"machine learning,\"\npeople start thinking something like, \"the\nrobot overlords are going to take over the\nworld.\" That's not what it is. Instead, let's\ngo back to our Venn Diagram one more time,\nand in the intersection at the top between\ncoding and stats is Machine Learning or as\nit's commonly called, just ML. The goal of\nMachine Learning is to go and work in data\nspace so you can, for instance, you can take\na whole lot of data (we've got tons of books\nhere), and then you can reduce the dimensionality.\nThat is, take a very large, scattered, data\nset and try to find the most essential parts\nof that data. Then you can use these methods\nto find clusters within the data; like goes\nwith like. You can use methods like k-means.\nYou can also look for anomalies or unusual\ncases that show up in the data space. Or,\nif we go back to categories again, I talked\nabout like for like. You can use things like\nlogistic regression or k-nearest neighbors,\nKNN. You can use Naive Bayes for classification\nor Decision Trees or SVM, which is Support\nVector Machines, or artificial neural nets.\nAny of those will help you find the patterns\nand the clumping in the data so you can get\nsimilar cases next to each other, and get\nthe cohesion that you need to make conclusions\nabout these groups. Also, a major element\nof machine learning is predictions. You're\ngoing to point your way down the road. The\nmost common approach here; the most basic\nis linear regression, multiple regression.\nThere is also Poisson regression, which is\nused for modeling count or frequency data.\nAnd then there is the issue of Ensemble models,\nwhere you create several models and you take\nthe predictions from each of those and you\nput them together to get an overall more reliable\nprediction. Now, I will talk about each of\nthese in a little more detail in later courses,\nbut for right now I mostly just want you to\nknow that these things exist, and that's what\nwe mean when we refer to Machine Learning.\nSo, in sum: machine learning can be used to\ncategorize cases and to predict scores on\noutcomes. And there's a lot of choices, many\nchoices and procedures available. But, again,\nas I said with statistics, and I'll also say\nagain many times after this, no matter what,\nthe goal is not that \"I'm going to do an artificial\nneural network or a SVM,\" the goal is to get\nuseful insight into your data. Machine learning\nis a tool, and use it to the extent that it\nhelps you get that insight that you need.\nIn the last several videos I've talked about\nthe role in data science of technical things.\nOn the other hand, communicating is essential\nto the practice, and the first thing I want\nto talk about there is interpretability. The\nidea here is that you want to be able to lead\npeople through a path on your data. You want\nto tell a data-driven story, and that's the\nentire goal of what you are doing with data\nscience. Now, another way to think about this\nis: when you are doing your analysis, what\nyou're trying to do is solve for value. You're\nmaking an equation. You take the data, you're\ntrying to solve for value. The trouble is\nthis: a lot of people get hung up on analysis,\nbut they need to remember that analysis is\nnot the same thing as value. Instead, I like\nto think of it this way: that analysis times\nstory is equal to value. Now, please note\nthat's multiplicative, not additive, and so\none consequence of that is when you go back\nto, analysis times story equals value. Well,\nif you have zero story you're going to have\nzero value because, as you recall, anything\ntimes zero is zero. So, instead of that let's\ngo back to this and say what we really want\nto do is, we want to maximize the story so\nthat we can maximize the value that results\nfrom our analysis. Again, maximum value is\nthe overall goal here. The analysis, the tools,\nthe tech, are simply methods for getting to\nthat goal. So, let's talk about goals. For\ninstance, an analysis is goal-driven. You\nare trying to accomplish something that's\nspecific, so the story, or the narrative,\nor the explanation you give about your project\nshould match those goals. If you are working\nfor a client that has a specific question\nthat they want you to answer, then you have\na professional responsibility to answer those\nquestions clearly and unambiguously, so they\nknow whether you said yes or no and they know\nwhy you said yes or no. Now, part of the problem\nhere is the fact the client isn't you and\nthey don't see what you do. And as I show\nhere, simply covering your face doesn't make\nthings disappear. You have to worry about\na few psychological abstractions. You have\nto worry about egocentrism. And I'm not talking\nabout being vain, I'm talking about the idea\nthat you think other people see and know and\nunderstand what you know. That's not true;\notherwise, they wouldn't have hired you in\nthe first place. And so you have to put it\nin terms that the client works with, and that\nthey understand, and you're going to have\nto get out of your own center in order to\ndo that. Also, there's the idea of false consensus;\nthe idea that, \"well everybody knows that.\"\nAnd again, that's not true, otherwise, they\nwouldn't have hired you. You need to understand\nthat they are going to come from a different\nbackground with a different range of experience\nand interpretation. You're going to have to\ncompensate for that. A funny little thing\nis the idea about anchoring. When you give\nsomebody an initial impression, they use that\nas an anchor, and then they adjust away from\nit. So if you are going to try to flip things\nover on their heads, watch out for giving\na false impression at the beginning unless\nyou absolutely need to. But most importantly,\nin order to bridge the gap between the client\nand you, you need to have clarity and explain\nyourself at each step. You can also think\nabout the answers. When you are explaining\nthe project to the client, you might want\nto start in a very simple procedure: state\nthe question that you are answering. Give\nyour answer to that question, and if you need\nto, qualify as needed. And then, go in order\ntop to bottom, so you're trying to make it\nas clear as possible what you're saying, what\nthe answer is, and make it really easy to\nfollow. Now, in terms of discussing your process,\nhow you did this all. Most of the time it\nis probably the case of they don't care, they\njust want to know what the answer is and that\nyou used a good method to get that. So, in\nterms of discussing processes or the technical\ndetails, only when absolutely necessary. That's\nsomething to keep in mind. The process here\nis to remember that analysis, which means\nbreaking something apart. This, by the way,\nis a mechanical typewriter broken into its\nindividual component. Analysis means to take\nsomething apart, and analysis of data is an\nexercise in simplification. You're taking\nthe overall complexity, sort of the overwhelmingness\nof the data, and you're boiling it down and\nfinding the patterns that make sense and serve\nthe needs of your client. Now, let's go to\na wonderful quote from our friend Albert Einstein\nhere, who said, \"Everything should be made\nas simple as possible, but not simpler.\" That's\ntrue in presenting your analysis. Or, if you\nwant to go see the architect and designer\nLudwig Mies van der Rohe, who said, \"Less\nis more.\" It is actually Robert Browning who\noriginally said that, but Mies van der Rohe\npopularized it. Or, if you want another way\nof putting a principle that comes from my\nfield, I'm actually a psychological researcher;\nthey talk about being minimally sufficient.\nJust enough to adequately answer the question.\nIf you're in commerce you know about a minimal\nviable product, it is sort of the same idea\nwithin analysis here, the minimal viable analysis.\nSo, here's a few tips: when you're giving\na presentation, more charts, less text, great.\nAnd then, simplify the charts; remove everything\nthat doesn't need to be in there. Generally,\nyou want to avoid tables of data because those\nare hard to read. And then, one more time\nbecause I want to emphasize it, less text\nagain. Charts, tables can usually carry the\nmessage. And so, let me give you an example\nhere. I'm going to give a very famous dataset\nat Berkeley admissions. Now, these are not\nstairs at Berkeley, but it gives the idea\nof trying to get into something that is far\noff and distant. Here's the data; this is\ngraduate school admissions in 1973, so it's\nover 40 years ago. The idea is that men and\nwomen were both applying for graduate school\nat the University of California Berkeley.\nAnd what we found is that 44 percent of the\nmen who applied were admitted, that's their\npart in green. And of the women, only 35 percent\nof women were admitted when they applied.\nSo, really at first glance this is bias, and\nit actually led to a lawsuit, it was a major\nissue. So, what Berkeley then tried to do\nwas find out, \"well which programs are responsible\nfor this bias?\" And they got a very curious\nset of results. If you break the applications\ndown by program (and here we are calling them\nA through F), six different programs. What\nyou find, actually, is that in each of these\nmale applicants on the left female applicants\nare on the right. If you look at program A,\nwomen actually got accepted at a higher rate,\nand the same is true for B, and the same is\ntrue for D, and the same is true for F. And\nso, this is a very curious set of responses\nand it is something that requires explanation.\nNow in statistics, this is something that\nis known as Simpson's Paradox. But here is\nthe paradox: bias may be negligible at the\ndepartment level. And in fact, as we saw in\nfour of the departments, there was a possible\nbias in favor of women. And the problem is\nthat women applied to more selective programs,\nprograms with lower acceptance rates. Now,\nsome people stop right here and say therefore,\n\"nothing is going on, nothing to complain\nabout.\" But you know, that's still ending\nthe story a little bit early. There are other\nquestions that you can ask, and as producing\na data-driven story, this is stuff that you\nwould want to do. So, for instance, you may\nwant to ask, \"why do the programs vary in\noverall class size? Why do the acceptance\nrates differ from one program to the other?\nWhy do men and women apply to different programs?\"\nAnd you might want to look at things like\nthe admissions criteria for each of the programs,\nthe promotional strategies, how they advertise\nthemselves to students. You might want to\nlook at the kinds of prior education the students\nhave in the programs, and you really want\nto look at funding level for each of the programs.\nAnd so, really, you get one answer, at least\nmore questions, maybe some more answers, and\nmore questions, and you need to address enough\nof this to provide a comprehensive overview\nand solution to your client. In sum, let's\nsay this: stories give value to data analysis.\nAnd when you tell the story, you need to make\nsure that you are addressing your client's'\ngoals in a clear, unambiguous way. The overall\nprinciple here is be minimally sufficient.\nGet to the point, make it clear. Say what\nyou need to, but otherwise be concise and\nmake your message clear. The next step in\ndiscussing data science and communicating\nis to talk about actionable insights, or information\nthat can be used productively to accomplish\nsomething. Now, to give sort of a bizarre\nsegue here, you look at a game controller.\nIt may be a pretty thing, it may be a nice\nobject, but remember: game controllers exist\nto do something. They exist to help you play\nthe game and to do it as effectively as possible.\nThey have a function, they have a purpose.\nSame way data is for doing. Now, that's a\nparaphrase for one of my favorite historical\nfigures. This is William James, the father\nof American Psychology, and pragmatism is\nphilosophy. And he has this wonderful quote,\nhe said, \"My thinking is first and last and\nalways for the sake of my doing.\" And the\nidea applies to analysis. Your analysis and\nyour data is for the sake of your doing. So,\nyou're trying to get some sort of specific\ninsight in how you should proceed. What you\nwant to avoid is the opposite of this from\none of my other favorite cultural heroes,\nthe famous Yankees catcher Yogi Berra, who\nsaid, \"We're lost, but we're making good time.\"\nThe idea here is that frantic activity does\nnot make up for lack of direction. You need\nto understand what you are doing so you can\nreach the particular goal. And your analysis\nis supposed to do that. So, when you're giving\nyour analysis, you're going to try to point\nthe way. Remember, why was the project conducted?\nThe goal is usually to direct some kind of\naction, reach some kind of goal for your client.\nAnd that the analysis should be able to guide\nthat action in an informed way. One thing\nyou want to do is, you want to be able to\ngive the next steps to your client. Give the\nnext steps; tell them what they need to do\nnow. You want to be able to justify each of\nthose recommendations with the data and your\nanalysis. As much as possible be specific,\ntell them exactly what they need to do. Make\nsure it's doable by the client, that it's\nwithin their range of capability. And that\neach step should build on the previous step.\nNow, that being said, there is one really\nfundamental sort of philosophical problem\nhere, and that's the difference between correlation\nand causation. Basically, it goes this way:\nyour data gives you correlation; you know\nthat this is associated with that. But your\nclient doesn't simply want to know what's\nassociated; they want to know what causes\nsomething. Because if they are going to do\nsomething, that's an intervention designed\nto produce a particular result. So, really,\nhow do you get from the correlation, which\nis what you have in the data, to the causation,\nwhich is what your client wants? Well, there's\na few ways to do that. One is experimental\nstudies; these are randomized, controlled\ntrials. Now, that's theoretically the simplest\npath to causality, but it can be really tricky\nin the real world. There are quasi-experiments,\nand these are methods, a whole collection\nof methods. They use non-randomized data,\nusually observational data, adjusted in particular\nways to get an estimate of causal inference.\nOr, there's the theory and experience. And\nthis is research-based theory and domain-specific\nexperience. And this is where you actually\nget to rely on your client's information.\nThey can help you interpret the information,\nespecially if they have greater domain expertise\nthan you do. Another thing to think about\nare the social factors that affect your data.\nNow, you remember the data science Venn Diagram.\nWe've looked at it lots of times. It has got\nthese three elements. Some proposed adding\na fourth circle to this Venn diagram, and\nwe'll kind of put that in there and say that\nsocial understanding is also important, critical\nreally, to valid data science. Now, I love\nthat idea, and I do think that it's important\nto understand how things are going to play\nout. There are a few kinds of social understanding.\nYou want to be aware of your client's mission.\nYou want to make sure that your recommendations\nare consistent with your client's mission.\nAlso, that your recommendations are consistent\nwith your client's identity; not just, \"This\nis what we do,\" but, \"This is really who we\nare.\" You need to be aware of the business\ncontext, sort of the competitive environment\nand the regulatory environment that they're\nworking in. As well as the social context;\nand that can be outside of the organization,\nbut even more often within the organization.\nYour recommendations will affect relationships\nwithin the client's organization. And you\nare going to try to be aware of those as much\nas you can to make it so that your recommendations\ncan be realized the way they need to be. So,\nin sum: data science is goal focused, and\nwhen you're focusing on that goal for your\nclient you need to give specific next steps\nthat are based on your analysis and justifiable\nfrom the data. And in doing so, be aware of\nthe social, political, and economic context\nthat gives you the best opportunity of getting\nsomething really useful out of your analysis.\nWhen you're working in data science and trying\nto communicate your results, presentation\ngraphics can be an enormously helpful tool.\nThink of it this way: you are trying to paint\na picture for the benefit of your client.\nNow, when you're working with graphics there\ncan be a couple of different goals; it depends\non what kind of graphics you're working with.\nThere's the general category of exploratory\ngraphics. These are ones that you are using\nas the analyst. And for exploratory graphics,\nyou need speed and responsiveness, and so\nyou get very simple graphics. This is a base\nhistogram in R. And they can get a little\nmore sophisticated and this is done in ggplot2.\nAnd you can break it down into a couple other\nhistograms, or you can make it a different\nway, or make it see-through, or split them\napart into small multiples. But in each case,\nthis is done for the benefit of you as the\nanalyst understanding the data. These are\nquick, they're effective. Now, they are not\nvery well-labeled, and they are usually for\nyour insight, and then you do other things\nas a result of that. On the other hand, presentation\ngraphics which are for the benefit of your\nclient, those need clarity and they need a\nnarrative flow. Now, let me talk about each\nof those characteristics very briefly. Clarity\nversus distraction. There are things that\ncan go wrong in graphics. Number one is color.\nColors can actually be a problem. Also, three-dimensional\nor false dimensions are nearly always a distraction.\nOne that gets a little touchy for some people\nis interaction. We think of interactive graphics\nas really cool, great things to have, but\nyou run the risk of people getting distracted\nby the interaction and start playing around\nwith it. Going, like, \"Ooh, I press here it\ndoes that.\" And that distracts from the message.\nSo actually, it may be important to not have\ninteraction. And then the same thing is true\nof animation. Flat, static graphics can often\nbe more informative because they have fewer\ndistractions in them. Let me give you a quick\nexample of how not to do things. Now, this\nis a chart that I made. I made it in Excel,\nand I did it based on some of the mistakes\nI've seen in graphics submitted to me when\nI teach. And I guarantee you, everything in\nhere I have seen in real life, just not necessarily\ncombined all at once. Let's zoom in on this\na little bit, so we can see the full badness\nof this graphic. And let's see what's going\non here. We've got a scale here that starts\nat 8 goes to 28% and is tiny; doesn't even\ncover the range of the data. We've got this\nbizarre picture on the wall. We've got no\naccess lines on the walls. We come down here;\nthe labels for educational levels are in alphabetical\norder, instead of the more logical higher\nlevels of education. Then we've got the data\nrepresented as cones, which are difficult\nto read and compare, and it's only made worse\nby the colors and the textures. You know,\nif you want to take an extreme, this one for\ngrad degrees doesn't even make it to the floor\nvalue of 8% and this one for high school grad\nis cut off at the top at 28%. This, by the\nway, is a picture of a sheep, and people do\nthis kind of stuff and it drives me crazy.\nIf you want to see a better chart with the\nexact same data, this is it right here. It\nis a straight bar chart. It's flat, it's simple,\nit's as clean as possible. And this is better\nin many ways. Most effective here is that\nit communicates clearly. There's no distractions,\nit's a logical flow. This is going to get\nthe point across so much faster. And I can\ngive you another example of it; here's a chart\npreviously about salaries for incomes. I have\na list here, I've got data scientist in it.\nIf I want to draw attention to it, I have\nthe option of putting a circle around it and\nI can put a number next to it to explain it.\nThat's one way to make it easy to see what's\ngoing on. We don't even have to get fancy.\nYou know, I just got out a pen and a post-it\nnote and I drew a bar chart of some real data\nabout life expectancy. This tells the story\nas well, that there is something terribly\namiss in Sierra Leone. But, now let's talk\nabout creating narrative flow in your presentation\ngraphics. To do this, I am going to pull some\ncharts from my most cited academic paper,\nwhich is called, A Third Choice: A Review\nof Empirical Research on the Psychological\nOutcomes of Restorative Justice. Think of\nit as mediation for juvenile crimes, mostly\njuvenile. And this paper is interesting because\nreally it's about fourteen bar charts with\njust enough text to hold them together. And\nyou can see there's a flow. The charts are\nvery simple; this is judgments about whether\nthe criminal justice system was fair. The\ntwo bars on the left are victims; the two\nbars on the right are offenders. And for each\ngroup on the left are people who participated\nin restorative justice, so more victim-offender\nmediation for crimes. And for each set on\nthe right are people who went through standard\ncriminal procedures. It says court, but it\nusually means plea bargaining. Anyhow, it's\nreally easy to see that in both cases the\nrestorative justice bar is higher; people\nwere more likely to say it was fair. They\nalso felt that they had an opportunity to\ntell their story; that's one reason why they\nmight think it's fair. They also felt the\noffender was held accountable more often.\nIn fact, if you go to court on the offenders,\nthat one's below fifty percent and that's\nthe offenders themselves making the judgment.\nThen you can go to forgiveness and apologies.\nAnd again, this is actually a simple thing\nto code and you can see there's an enormous\ndifference. In fact, one of the reasons there\nis such a big difference is because instead\nof court preceding, the offender very rarely\nmeets the victim. It also turns out I need\nto qualify this a little bit because a bunch\nof the studies included drunk driving with\nno injuries or accidents. Well, when we take\nthem out, we see a huge change. And then we\ncan go to whether a person is satisfied with\nthe outcome. Again, we see an advantage for\nrestorative justice. Whether the victim is\nstill upset about the crime, now the bars\nare a little bit different. And whether they\nare afraid of revictimization and that is\nover a two to one difference. And then finally\nrecidivism for offenders or reoffending; and\nyou see a big difference there. And so what\nI have here is a bunch of charts that are\nvery very simple to read, and they kind of\nflow in how they're giving the overall impression\nand then detailing it a little bit more. There's\nnothing fancy here, there's nothing interactive,\nthere's nothing animated, there's nothing\nkind of flowing in seventeen different directions.\nIt's easy, but it follows a story and it tells\na narrative about the data and that should\nbe your major goal with the presentation graphics.\nIn sum: presenting, or the graphics you use\nfor presenting, are not the same as the graphics\nyou use for exploring. They have different\nneeds and they have different goals. But no\nmatter what you are doing, be clear in your\ngraphics and be focused in what you're trying\nto tell. And above all create a strong narrative\nthat gives different level of perspective\nand answers questions as you go to anticipate\na client's questions and to give them the\nmost reliable solid information and the greatest\nconfidence in your analysis. The final element\nof data science and communicating that I wanted\nto talk about is reproducible research. And\nyou can think of it as this idea; you want\nto be able to play that song again. And the\nreason for that is data science projects are\nrarely \"one and done;\" rather they tend to\nbe incremental, they tend to be cumulative,\nand they tend to adapt to these circumstances\nthat they're working in. So, one of the important\nthings here, probably, if you want to summarize\nit very briefly, is this: show your work.\nThere's a few reasons for this. You may have\nto revise your research at a later date, your\nown analyses. You may be doing another project\nand you want to borrow something from previous\nstudies. More likely you'll have to hand it\noff to somebody else at a future point and\nthey're going to have to be able to understand\nwhat you did. And then there's the very significant\nissue in both scientific and economic research\nof accountability. You have to be able to\nshow that you did things in a responsible\nway and that your conclusions are justified;\nthat's for clients funding agencies, regulators,\nacademic reviewers, any number of people.\nNow, you may be familiar with the concept\nof open data, but you may be less familiar\nwith the concept of open data science; that's\nmore than open data. So, for instance, I'll\njust let you know there is something called\nthe Open Data Science Conference and ODSC.com.\nAnd it meets three times a year in different\nplaces. And this is entirely, of course, devoted\nto open data science using both open data,\nbut making the methods transparent to people\naround them. One thing that can make this\nreally simple is something called the Open\nScience Framework, which is at OSF.io. It's\na way of sharing your data and your research\nwith an annotation on how you got through\nthe whole thing with other people. It makes\nthe research transparent, which is what we\nneed. One of my professional organizations,\nthe Association for Psychological Science\nhas a major initiative on this called open\npractices, where they are strongly encouraging\npeople to share their data as much as is ethically\npermissible and to absolutely share their\nmethods before they even conduct a study as\na way of getting rigorous intellectual honesty\nand accountability. Now, another step in all\nof this is to archive your data, make that\ninformation available, put it on the shelf.\nAnd what you want to do here is, you want\nto archive all of your datasets; both the\ntotally raw before you did anything with it\ndataset, and every step in the process until\nyour final clean dataset. Along with that,\nyou want to archive all of the code that you\nused in the process and analyzed the data.\nIf you used a programming language like R\nor Python, that's really simple. If you used\na program like SPSS you need to save the syntax\nfiles, and then that can be done that way.\nAnd again, no matter what, make sure to comment\nliberally and explain yourself. Now, part\nof that is you have to explain the process,\nbecause you are not just this lone person\nsitting on the sofa working by yourself, you're\nwith other people and you need to explain\nwhy you did it the way that you did. You need\nto explain the choices, the consequences of\nthose choices, the times that you had to backtrack\nand try it over again. This also works into\nthe principle of future-proofing your work.\nYou want to do a few things here. Number one;\nthe data. You want to store the data in non-proprietary\nformats like a CSV or Comma Separated Values\nfile because anything can read CSV files.\nIf you stored it in the proprietary SPSS.sav\nformat, you might be in a lot of trouble when\nsomebody tries to use it later and they can't\nopen it. Also, there's storage; you want to\nplace all of your files in a secure, accessible\nlocation like GitHub is probably one of the\nbest choices. And then the code, you may want\nto use something like a dependency management\npackage like Packrat for R or Virtual Environment\nfor Python as a way of making sure that the\npackages that you use; that there are always\nversions that work because sometimes things\nget updated and it gets broken. This is a\nway of making sure that the system that you\nhave will always work. Overall, you can think\nof this too: you want to explain yourself\nand a neat way to do that is to put your narrative\nin a notebook. Now, you can have a physical\nlab book or you can also do digital books.\nA really common one, especially if you're\nusing Python, is Jupyter with a \"y\" there\nin the middle. Jupyter notebooks are interactive\nnotebooks. So, here's a screenshot of one\nthat I made in Python, and you have titles,\nyou have text, you have the graphics. If you\nare working in R, you can do this through\nsomething called RMarkdown. Which works in\nthe same way you do it in RStudio, you use\nMarkdown and you can annotate it. You can\nget more information about that at rmarkdown.rstudio.com.\nAnd so for instance, here's an R analysis\nI did, and as you can see the code on the\nleft and you see the markdown version on the\nright. What's neat about this is that this\nlittle bit of code here, this title and this\ntext and this little bit of R code, then is\ndisplayed as this formatted heading, as this\nformatted text, and this turns into the entire\nR output right there. It's a great way to\ndo things. And if you do RMarkdown, you actually\nhave the option of uploading the document\ninto something called RPubs; and that's an\nonline document that can be made accessible\nto anybody. Here's a sample document. And\nif you want to go see it, you can go to this\naddress. It's kind of long, so I am going\nto let you write that one down yourself. But,\nin sum: here's what we have. You want to do\nyour work and archive the information in a\nway that supports collaboration. Explain your\nchoices, say what you did, show how you did\nit. This allows you to future-proof your work,\nso it will work in other situations for other\npeople. And as much as possible, no matter\nhow you do it, make sure you share your narrative\nso people understand your process and they\ncan see that your conclusions are justifiable,\nstrong and reliable. Now, something I've mentioned\nseveral times when talking about data science,\nand I'll do it again in this conclusion, is\nthat it's important to give people next steps.\nAnd I'm going to do that for you right now.\nIf you're wondering what to do after having\nwatched this very general overview course,\nI can give you a few ideas. Number one, maybe\nyou want to start trying to do some coding\nin R or Python; we have courses for those.\nYou might want to try doing some data visualization,\none of the most important things that you\ncan do. You may want to brush up on statistics\nand maybe some math that goes along with it.\nAnd you may want to try your hand at machine\nlearning. All of these will get you up and\nrolling in the practice of data science. You\ncan also try looking at data sourcing, finding\ninformation that you are going to do. But,\nno matter what happens try to keep it in context.\nSo, for instance, data science can be applied\nto marketing, and sports, and health, and\neducation, and the arts, and really a huge\nnumber of other things. And we will have courses\nhere at datalab.cc that talk about all of\nthose. You may also want to start getting\ninvolved in the community of data science.\nOne of the best conferences that you can go\nto is O'Reilly Strata, which meets several\ntimes a year around the globe. There's also\nPredictive Analytics World, again several\ntimes a year around the world. Then there's\nmuch smaller conferences, I love Tapestry\nor tapestryconference.com, which is about\nstorytelling in data science. And Extract,\na one-day conference about data stories that\nis put on by import.io, one of the great data\nsourcing applications that's available for\nscraping web data. If you want to start working\nwith actual data, a great choice is to go\nto Kaggle.com and they sponsor data science\ncompetitions, which actually have cash rewards.\nThere's also wonderful data sets you can work\nwith there to find out how they work and compare\nyour results to those of other people. And\nonce you are feeling comfortable with that,\nyou may actually try turning around and doing\nsome service; datakind.org is the premier\norganization for data science as humanitarian\nservice. They do major projects around the\nworld. I love their examples. There are other\nthings you can do; there's an annual event\ncalled Do Good Data, and then datalab.cc will\nbe sponsoring twice-a-year data charrettes,\nwhich are opportunities for people in the\nUtah area to work with the local nonprofits\non their data. But above all of this, I want\nyou to remember this one thing: data science\nis fundamentally democratic. It's something\nthat everybody needs to learn to do in some\nway, shape or form. The ability to work with\ndata is a fundamental ability and everybody\nwould be better off by learning to work with\ndata intelligently and sensitively. Or, to\nput it another way: data science needs you.\nThanks so much for joining me in this introductory\ncourse and I hope it has been good and I look\nforward to seeing you in the other courses\nhere at datalab.cc. Welcome to \"Data Sourcing\".\nI'm Barton Poulson and in this course, we're\ngoing to talk about Data Opus or that's Latin\nfor Data Needed. The idea here is that no\ndata, no data science; and that is a sad thing.\nSo, instead of leaving it at that we're going\nto use this course to talk about methods for\nmeasuring and evaluating data and methods\nfor accessing existing data and even methods\nfor creating new, custom data. Take those\ntogether and it's a happy situation. At the\nsame time, we'll do all of this still at an\naccessible, conceptual and non-technical level\nbecause the technical hands-on stuff will\nhappen in later other courses. But for now,\nlet's talk data. For data sourcing, the first\nthing we want to talk about is measurement.\nAnd within that category, we're going to talk\nabout metrics. The idea here is that you actually\nneed to know what your target is if you want\nto have a chance to hit it. There's a few\nparticular reasons for this. First off, data\nscience is action-oriented; the goal is to\ndo something as opposed to simply understand\nsomething, which is something I say as an\nacademic practitioner. Also, your goal needs\nto be explicit and that's important because\nthe goals can guide your effort. So, you want\nto say exactly what you are trying to accomplish,\nso you know when you get there. Also, goals\nexist for the benefit of the client, and they\ncan prevent frustration; they know what you're\nworking on, they know what you have to do\nto get there. And finally, the goals and the\nmetrics exist for the benefit of the analyst\nbecause they help you use your time well.\nYou know when you're done, you know when you\ncan move ahead with something, and that makes\neverything a little more efficient and a little\nmore productive. And when we talk about this\nthe first thing you want to do is try to define\nsuccess in your particular project or domain.\nDepending on where you are, in commerce that\ncan include things like sales, or click-through\nrates, or new customers. In education it can\ninclude scores on tests; it can include graduation\nrates or retention. In government, it can\ninclude things like housing and jobs. In research,\nit can include the ability to serve the people\nthat you're to better understand. So, whatever\ndomain you're in there will be different standards\nfor success and you're going to need to know\nwhat applies in your domain. Next, are specific\nmetrics or ways of measuring. Now again, there\nare a few different categories here. There\nare business metrics, there are key performance\nindicators or KPIs, there are SMART goals\n(that's an acronym), and there's also the\nissue of having multiple goals. I'll talk\nabout each of those for just a second now.\nFirst off, let's talk about business metrics.\nIf you're in the commercial world there are\nsome common ways of measuring success. A very\nobvious one is sales revenue; are you making\nmore money, are you moving the merchandise,\nare you getting sales. Also, there's the issue\nof leads generated, new customers, or new\npotential customers because that, then, in\nturn, is associated with future sales. There's\nalso the issue of customer value or lifetime\ncustomer value, so you may have a small number\nof customers, but they all have a lot of revenue\nand you can use that to really predict the\noverall profitability of your current system.\nAnd then there's churn rate, which has to\ndo with, you know, losing and gaining new\ncustomers and having a lot of turnover. So,\nany of these are potential ways for defining\nsuccess and measuring it. These are potential\nmetrics, there are others, but these are some\nreally common ones. Now, I mentioned earlier\nsomething called a key performance indicator\nor KPI. KPIs come from David Parmenter and\nhe's got a few ways of describing them, he\nsays a key performance indicator for business.\nNumber one should be nonfinancial, not just\nthe bottom line, but something else that might\nbe associated with it or that measures the\noverall productivity of the association. They\nshould be timely, for instance, weekly, daily,\nor even constantly gathered information. They\nshould have a CEO focus, so the senior management\nteams are the ones who generally make the\ndecisions that affect how the organization\nacts on the KPIs. They should be simple, so\neverybody in the organization, everybody knows\nwhat they are and knows what to do about them.\nThey should be team-based, so teams can take\njoint responsibility for meeting each one\nof the KPIs. They should have significant\nimpact, what that really means is that they\nshould affect more than one important outcome,\nso you can do profitably and market reach\nor improved manufacturing time and fewer defects.\nAnd finally, an ideal KPI has a limited dark\nside, that means there's fewer possibilities\nfor reinforcing the wrong behaviors and rewarding\npeople for sort of exploiting the system.\nNext, there are SMART goals, where SMART stands\nfor Specific, Measurable, Assignable to a\nparticular person, Realistic (meaning you\ncan actually do it with the resources you\nhave at hand), and Time-bound, (so you know\nwhen it can get done). So, whenever you form\na goal you should try to assess it on each\nof these criteria and that's a way of saying\nthat this is a good goal to be used as a metric\nfor the success of our organization. Now,\nthe trick, however, is when you have multiple\ngoals, multiple possible endpoints. And the\nreason that's difficult is because, well,\nit's easy to focus on one goal if you're just\ntrying to maximize revenue or if you're just\ntrying to maximize graduation rate. There's\na lot of things you can do. It becomes more\ndifficult when you have to focus on many things\nsimultaneously, especially because some of\nthese goals may conflict. The things that\nyou do to maximize one may impair the other.\nAnd so when that happens, you actually need\nto start engaging in a deliberate process\nof optimization, you need to optimize. And\nthere are ways that you can do this if you\nhave enough data; you can do mathematical\noptimization to find the ideal balance of\nefforts to pursue one goal and the other goal\nat the same time. Now, this is a very general\nsummary and let me finish with this. In sum,\nmetrics or methods for measuring can help\nawareness of how well your organization is\nfunctioning and how well you're reaching your\ngoals. There are many different methods available\nfor defining success and measuring progress\ntowards those things. The trick, however,\ncomes when you have to balance efforts to\nreach multiple goals simultaneously, which\ncan bring in the need for things like optimization.\nWhen talking about data sourcing and measurement,\none very important issue has to do with the\naccuracy of your measurements. The idea here\nis that you don't want to have to throw away\nall your ideas; you don't want to waste effort.\nOne way of doing this in a very quantitative\nfashion is to make a classification table.\nSo, what that looks like is this, you talk\nabout, for instance, positive results, negative\nresults... and in fact let's start by looking\nat the top here. The middle two columns here\ntalk about whether an event is present, whether\nyour house is on fire, or whether a sale occurs,\nor whether you have got a tax evader, whatever.\nSo, that's whether a particular thing is actually\nhappening or not. On the left here, is whether\nthe test or the indicator suggests that the\nthing is or is not happening. And then you\nhave these combinations of true positives;\nwhere the test says it's happening and it\nreally is, and false positives; where the\ntest says it happening, but it is not, and\nthen below that true negatives, where the\ntest says it isn't happening and that's correct\nand then false negatives, where the test says\nthere's nothing going on, but there is in\nfact the event occurring. And then you start\nto get the column totals, the total number\nof events present or absent, then the row\ntotals about the test results. Now, from this\ntable what you get is four kinds of accuracy,\nor really four different ways of quantifying\naccuracy using different standards. And they\ngo by these names: sensitivity, specificity,\npositive predictive value, and negative predictive\nvalue. I'll show you very briefly how each\nof them works. Sensitivity can be expressed\nthis way, if there's a fire does the alarm\nring? You want that to happen. And so, that's\na matter of looking at the true positives\nand dividing that by the total number of alarms.\nSo, the test positive means there's an alarm\nand the event present means there's a fire;\nyou want it to always have an alarm when there's\na fire. Specificity, on the other hand, is\nsort of the flip side of this. If there isn't\na fire, does the alarm stay quiet? This is\nwhere you're looking at the ratio of true\nnegatives to total absent events, where there's\nno fire, and the alarms aren't ringing, and\nthat's what you want. Now, those are looking\nat columns; you can also go sideways across\nrows. So, the first one there is positive\npredictive value, often abbreviated as PPV,\nand we flip around the order a little bit.\nThis one says, if the alarm rings, was there\na fire? So, now you're looking at the true\npositives and dividing it by the total number\nof positives. Total number of positives is\nany time the alarm rings. True positives are\nbecause there was a fire. And negative predictive\nvalue, or NPV, says of the alarm doesn't ring,\ndoes that in fact mean that there is no fire?\nWell, here you are looking at true negatives\nand dividing it by total negatives, the time\nthat it doesn't ring. And again, you want\nto maximize that so the true negatives account\nfor all of the negatives, the same way you\nwant the true positives to account for all\nof the positives and so on. Now, you can put\nnumbers on all of these going from zero percent\nto a 100% and the idea is to maximize each\none as much as you can. So, in sum, from these\ntables we get four kinds of accuracy and there's\na different focus for each one. But, the same\noverall goal, you want to identify the true\npositives and true negatives and avoid the\nfalse positives and the false negatives. And\nthis is one of way of putting numbers on,\nan index really, on the accuracy of your measurement.\nNow data sourcing may seem like a very quantitative\ntopic, especially when we're talking about\nmeasurement. But, I want measure one important\nthing here, and that is the social context\nof measurement. The idea here really, is that\npeople are people, and they all have their\nown goals, and they're going their own ways.\nAnd we all have our own thoughts and feelings\nthat don't always coincide with each other,\nand this can affect measurement. And so, for\ninstance, when you're trying to define your\ngoals and you're trying to maximize them you\nwant to look at things like, for instance,\nthe business model. An organization's business\nmodel, the way they conduct their business,\nthe way they make their money, is tied to\nits identity and its reason to be. And if\nyou make a recommendation and it'scontrary\nto their business model, that can actually\nbe perceived as a threat to their core identity,\nand people tend to get freaked out in that\nsituation. Also, restrictions, so for instance,\nthere may be laws, policies, and common practices,\nboth organizationally and culturally, that\nmay limit the ways the goals can be met. Now,\nmost of these make a lot of sense, so the\nidea is you can'tjust do anything you want,\nyou need to have these constraints. And when\nyou make your recommendations, maybe you'll\nwork creatively in them as long as you're\nstill behaving legally and ethically, but\nyou do need to be aware of these constraints.\nNext, is the environment. And the idea here\nis that competition occurs both between organizations,\nthat company here is trying to reach a goal,\nbut they're competing with company B over\nthere, but probably even more significantly\nthere is competition within the organization.\nThis is really a recognition of office politics.\nAnd when you, as a consultant, make a recommendation\nbased on your analysis, you need to understand\nyou're kind of dropping a little football\ninto the office and things are going to further\none person's career, maybe to the detriment\nof another. And in order for your recommendations\nto have maximum effectiveness they need to\nplay out well in the office. That's something\nthat you need to be aware of as you're making\nyour recommendations. Finally, there's the\nissue of manipulation. And a sad truism about\npeople is that any reward system, any reward\nsystem at all, will be exploited and people\nwill generally game the system. This happens\nespecially when you have a strong cut off;\nyou need to get at least 80 percent, or you\nget fired and people will do anything to make\ntheir numbers appear to be eighty percent.\nThis happens an awful lot when you look at\nexecutive compensation systems, it looks a\nlot when you have very high stake school testing,\nit happens in an enormous number of situations,\nand so, you need to be aware of the risk of\nexploitation and gaming. Now, don't think,\nthen, that all is lost. Don't give up, you\ncan still do really wonderful assessment,\nyou can get good metrics, just be aware of\nthese particular issues and be sensitive to\nthem as you both conduct your research and\nas you make your recommendations. So, in sum,\nsocial factors affect goals and they affect\nthe way you meet those goals. There are limits\nand consequences, both on how you reach the\ngoals and how, really, what the goal should\nbe and that when you're making advice on how\nto reach those goals please be sensitive to\nhow things play out with metrics and how people\nwill adapt their behavior to meet the goals.\nThat way you can make something that's more\nlikely to be implemented the way you meant\nand more likely to predict accurately what\ncan happen with your goals. When it comes\nto data sourcing, obviously the most important\nthing is to get data. But the easiest way\nto do that, at least in theory, is to use\nexisting data. Think of it as going to the\nbookshelf and getting the data that you have\nright there at hand. Now, there's a few different\nways to do this: you can get in-house data,\nyou can get open data, and you can get third-party\ndata. Another nice way to think of that is\nproprietary, public, and purchased data; the\nthree Ps I've heard it called. Let's talk\nabout each of these a little bit more. So,\nin-house data, that's stuff that's already\nin your organization. What's nice about that,\nit can be really fast and easy, it's right\nthere and the format may be appropriate for\nthe kind of software in the computer that\nyou are using. If you're fortunate, there's\ngood documentation, although sometimes when\nit's in-house people just kind of throw it\ntogether, so you have to watch out for that.\nAnd there's the issue of quality control.\nNow, this is true with any kind of data, but\nyou need to pay attention with in-house, because\nyou don't know the circumstances necessarily\nunder which people gathered the data and how\nmuch attention they were paying to something.\nThere's also an issue of restrictions; there\nmay be some data that, while it is in-house,\nyou may not be allowed to use, or you may\nnot be able to publish the results or share\nthe results with other people. So, these are\nthings that you need to think about when you're\ngoing to use in-house data, in terms of how\ncan you use it to facilitate your data science\nprojects. Specifically, there are a few pros\nand cons. In-house data is potentially quick,\neasy, and free. Hopefully it's standardized;\nmaybe even the original team that conducted\nthis study is still there. And you might have\nidentifiers in the data which make it easier\nfor you to do an individual level analysis.\nOn the con side however, the in-house data\nsimply may not exist, maybe it's just not\nthere. Or the documentation may be inadequate\nand of course, the quality may be uncertain.\nAlways true, but may be something you have\nto pay more attention to when you're using\nin-house data. Now, another choice is open\ndata like going to the library and getting\nsomething. This is prepared data that's freely\navailable, consists of things like government\ndata and corporate data and scientific data\nfrom a number of sources. Let me show you\nsome of my favorite open data sources just\nso you know where they are and that they exist.\nProbably, the best one is data.gov here in\nthe US. That is the, as it says right here,\nthe home of the US government's open data.\nOr, you may have a state level one. For instance,\nI'm in Utah and we have data.utah.gov, also\na great source of more regional information.\nIf you're in Europe, you have open-data.europa.eu,\nthe European Union open data portal. And then\nthere are major non-profit organizations,\nso the UN has unicef.org/statistics for their\nstatistical and monitoring data. The World\nHealth Organization has the global health\nobservatory at who.int/gho. And then there\nare private organizations that work in the\npublic interest, such as the Pew Research\nCenter, which shares a lot of its data sets\nand the New York Times, which makes it possible\nto use APIs to access a huge amount of the\ndata of things they've published over a huge\ntime span. And then two of the mother loads,\nthere's Google, which at google.com has public\ndata which is a wonderful thing. And then\nAmazon at aws.amazon.com/datasets has gargantuan\ndatasets. So, if you needed a data set that\nwas like five terabytes in size, this is the\nplace that you would go to get it. Now, there's\nsome pros and cons to using this kind of open\ndata. First, is that you can get very valuable\ndatasets that maybe cost millions of dollars\nto gather and to process. And you can get\na very wide range of topics and times and\ngroups of people and so on. And often, the\ndata is very well formatted and well documented.\nThere are, however, a few cons. Sometimes\nthere's biased samples. Say, for instance,\nyou only get people who have internet access,\nand that can mean, not everybody. Sometimes\nthe meaning of the data is not clear or it\nmay not mean exactly what you want it to.\nA potential problem is that sometimes you\nmay need to share your analyses and if you\nare doing proprietary research, well, it's\ngoing to have to be open instead, so that\ncan create a crimp with some of your clients.\nAnd then finally there are issues with privacy\nand confidentiality and in public data that\nusually means that the identifiers are not\nthere and you are going to have to work at\na larger aggregate level of measurement. Another\noption is to use data from a third-party,\nthese go by the name Data as a Service or\nDaaS. You can also call them data brokers.\nAnd the thing about data brokers is they can\ngive you an enormous amount of data on many\ndifferent topics, plus they can save you some\ntime and effort, by actually doing some of\nthe processing for you. And that can include\nthings like consumer behaviors and preferences,\nthey can get contact information, they can\ndo marketing identity and finances, there's\na lot of things. There's a number of data\nbrokers around, here's a few of them. Acxiom\nis probably the biggest one in terms of marketing\ndata. There's also Nielsen which provides\ndata primarily for media consumption. And\nthere's another organization Datasift, that's\na smaller newer one. And there's a pretty\nwide range of choices, but these are some\nof the big ones. Now, the thing about using\ndata brokers, there's some pros and there's\nsome cons. The pros are first, that it can\nsave you a lot of time and effort. It can\nalso give you individual level data which\ncan be hard to get from open data. Open data\nis usually at the community level; they can\ngive you information about specific consumers.\nThey can even give you summaries and inferences\nabout things like credit scores and marital\nstatus. Possibly even whether a person gambles\nor smokes. Now, the con is this, number 1\nit can be really expensive, I mean this is\na huge service; it provides a lot of benefit\nand is priced accordingly. Also, you still\nneed to validate it, you still need to double\ncheck that it means what you think it means\nand that it works in with what you want. And\nprobably the real sticking point here is the\nuse of third-party data is distasteful to\nmany people, and so you have to be aware that\nas you're making your choices. So, in sum,\nas far as data sourcing existing data goes\nobviously data science needs data and there's\nthe three Ps of data sources, Proprietary\nand Public and Purchased. But no matter what\nsource you use, you need to pay attention\nto quality and to the meaning and the usability\nof the data to help you along in your own\nprojects. When it comes to data sourcing,\na really good way of getting data is to use\nwhat are called APIs. Now, I like to think\nof these as the digital version of Prufrock's\nmermaids. If you're familiar with the love\nsong on J. Alfred Prufrock by TS Eliot, he\nsays, \"I have heard the mermaids singing,\neach to each,\" that's TS Eliot. And I like\nto adapt that to say, \"APIs have heard apps\nsinging, each to each,\" and that's by me.\nNow, more specifically when we talk about\nan API, what we're talking about is something\ncalled Application Programming Interface,\nand this is something that allows programs\nto talk to each other. Its most important\nuse, in terms of data science, is it allows\nyou to get web data. It allows your program\nto directly go to the web, on its own, grab\nthe data, bring it back in almost as though\nit were local data, and that's a really wonderful\nthing. Now, the most common version of APIs\nfor data science are called REST APIs; that\nstands for Representational State Transfer.\nThat's the software architectural style of\nthe world wide web and it allows you to access\ndata on web pages via HTTP, that's the hypertext\ntransfer protocol. They, you know, run the\nweb as we know it. And when you download the\ndata that you usually get its in JSON format,\nthat stands for Javascript Object Notation.\nThe nice thing about that is that's human\nreadable, but it's even better for machines.\nThen you can take that information and you\ncan send it directly to other programs. And\nthe nice thing about REST APIs is that they're\nwhat is called language agnostic, meaning\nany programming language can call a REST API,\ncan get data from the web, and can do whatever\nit needs to with it. Now, there are a few\nkinds of APIs that are really common. The\nfirst is what are called Social APIs; these\nare ways of interfacing with social networks.\nSo, for instance, the most common one is Facebook;\nthere's also Twitter. Google Talk has been\na big one and FourSquare as well and then\nSoundCloud. These are on lists of the most\npopular ones. And then there are also what\nare called Visual APIs, which are for getting\nvisual data, so for instance, Google Maps\nis the most common, but YouTube is something\nthat accesses YouTube on a particular website\nor AccuWeather which is for getting weather\ninformation. Pinterest for photos, and Flickr\nfor photos as well. So, these are some really\ncommon APIs and you can program your computer\nto pull in data from any of these services\nand sites and integrate it into your own website\nor here into your own data analysis. Now,\nthere's a few different ways you can do this.\nYou can program it in R, the statistical programming\nlanguage, you can do it in Python, also you\ncan even use it in the very basic BASH command\nline interface, and there's a ton of other\napplications. Basically, anything can access\nan API one way or another. Now, I'd like to\nshow you how this works in R. So, I'm going\nto open up a script in RStudio and then I'm\ngoing to use it to get some very basic information\nfrom a webpage. Let me go to RStudio and show\nyou how this works. Let me open up a script\nin RStudio that allows me to do some data\nsourcing here. Now, I'm just going to use\na package called JSON Lite, I'm going to load\nthat one up, and then I'm going to go to a\ncouple of websites. I'm going to getting historical\ndata from Formula One car races and I'm going\nto be getting it from Ergast.com. Now, if\nwe go to this page right here, I can go straight\nto my browser right now. And this is what\nit looks like; it gives you the API documentation,\nso what you're doing for an API, is you're\njust entering a web address and in that web\naddress it includes the information you want.\nI'll go back to R here just for a second.\nAnd if I want to get information about 1957\nraces in JSON format, I go to this address.\nI can skip over to that for a second, and\nwhat you see is it's kind of a big long mess\nhere, but it is all labeled and it is clear\nto the computer what's going on here. Let's\ngo back to R. And so what I'm going to do\nis, I am going to save that URL into an object\nhere, in R, and then I'm going to use the\ncommand from JSON to read that URL and save\nit into R. And which it has now done. And\nI'm going to zoom in on that so you can see\nwhat's happened. I've got this sort of mess\nof text, this is actually a list object in\nR. And then I'm going to get just the structure\nof that object, so I'm going to do this one\nright here and you can see that it's a list\nand it gives you the names of all the variables\nwithin each one of the lists. And what I'm\ngoing to do is, I'm going to convert that\nlist to a data frame. I went through the list\nand found where the information I wanted was\nlocated, you have to use this big long statement\nhere, that will give me the names of the drivers.\nLet me zoom in on that again. There they are.\nAnd then I'm going to get just the column\nnames for that bit of the data frame. So,\nwhat I have here is six different variables.\nAnd then what I'm going to do is, I'm going\nto pick just the first five cases and I'm\ngoing to select some variables and put them\nin a different order. And when I do that,\nthis is what I get. I will zoom in on that\nagain. And the first five people listed in\nthis data set that I pulled from 1957, are\nJuan Fangio, makes sense one of the greatest\ndrivers ever, and other people who competed\nin that year. And so what I've done is by\nusing this API call in R, a very simple thing\nto do, I was able to pull data off that webpage\nin a structured format, and do a very simple\nanalysis with it. And let's sum up what we've\nlearned from all this. First off, APIs make\nit really easy to work with web data, they\nstructure, they call it for you, and then\nthey feed it straight into the program for\nyou to analyze. And they are one of the best\nways of getting data and getting started in\ndata science. When you're looking for data,\nanother great way of getting data is through\nscraping. And what that means is pulling information\nfrom webpages. I like to think of it as when\ndata is hiding in the open; it's there, you\ncan see it, but there's not an easy, immediate\nway to get that data. Now, when you're dealing\nwith scraping, you can get data in several\ndifferent formats. You can get HTML text from\nwebpages, you can get HTML tables from the\nrows and columns that appear on webpages.\nYou can scrape data from PDFs, and you can\nscrape data from all sorts of data from images\nand video and audio. Now, we will make one\nvery important qualification before we say\nanything else: pay attention to copyright\nand privacy. Just because something is on\nthe web, doesn't mean you're allowed to pull\nit out. Information gets copyrighted, and\nso when I use examples here, I make sure that\nthis is stuff that's publicly available, and\nyou should do the same when you are doing\nyour own analyses. Now, if you want to scrape\ndata there's a couple of ways to do it. Number\none, is to use apps that are developed for\nthis. So, for instance, import.io is one of\nmy favorites. It is both a webpage, that's\nits address, and it's a downloadable app.\nThere's also ScraperWiki. There's an application\ncalled Tabula, and you can even do scraping\nin Google Sheets, which I will demonstrate\nin a second, and Excel. Or, if you don't want\nto use an app or if you want to do something\nthat apps don't really let you do, you can\ncode your scraper. You can do it directly\nin R, or Python, or Bash, or even Java or\nPHP. Now, what you're going to do is you're\ngoing to be looking for information on the\nwebpage. If you're looking for HTML text,\nwhat you're going to do is pull structured\ntext from webpages, similar to how a reader\nview works in a browser. It uses HTML tags\non the webpage to identify what's the important\ninformation. So, there's things like body,\nand h1 for header one, and p for paragraph,\nand the angle brackets. You can also get information\nfrom HTML tables, although this is a physical\ntable of rows and columns I am showing you.\nThis also uses HTML table tags, that is like\ntable, and tr for table row, and td for table\ndata, that's the cell. The trick is when you're\ndoing this, you need the table number and\nsometimes you just have to find that through\ntrial and error. Let me give you an example\nof how this works. Let's take a look at this\nWikipedia page on the Iron Chef America Competition.\nI'm going to go to the web right now and show\nyou that one. So, here we are in Wikipedia,\nIron Chef America. And if you scroll down\na little bit, you see we have got a whole\nbunch of text here, we have got our table\nof contents, and then we come down here, we\nhave a table that lists the winners, the statistics\nfor the winners. And let's say we want to\npull that from this webpage into another program\nfor us to analyze. Well, there is an extremely\neasy way to do this with Google Sheets. All\nwe need to do is open up the Google Sheet\nand in cell A1 of that Google Sheet, we paste\nin this formula. It's IMPORTHTML, then you\ngive the webpage and then you say that you\nare importing a table, you have to put that\nstuff in quotes, and the index number for\nthe table. I had to poke around a little bit\nto figure out this was table number 2. So,\nlet me go to Google Sheets and show you how\nthis works. Here I have a Google Sheet and\nright now it's got nothing in it. But watch\nthis; if I come here to this cell, and I simply\npaste in that information, all the stuff just\nsort of magically propagates into the sheet,\nmakes it extremely easy to deal with, and\nnow I can, for instance, save this as a CSV\nfile, put it in another program. Lots of options.\nAnd so this is one way that I'm scraping the\ndata from a webpage because I didn't use an\nAPI, but I just used a very simple, one-link\ncommand to get the information. Now, that\nwas a HTML table. You can also scrape data\nfrom PDFs. You have to be aware of if it's\na native PDF, I call that a text PDF, or a\nscanned or imaged PDF. And what it does with\nnative PDFs, it looks for text elements; again\nthose are like code that indicates this is\ntext. And you can deal with Raster images,\nthat's pixel images, or vector, which draws\nthe lines, and that's what makes them infinitely\nscalable in many situations. And then in PDFs,\nyou can deal with tabular data, but you probably\nhave to use a specialized program like Scraper,\nWiki, or Tabula in order to get that. And\nthen finally media, like images and video\nand audio. Getting images is easy; you can\ndownload them in a lot of different ways.\nAnd then if you want to read data from them,\nsay for instance, you have a heat map of a\ncountry, you can go through it, but you will\nprobably have to write a program that loops\nthrough the image pixel-by-pixel to read the\ndata and them encode it numerically into your\nstatistical program. Now, that's my very brief\nsummary and let's summarize that. First off,\nif the data you are trying to get at doesn't\nhave an existing API, you can try scraping\nand you can write code in a language like\nR or Python. But, no matter what you do, be\nsensitive to issues of copyright and privacy,\nso you don't get yourself in hot water, but\ninstead, you make an analysis that can be\nof use to you or to your client. The next\nstep in data sourcing is making data. And\nspecifically, we're talking about getting\nnew data. I like to think of this as, you're\ngetting your hands on and you're getting \"data\nde novo,\" new data. So, can't find the data\nthat you need for your analysis? Well, one\nsimple solution is, do it yourself. And we're\ngoing to talk about a few general strategies\nused for doing that. Now, these strategies\nvary on a few dimensions. First off is the\nrole. Are you passive and simply observing\nstuff that's happening already, or are you\nactive where you play a role in creating the\nsituation to get the data? And then there's\nthe \"Q/Q question,\" and that is, are you going\nto get quantitative, or numerical, data, or\nare you going to get qualitative data, which\nusually means text, paragraphs, sentences\nas well as things like photos and videos and\naudio? And also, how are you going to get\nthe data? Do you want to get it online, or\ndo you want to get it in person? Now, there's\nother choices than these, but these are some\nof the big delineators of the methods. When\nyou look at those, you get a few possible\noptions. Number one is interviews, and I'll\nsay more about those. Another one is surveys.\nA third one is card sorting. And a fourth\none is experiments, although I actually want\nto split experiments into two kinds of categories.\nThe first one is laboratory experiments, and\nthat's in-person projects where you shape\nthe information or an experience for the participants\nas a way of seeing how that involvement changes\ntheir reactions. It doesn't necessarily mean\nthat you're a participant, but you create\nthe situation. And then there's also A/B testing.\nThis is automated, online testing of two or\nmore variations on a webpage. It's a very,\nvery simple kind of experimentation that's\nactually very useful for optimizing websites.\nSo, in sum, from this very short introduction\nmake sure you can get exactly what you need.\nGet the data you need to answer your question.\nAnd if you can't find it somewhere, then make\nit. And, as always, you have many possible\nmethods, each of which have their own strengths\nand their own compromises. And we'll talk\nabout each of those in the following sections.\nThe first method of data sourcing where you're\nmaking new data that I want to talk about\nis interviews. And that's not because it's\nthe most common, but because it's the one\nyou would do for the most basic problem. Now,\nbasically an interview is nothing more than\na conversation with another person or a group\nof people. And, the fundamental question is,\nwhy do interviews as opposed to doing a survey\nor something else? Well, there's a few good\nreasons to do that. Number one: you're working\nwith a new topic and you don't know what people's\nresponses will be, how they'll react. And\nso you need something very open-ended. Number\ntwo: you're working with a new audience and\nyou don't know how they will react in particular\nto what it is you're trying to do. And number\nthree: something's going on with the current\nsituation, it's not working anymore, and you\nneed to find what's going on, and you need\nto find ways to improve. The open-ended information\nwhere you get past you're existing categories\nand boundaries can be one of the most useful\nmethods for getting that data. If you want\nto put it another way, you want to do interviews\nwhen you don't want to constrain responses.\nNow, when it comes to interviews, you have\none very basic choice, and that's whether\nyou do a structured interview. And with a\nstructured interview, you have a predetermined\nset of questions, and everyone gets the same\nquestions in the same order. It gives a lot\nof consistency even though the responses are\nopen-ended. And then you can also have what's\ncalled an unstructured interview. And this\nis a whole lot more like a conversation where\nyou as the interviewer and the person you're\ntalking to - your questions arise in response\nto their answers. Consequently, an unstructured\ninterview can be different for each person\nthat you talk to. Also, interviews are usually\ndone in person, but not surprisingly, they\ncan be done over the phone, or often online.\nNow, a couple of things to keep in mind about\ninterviews. Number one is time. Interviews\ncan range from just a few minutes to several\nhours per person. Second is training. Interviewing's\na special skill that usually requires specific\ntraining. Now, asking the questions is not\nnecessarily the hard part. The really tricky\npart is the analysis. The hardest part of\ninterviews by far is analyzing the answers\nfor themes, and way of extracting the new\ncategories and the dimensions that you need\nfor your further research. The beautiful thing\nabout interviews is that they allow you to\nlearn things that you never expected. So,\nin sum: interviews are best for new situations\nor new audiences. On the other hand, they\ncan be time-consuming, and they also require\nspecial training; both to conduct the interview,\nbut also to analyze the highly qualitative\ndata that you get from them. The next logical\nstep in data sourcing and making data is surveys.\nNow, think of this: if you want to know something\njust ask. That's the easy way. And you want\nto do a survey under certain situations. The\nreal question is, do you know your topic and\nyour audience well enough to anticipate their\nanswers? To know what the range of their answers\nand the dimensions and the categories that\nare going to be important. If you do, then\na survey might be a good approach. Now, just\nas there were a few dimensions for interviews,\nthere are a few dimensions for surveys. You\ncan do what is called a closed-ended survey;\nthat is also called a forced choice. It is\nwhere you give people just particular options,\nlike a multiple choice. You can have an open-ended\nsurvey, where you have the same questions\nfor everybody, but you allow them to write\nin a free-form response. You can so surveys\nin person and you can also do them online\nor over the mail or phone or however. And\nnow, it is very common to use software when\ndoing surveys. Some really common applications\nfor online surveys are SurveyMonkey, and Qualtrics,\nor at the very simple end there is Google\nForms, and the simple and pretty end there\nis Typeform. There is a lot more choices,\nbut these are some of the major players and\nhow you can get data from online participants\nin survey format. Now, the nice thing about\nsurveys is, they are really easy to do, they\nare very easy to set up and they are really\neasy to send out to large groups of people.\nYou can get tons of data really fast. On the\nother hand, the same way that they are easy\nto do, they are also really easy to do badly.\nThe problem is that the questions you ask,\nthey can be ambiguous, they can be double-barreled,\nthey can be loaded and the response scales\ncan be confusing. So, if you say, \"I never\nthink this particular way\" and the person\nputs strongly disagree, they may not know\nexactly what you are trying to get at. So,\nyou have to take special effort to make sure\nthat the meaning is clear, unambiguous, and\nthat the rating scale, the way that people\nrespond, is very clear and they know where\ntheir answer falls. Which gets us into one\nof the things about people behaving badly\nand that is beware the push poll. Now, especially\nduring election time; like we are in right\nnow, a push poll is something that sounds\nlike a survey, but really what it is is a\nvery biased attempt to get data, just fodder\nfor social media campaigns or I am going to\nmake a chart that says that 98% of people\nagree with me. A push poll is one that is\nso biased, there is really only one way to\nanswer to the questions. This is considered\nextremely irresponsible and unethical from\na research point of view. Just hang up on\nthem. Now, aside from that egregious violation\nof research ethics, you do need to do other\nthings like watch out for bias in the question\nwording, in the response options, and also\nin the sample selection because any one of\nthose can push your responses off one way\nor another without you really being aware\nthat it is happening. So, in sum, let's say\nthis about surveys. You can get lots of data\nquickly, on the other hand, it requires familiarity\nwith the possible answers in your audience.\nSo, you know, sort of, what to expect. And\nno matter what you do, you need to watch for\nbias to make sure that your answers are going\nto be representative of the group that you\nare really concerned about understanding.\nAn interesting topic in Data Sourcing when\nyou are making data is Card Sorting. Now,\nthis isn't something that comes up very often\nin academic research, but in web research,\nthis can be a really important method. Think\nof it as what you are trying to do is like\nbuilding a model of a molecule here, you are\ntrying to build a mental model of people's\nmental structures. Put more specifically,\nhow do people organize information intuitively?\nAnd also, how does that relate to the things\nthat you are doing online? Now, the basic\nprocedure goes like this: you take a bunch\nof little topics and you write each one on\na separate card. And you can do this physically,\nwith like three by five cards, or there are\na lot of programs that allow you to do a digital\nversion of it. Then what you do is you give\nthis information to a group of respondents\nand the people sort those cards. So, they\nput similar topics with each other, different\ntopics over here and so on. And then you take\nthat information and from that you are able\nto calculate what is called, dissimilarity\ndata. Think of it as like the distance or\nthe difference between various topics. And\nthat gives you the raw data to analyze how\nthings are structured. Now, there are two\nvery general kinds of card sorting tasks.\nThere are generative and there's evaluative.\nA generative card sorting task is one in which\nrespondents create their own sets, their own\npiles of cards using any number of groupings\nthey like. And this might be used, for instance,\nto design a website. If people are going to\nbe looking for one kind of information next\nto another one, then you are going to want\nto put that together on the website, so they\nknow where to expect it. On the other hand,\nif you've already created a website, then\nyou can do an evaluative card sorting. This\nis where you have a fixed number or fixed\nnames of categories. Like for instance, the\nway you have set up your menus already. And\nthen what you do is you see if people actually\nput the cards into these various categories\nthat you have created. That's a way of verifying\nthat your hierarchical structure makes sense\nto people. Now, whichever method you do, generative\nor evaluative, what you end up with when you\ndo a card structure is an interesting kind\nof visualization called a Dendrogram. That\nactually means branches. And what we have\nhere is actually a hundred and fifty data\npoints; if you are familiar with the Fisher's\nIris data, that's what's going on here. And\nit groups it from one giant group on the left\nand then splits it in pieces and pieces and\npieces until you end up with lots of different\nobservations, well actually, individual-level\nobservations at the end. But you can cut things\noff into two or three groups or whatever is\nmost useful for you here, as a way of visualizing\nthe entire collection of similarity or dissimilarity\nbetween the individual pieces of information\nthat you had people sort. Now, I will just\nmention very quickly if you want to do a digital\ncard sorting, which makes your life infinitely\neasier because keeping track of physical cards\nis really hard. You can use something like\nOptimal Workshop, or UserZoom or UX Suite.\nThese are some of the most common choices.\nNow, let's just sum up what we've learned\nabout card sorting in this extremely brief\noverview. Number one, card sorting allows\nyou to see intuitive organization of information\nin a hierarchical format. You can do it with\nphysical cards or you can also have digital\nchoices for doing the same thing. And when\nyou are done, you actually get this hierarchical\nor branched visualization of how the information\nis structured and related to each other. When\nyou are doing your Data Sourcing and you are\nmaking data, sometimes you can't get what\nyou want through the easy ways, and you've\ngot to take the hard way. And you can do what\nI am calling laboratory experiments. Now of\ncourse, when I mention laboratory experiments\npeople start to think of stuff like, you know,\ndoctor Frankenstein in his lab, but lab experiments\nare less like this and in fact they are a\nlittle more like this. Nearly every experiment\nI have done in my career has been a paper\nand pencil one with people in a well-lighted\nroom and it's not been the threatening kind.\nNow, the reason you do a lab experiment is\nbecause you want to determine cause and effect.\nAnd this is the single most theoretically\nviable way of getting that information. Now,\nwhat makes an experiment an experiment is\nthe fact that researchers play active roles\nin experiments with manipulations. Now, people\nget a little freaked out when they hear manipulations,\nthink that you are coercing people and messing\nwith their mind. All that means is that you\nare manipulating the situation; you are causing\nsomething to be different for one group of\npeople or for one situation than another.\nIt's a benign thing, but it allows you to\nsee how people react to those different variations.\nNow, you are going to want to do an experiment,\nyou are going to want to have focused research,\nit is usually done to test one thing or one\nvariation at a time. And it is usually hypothesis-driven;\nusually you don't do an experiment until you\nhave done enough background research to say,\n\"I expect people to react this way to this\nsituation and this way to the other.\" A key\ncomponent to all of this is that experiments\nalmost always have random assignment regardless\nof how you got your sample, when they are\nin your study, you randomly assign them to\none condition or another. And what they does\nis it balances out the pre-existing differences\nbetween groups and that's a great way of taking\ncare of confounds and artifacts. The things\nthat are unintentionally associated with differences\nbetween groups that provide alternate explanations\nfor your data. If you have done good random\nassignment and you have a large enough group\nof people than those confounds and artifacts\nare basically minimized. Now, some places\nwhere you are likely to see laboratory experiments\nin this version are for instance are eye tracking\nand web design. This is where you have to\nbring people in front of a computer and you\nstick a thing there that sees where they are\nlooking. That's how we know for instance that\npeople don't really look at ads on the side\nof web pages. Another very common place is\nresearch in medicine and education and in\nmy field, psychology. And in all of these,\nwhat you find is that experimental research\nis considered the gold standard for reliable\nvalid information about cause and effect.\nOn the other hand, while it is a wonderful\nthing to have, it does come at a cost. Here's\nhow that works. Number 1, experimentation\nrequires extensive, specialized training.\nIt is not a simple thing to pick up. Two,\nexperiments are often very time consuming\nand labor intensive. I have known some that\ntake hours per person. And number three, experiments\ncan be very expensive. So, what that all means\nis that you want to make sure that you have\ndone enough background research and you need\nto have a situation where it is sufficiently\nimportant to get really reliable cause and\neffect information to justify these costs\nfor experimentation. In sum, laboratory experimentation\nis generally considered the best method for\ncausality or assessing causality. That's because\nit allows you to control for confounds through\nrandomization. On the other hand, it can be\ndifficult to do. So, be careful and thoughtful\nwhen considering whether you need to do an\nexperiment and how to actually go about doing\nit. There's one final procedure I want to\ntalk about in terms of Data Sourcing and Making\nNew Data. It's a form of experimentation and\nit is simply called A/B testing and it's extremely\ncommon in the web world. So, for instance,\nI just barely grabbed a screenshot of Amazon.com's\nhomepage and you're got these various elements\non the homepage and I just noticed, by the\nway, when I did this that this woman is actually\nan animated gif, so she moves around. That\nwas kind of weird; I have never seen that\nbefore. But the thing about this, is this\nentire layout, how things are organized and\nhow they are on there, will have been determined\nby variations on A/B testing by Amazon. Here's\nhow it works. For your webpage, you pick one\nelement like what's the headline or what are\nthe colors or what's the organization or how\ndo you word something and you create multiple\nversions, maybe just two version A and version\nB, why you call it A/B testing. Then when\npeople visit your webpage you randomly assign\nthese visitors to one version or another,\nyou have software that does that for you automatically.\nAnd then you compare the response rates on\nsome response. I will show you those in a\nsecond. And then, once you have enough data,\nyou implement the best version, you sort of\nset that one solid and then you go on to something\nelse. Now, in terms of response rates, there\nare a lot of different outcomes you can look\nat. You can look at how long a person is on\na page, you can actually do mouse tracking\nif you want to. You can look at click-throughs,\nyou can also look at shopping cart value or\nabandonment. A lot of possible outcomes. All\nof these contribute through A/B testing to\nthe general concept of website optimization;\nto make your website as effective as it can\npossibly be. Now, the idea also is that this\nis something that you are going to do a lot.\nYou can perform A/B tests continually. In\nfact, I have seen one person say that what\nA/B testing really stands for is always be\ntesting. Kind of cute, but it does give you\nthe idea that improvement is a constant process.\nNow, if you want some software to do A/B testing,\ntwo of the most common choices are Optimizely\nand VWO, which stands for Visual Web Optimizer.\nNow, many others are available, but these\nare especially common and when you get the\ndata you are going to use statistical hypothesis\ntesting to compare the differences or really\nthe software does it for you automatically.\nBut you may want to adjust the parameters\nbecause most software packages cut off testing\na little too soon and the information is not\nquite as reliable as it should be. But, in\nsum, here is what we can say about A/B testing.\nIt is a version of website experimentation;\nit is done online, which makes it really easy\nto get a lot of data very quickly. It allows\nyou to optimize the design of your website\nfor whatever outcome is important to you.\nAnd it can be done as a series of continual\nassessments, testing, and development to make\nsure that you're accomplishing what you want\nto as effectively as possible for as many\npeople as possible. The very last thing I\nwant to talk about in terms of data sourcing\nis to talk about the next steps. And probably\nthe most important thing is, you know, don't\njust sit there. I want you to go and see what\nyou already have. Try to explore some open\ndata sources. And if it helps, check with\na few data vendors. And if those don't give\nyou what you need to do your project, then\nconsider making new data. Again, the idea\nhere is get what you need and get going. Thanks\nfor joining me and good luck on your own projects.\nWelcome to \"Coding in Data Science\". I'm Bart\nPoulson and what we are going to do in this\nseries of videos is we're going to take a\nlittle look at the tools of Data Science.\nSo, I am inviting you to know your tools,\nbut probably even more important than that\nis to know their proper place. Now, I mention\nthat because a lot of the times when people\ntalk about data tools, they talk about it\nas though that were the same thing as data\nscience, as though they were the same set.\nBut, I think if you look at it for just a\nsecond that is not really the case. Data tools\nare simply one element of data science because\ndata science is made up of a lot more than\nthe tools that you use. It includes things\nlike, business knowledge, it includes the\nmeaning making and interpretation, it includes\nsocial factors and so there's much more than\njust the tools involved. That being said,\nyou will need at least a few tools and so\nwe're going to talk about some of the things\nthat you can use in data science if it works\nwell for you. In terms of getting started,\nthe basic things. #1 is spreadsheets, it is\nthe universal data tool and I'll talk about\nhow they play an important role in data science.\n#2 is a visualization program called Tableau,\nthere is Tableau public, which is free, and\nthere's Tableau desktop and there is also\nsomething called Tableau server. Tableau is\na fabulous program for data visualization\nand I'm convinced for most people provides\nthe great majority of what they need. And\nthough while it is not a tool, I do need to\ntalk about the formats used in web data because,\nyou have to be able to navigate that when\ndoing a lot of data science work. Then we\ncan talk about some of the essential tools\nfor data science. Those include the programming\nlanguage R, which is specifically for data,\nthere's the general purpose programming language\nPython, which has been well adapted to data.\nAnd there's the database language sequel or\nSQL for structured query language. Then if\nyou want to go beyond that, there are some\nother things that you can do. There are the\ngeneral purpose programming languages C, C++,\nand Java, which are very frequently used to\nform the foundation of data science and sort\nof high level production code is going to\nrely on those as well. There's the command\nline interface language Bash, which is very\ncommon, a very quick tool for manipulating\ndata. And then there's the, sort of wild card\nsupercharged regular expressions or Regex.\nWe'll talk about all of these in separate\ncourses. But, as you consider all the tools\nthat you can use, don't forget the 80/20 rule.\nAlso known as the Pareto Principle. And the\nidea here is that you are going to get a lot\nof bang for your buck out of small number\nof things. And I'm going to show you a little\nsample graph here. Imagine that you have ten\ndifferent tools and we'll call them A through\nB. A does a lot for you, B does a little bit\nless and it kind of tapers down to, you have\ngot a bunch of tools that do just a little\nof stuff that you need. Now, instead of looking\nat the individual effectiveness, look at the\ncumulative effectiveness. How much are you\nable to accomplish with a combination of tools?\nWell, the first ones right here at 60% where\nthe tools started and then you add on the\n20% from B and it goes up and then you add\non C and D and you add up little smaller,\nsmaller pieces and by the time you get to\nthe end, you have got 100% of effectiveness\nfrom your ten tools combined. The important\nthing about this is, you only have to go to\nthe 2nd tool, that is two out of ten, that's\nB, that's 20% of your tools and in this made\nup example, you have got 80% of your output.\nSo, 80% of the output from 20% of the tools,\nthat's a fictional example of the Pareto Principle,\nbut I find in real life it tends to work something\napproximately like that. And so, you don't\nnecessarily have to learn everything and you\ndon't have to learn how to do everything in\neverything. Instead you want to focus on the\ntools that will be most productive and specifically\nmost productive for you. So, in sum, let's\nsay these three things. Number 1, coding or\nsimply the ability to manipulate data with\nprograms and computers. Coding is important,\nbut data science is much greater than the\ncollection of tools that's used in it. And\nthen finally, as you're trying to decide what\ntools to use and what you need to learn and\nhow to work, remember the 80/20, you are going\nto get a lot of bang from a small set of tools.\nSo, focus on the things that are going to\nbe most useful for you in conducting your\nown data science projects. As we begin our\ndiscussion of Coding and Data Science, I actually\nwant to begin with something that's not coding.\nI want to talk about applications or programs\nthat are already created that allow you to\nmanipulate data. And we are going to begin\nwith the most basic of these, spreadsheets.\nWe're going to do the rows and columns and\ncells of Excel. And the reason for this is\nyou need spreadsheets. Now, you may be saying\nto yourself, \"no no no not me, because you\nknow what I'm fancy, I'm working in my big\nset of servers, I've got fancy things going\non.\" But, you know what, you too fancy people,\nyou need spreadsheets as well. There's a few\nreasons for this. Most importantly, spreadsheets\ncan be the right tool for data science in\na lot of circumstances; there are a few reasons\nfor that. Number one, spreadsheets, they're\neverywhere, they're ubiquitous, they're installed\non a billion machines around the world and\neverybody uses them. They probably have more\ndata sets in spreadsheets than anything else,\nand so it's a very common format. Importantly,\nit's probably your client's format; a lot\nof your clients are going to be using spreadsheets\nfor their own data. I've worked with billion\ndollar companies that keep all of their data\nin spreadsheets. So, when you're working with\nthem, you need to know how to manipulate that\nand how to work with it. Also, regardless\nof what you're doing, spreadsheets are specifically\ncsv - comma separated value files - are sort\nof the lingua franca or the universal interchange\nformat for data transfer, to allow you to\ntake it from one program to another. And then,\ntruthfully, in a lot of situations they're\nreally easy to use. And if you want a second\nopinion on this, let's take a look at this\nranking. There's a survey of data mining experts,\nit's the KDnuggets data mining poll, and these\nare the tools they most use in their own work.\nAnd look at this: lowly Excel is fifth on\nthe list, and in fact, what's interesting\nabout it is it's above Hadoop and Spark, two\nof the major big data fancy tools. And so,\nExcel really does have place of pride in a\ntoolkit for data analyst. Now, since we're\ngoing to sort of the low tech end of things,\nlet's talk about some of the things you can\ndo with a spreadsheet. Number one, they are\nreally good for data browsing. You really\nget to see all of the data in front of you,\nwhich isn't true if you are doing something\nlike R or Python. They're really good for\nsorting data, sort by this column then this\ncolumn then this column. They're really good\nfor rearranging columns and cells and moving\nthings around. They're good for finding and\nreplacing and seeing what happens so you know\nthat it worked right. Some more uses they're\nreally good for formatting, especially conditional\nformatting. They're good for transposing data,\nswitching the rows and the columns, they make\nthat really easy. They're good for tracking\nchanges. Now it's true if you're a big fancy\ndata scientist you're probably using GitHub,\nbut for everybody else in the world spreadsheets\nand the tracking changes is a wonderful way\nto do it. You can make pivot tables, that\nallows you to explore the data in a very hands-on\nway, in a very intuitive way. And they're\nalso really good for arranging the output\nfor consumption. Now, when you're working\nwith spreadsheets, however, there's one thing\nyou need to be aware of: they are really flexible,\nbut that flexibility can be a problem in that\nwhen you are working in data science, you\nspecifically want to be concerned about something\ncalled Tidy Data. That's a term I borrowed\nfrom Hadley Wickham, a very well-known developer\nin the R world. Tidy Data is for transferring\ndata and making it work well. There's a few\nrules here that undo some of the flexibility\ninherent in spreadsheets. Number one, what\nyou want to do is have a column be equivalent\nto the same thing as a variable; columns,\nvariables, they are the same thing. And then,\nrows are equal - exactly the same thing as\ncases. That you have one sheet per file, and\nthat you have one level of measurement, say,\nindividual, then organization, then state\nper file. Again, this is undoing some of the\nflexibility that's inherent in spreadsheets,\nbut it makes it really easy to move the data\nfrom one program to another. Let me show you\nhow all this works. You can try this in Excel.\nIf you have downloaded the files for this\ncourse, we simply want to open up this spreadsheet.\nLet me go to Excel and show you how it works.\nSo, when you open up this spreadsheet, what\nyou get is totally fictional data here that\nI made up, but it is showing sales over time\nof several products at two locations, like\nif you're selling stuff at a baseball field.\nAnd this is the way spreadsheets often appear;\nwe've got blank rows and columns, we've got\nstuff arranged in a way that makes it easy\nfor the person to process it. And we have\ngot totals here, with formulas putting them\nall together. And that's fine, that works\nwell for the person who made it. And then,\nthat's for one month and then we have another\nmonth right here and then we have another\nmonth right here and then we combine them\nall for first quarter of 2014. We have got\nsome headers here, we've got some conditional\nformatting and changes and if we come to the\nbottom, we have got a very busy line graphic\nthat eventually loads; it's not a good graphic,\nby the way. But, similar to what you will\noften find. So, this is the stuff that, while\nit may be useful for the client's own personal\nuse, you can't feed this into R or Python,\nit will just choke and it won't know what\nto do with it. And so, you need to go through\na process of tidying up the data. And what\nthis involves is undoing some of the stuff.\nSo, for instance, here's data that is almost\ntidy. Here we have a single column for date,\na single column for the day, a column for\nthe site, so we have two locations A and B,\nand then we have six columns for the six different\nthings that are sold and how many were sold\non each day. Now, in certain situations, you\nwould want the data laid out exactly like\nthis if you are doing, for instance, a time\nseries, you will do something vaguely similar\nto this. But, for true tidy stuff, we are\ngoing to collapse it even further. Let me\ncome here to the tidy data. And now what I\nhave done is, I have created a new column\nthat says what is the item being sold. And\nso, by the way, what this means is that we\nhave got a really long data set now, it has\ngot over a thousand rows. Come back up to\nthe top here. But, what that shows you is\nthat now it's in a format that's really easy\nto import from one program to another, that\nmakes it tidy and you can re-manipulate it\nhowever you want once you get to each of those.\nSo, let's sum up our little presentation here,\nin a few lines. Number one, no matter who\nyou are, no matter what you are doing in data\nscience you need spreadsheets. And the reason\nfor that is that spreadsheets are often the\nright tool for data science. Keep one thing\nin mind though, that is as you are moving\nback and forth from one language to another,\ntidy data or well-formatted data is going\nto be important for exporting data into your\nanalytical programmer language of choice.\nAs we move through \"Coding and Data Science,\"\nand specifically the applications that can\nbe used, there's one that stands out for me\nmore than almost anything else, and that's\nTableau and Tableau Public. Now, if you are\nnot familiar with these, these are visualization\nprograms. The idea here is that when you have\ndata, the most important thing you can do\nis to first look and see what you have and\nwork with it from there. And in fact, I'm\nconvinced that for many organizations Tableau\nmight be all that they really need. It will\ngive them the level of insight that they need\nto work constructively with data. So, let's\ntake a quick look by going to tableau.com.\nNow, there are a few different versions of\nTableau. Right here we have Tableau Desktop\nand Tableau Server, and these are the paid\nversions of Tableau. They actually cost a\nlot of money, unless you work for a nonprofit\norganization, in which case you can get them\nfor free. Which is a beautiful thing. What\nwe're usually looking for, however, is not\nthe paid version, but we are looking for something\ncalled Tableau Public. And if you come in\nhere and go to products and we have got these\nthree paid ones, over here to Tableau Public.\nWe click on that, it brings us to this page.\nIt is public.tableau.com. And this is the\none that has what we want, it's the free version\nof Tableau with one major caveat: you don't\nsave files locally to your computer, which\nis why I didn't give you a file to open. Instead,\nit saves them to the web in a public form.\nSo, if you are willing to trade privacy, you\ncan get an immensely powerful application\nfor data visualization. That's a catch for\na lot of people, which is why people are willing\nto pay a lot of money for the desktop version.\nAnd again, if you work for a nonprofit you\ncan get the desktop version for free. But,\nI am going to show you how things work in\nTableau Public. So, that's something that\nyou can work with personally. The first thing\nyou want to do is, you want to download it.\nAnd so, you put in your email address, you\ndownload; it is going to know what you are\non. It is a pretty big download. And once\nit is downloaded, you can install and open\nup the application. And here I am in Tableau\nPublic, right here, this is the blank version.\nBy the way, you also need to create an account\nwith Tableau in order to save your stuff online\nto see it. I will show you what that looks\nlike. But, you are presented with a blank\nthing right here and the first thing you need\nto do is, you need to bring in some data.\nI'm going to bring in an Excel file. Now,\nif you downloaded the files for the course,\nyou will see that there is this one right\nhere, DS03_2_2_TableauPublic.excel.xlsx. In\nfact, it is the one that I used in talking\nabout spreadsheets in the first video in this\ncourse. I'm going to select that one and I'm\ngoing to open it. And a lot of programs don't\nlike bringing in Excel because it's got all\nthe worksheets and all the weirdness in it.\nThis one works better with it, but what I'm\ngoing to do is, I am going to take the tidy\ndata. By the way, you see that it put them\nin alphabetical order here. I'm going to take\ntidy data and I'm going to drag it over to\nlet it know that it's the one that I want.\nAnd now what it does is it shows me a version\nof the data set along with things that you\ncan do here. You can rename it, I like that\nyou can create bin groups, there's a lot of\nthings that you can do here. I'm going to\ndo something very, very quick with this particular\none. Now, I've got the data set right here,\nwhat I'm going to do now is I'm going to go\nto a worksheet. That's where you actually\ncreate stuff. Cancel that and go to worksheet\none. Okay. This is a drag and drop interface.\nAnd so what we are going to do is, we are\ngoing to pull the bits and pieces of information\nwe want to make graphics. There's immense\nflexibility here. I'm going to show you two\nvery basic ones. I'm going to look at the\nsales of my fictional ballpark items. So,\nI'm going to grab sales right here and I'm\ngoing to put that as the field that we are\ngoing to measure. Okay. And you see, put it\ndown right here and this is our total sales.\nWe're going to break it down by item and by\ntime. So, let me take item right here, and\nyou can drag it over here, or I can put it\nright up here into rows. Those will be my\nrows and that will be how many we have sold\ntotal of each of the items. Fine, that's really\neasy. And then, let's take date and we will\nput that here in columns to spread it across.\nNow, by default it is doing it by year, I\ndon't want to do that, I want to have three\nmonths of data. So, what I can do is, I can\nclick right here and I can choose a different\ntime frame. I can go to quarter, but that's\nnot going to help because I only have one\nquarter's worth of data, that's three months.\nI'm going to come down to week. Actually,\nlet me go to day. If I do day, you see it\ngets enormously complicated, so that's no\ngood. So, I'm going to back up to week. And\nI've got a lot of numbers there, but what\nI want is a graph. And so, to get that, I'm\ngoing to come over here and click on this\nand tell it that I want a graph. And so, we're\nseeing the information, except it lost items.\nSo, I'm going to bring item and put it back\nup into this graph to say this is a row for\nthe data. And now I've got rows for sales\nby week for each of my items. That's great.\nI want to break it down one more by putting\nin the site, the place that it sold. So, I'm\ngoing to grab that and I'm going to put it\nright over here. And now you see I've got\nit broken down by the item that is sold and\nthe different sites. I'm going to color the\nsites, and all I've got to do to do that is,\nI'm going to grab site and drag it onto color.\nNow, I've got two different colors for my\nsites. And this makes it a lot easier to tell\nwhat is going on. And in fact, there is some\nother cool stuff you can do. One of the things\nI'm going to do is come over here to analytics\nand I can tell it to put an average line through\neverything, so I'll just drag this over here.\nNow we have the average for each line. That's\ngood. And I can even do forecasting. Let me\nget a little bit of a forecast right here.\nI will drag this on and if you can go over\nhere. I will get this out of the way for a\nsecond. Now, I have a forecast for the next\nfew weeks, and that's a really convenient,\nquick, and easy thing. And again, for some\norganizations that might be all that they\nreally need. And so, what I'm showing you\nhere is the absolute basic operation of Tableau,\nwhich allows you to do an incredible range\nof visualizations and manipulate the data\nand create interactive dashboards. There's\nso much to it and we'll show that in another\ncourse, but for right now I want to show you\none last thing about Tableau Public, and that\nis saving the files. So now, when I come here\nand save it, it's going to ask me to sign\ninto Tableau Public. Now, I sign in and it\nasks me how I want to save this, same name\nas the video. There we go, and I'm going to\nhit save. And then that opens up a web browser,\nand since I'm already logged into my account,\nsee here's my account and my profile. Here's\nthe page that I created. And it's got everything\nthat I need there; I'm going to edit just\na few details. I'm going to say, for instance,\nI'm going to leave its name just like that.\nI can put more of a description in there if\nI wanted. I can allow people to download the\nworkbook and its data; I'm going to leave\nthat there so you can download it if you need\nto. If I had more than one tab, I would do\nthis thing that says show the different sheets\nas tabs. Hit save. And there's my data set\nand also it's published online and people\ncan now find it. And so what you have here\nis an incredible tool for creating interactive\nvisualizations; you can create them with drop-down\nmenus, and you can rearrange things, and you\ncan make an entire dashboard. It's a fabulous\nway of presenting information, and as I said\nbefore, I think that for some organizations\nthis may be as much as they need to get really\ngood, useful information out of their data.\nAnd so I strongly recommend that you take\nsome time to explore with Tableau, either\nthe paid desktop version or the public version\nand see what you can do to get some really\ncompelling and insightful visualizations out\nof your work in data science. For many people,\ntheir first experience of \"Coding and Data\nScience\" is with the application SPSS. Now,\nI think of SPSS and the first thing that comes\nto my mind is sort of life in the Ivory tower,\nthough this looks more like Harry Potter.\nBut, if you think about it the package name\nSPSS comes from Statistical Package for the\nSocial Sciences. Although, if you ask IBM\nabout it now, they act like it doesn't stand\nfor anything. But, it has its background in\nsocial science research which is generally\nacademic. And truthfully, I'm a social psychologist\nand that's where I first learned how to use\nSPSS. But, let's take a quick look at their\nwebpage ibm.com/spss. If you type that in,\nthat will just be an alias that will take\nyou to IBM's main webpage. Now, IBM didn't\ncreate SPSS, but they bought it around version\n16, and it was very briefly known as PASW\npredictive analytic software, that only lasted\nbriefly and now it's back to SPSS, which is\nwhere it's been for a long time. SPSS is a\ndesktop program; it's pretty big, it does\na lot of things, it's very powerful, and is\nused in a lot of academic research. It's also\nused in a lot of business consulting, management,\neven some medical research. And the thing\nabout SPSS, is it looks like a spreadsheet\nbut has drop-down menus to make your life\na little bit easier compared to some of the\nprogramming languages that you can use. Now,\nyou can get a free temporary version, if you're\na student you can get a cheap version, otherwise\nSPSS costs a lot of money. But, if you have\nit one way or another, when you open it up\nthis is what it is going to look like. I'm\nshowing SPSS version 22, now it's currently\non 24. And the thing about SPSS versioning\nis, in anything other than software packaging,\nthese would be point updates, so I sort of\nfeel like we should be on 17.3, as opposed\nto 23 or 24. Because the variations are so\nsmall that anything you learn from the early\nones, is going to work on the later ones and\nthere is a lot of backwards and forwards compatibility,\nso I'd almost say that this one, the version\nI have practically doesn't matter. You get\nthis little welcome splash screen, and if\nyou don't want to see it anymore you can get\nrid of it. I'm just going to hit cancel here.\nAnd this is our main interface. It looks a\nlot like a spreadsheet, the difference is,\nyou have a separate pane for looking at variable\ninformation and then you have separate windows\nfor output and then an optional one for something\ncalled Syntax. But, let me show you how this\nworks by first opening up a data set. SPSS\nhas a lot of sample data sets in them, but\nthey are not easy to get to and they are really\nwell hidden. On my Mac, for instance, let\nme go to where they are. In my mac I go to\nthe finder, I have to go to Mac, to applications,\nto the folder IBM, to SPSS, to statistics,\nto 22 the version number, to samples, then\nI have to say I want the ones that are in\nEnglish, and then it brings them up. The .sav\nfiles are the actual data files, there are\ndifferent kinds in here, so .sav is a different\nkind of file and then we have a different\none about planning analyses. So, there are\nversions of it. I'm going to open up a file\nhere called \"market values .sav,\" a small\ndata set in SPSS format. And if you don't\nhave that, you can open up something else;\nit really doesn't matter for now. By the way,\nin case you haven't noticed, SPSS tends to\nbe really really slow when it opens. It also,\ndespite being version 24, it tends to be kind\nof buggy and crashes. So, when you work with\nSPSS, you want to get in the habit of saving\nyour work constantly. And also, being patient\nwhen it is time to open the program. So, here\nis a data set that just shows addresses and\nhouse values, and square feet for information.\nThis, I don't even know if this is real information,\nit looks artificial to me. But, SPSS lets\nyou do point and click analyses, which is\nunusual for a lot of things. So, I am going\nto come up here and I am going to say, for\ninstance, make a graph. I'm going to make\na- I'm going to use what is called a legacy\ndialogue to get a histogram of house prices.\nSo, I simply click values. Put that right\nthere and I will put a normal curve in top\nof it and click ok. This is going to open\nup a new window, and it opened up a microscopic\nversion of it, so I'm going to make that bigger.\nThis is the output window, this is a separate\nwindow and it has a navigation pane here on\nthe side. It tells me where the data came\nfrom, and it saves the command here, and then,\nyou know, there's my default histogram. So,\nwe see most of the houses were right around\n$125,000, and then they went up to at least\n$400,000. I have a mean of $256,000, a standard\ndeviation of about $80,000, and then there\nis 94 houses in the data set. Fine, that's\ngreat. The other thing I can do is, if I want\nto do some analyses, let me go back to the\ndata just for a moment. For instance, I can\ncome here to analyze and I can do descriptive\nand I'm actually going to do one here called\nExplore. And I'll take the purchase price\nand I'll put it right here and I'm going to\nget a whole bunch just by default. I'm going\nto hit ok. And it goes back to the output\nwindow. Once again made it tiny. And so, now\nyou see beneath my chart I now have a table\nand I've got a bunch of information. A stem\nand leaf plot, and a box plot too, a great\nway of checking for outliers. And so this\nis a really convenient way to save things.\nYou can export this information as images,\nyou can export the entire file as an HTML,\nyou can do it as a pdf or a PowerPoint. There's\na lot of options here and you can customize\neverything that's on here. Now, I just want\nto show you one more thing that makes your\nlife so much easier in SPSS. You see right\nhere that it's putting down these commands,\nit's actually saying graph, and then histogram,\nand normal equals value. And then down here,\nwe've got this little command right here.\nMost people don't know how to save their work\nin SPSS, and that's something you kind of\njust have to do it over again every time,\nbut there's a very simple way to do this.\nWhat I'm going to do is, I'm going to open\nup something called a Syntax file. I'm going\nto go to new, Syntax. And this is just a blank\nwindow that's a programming window, it's for\nsaving code. And let me go back to my analysis\nI did a moment ago. I'll go back to analyze\nand I can still get at it right here. Descriptives\nand explore, my information is still there.\nAnd what happens here is, even though I set\nit up with drop-down menus and point and click,\nif I do this thing, paste, then what it does\nis, it takes the code that creates that command\nand it saves it to this syntax window. And\nthis is just a text file. It saves it as .spss,\nbut it is a text file that can be opened in\nanything. And what's beautiful about this\nis, it is really easy to copy and paste, and\nyou can even take this into Word and do a\nfind and replace on it, and it's really easy\nto replicate the analyses. And so for me,\nSPSS is a good program. But, until you use\nSyntax you don't know the true power of it\nand it makes your life so much easier as a\nway of operating it. Anyhow, this is my extremely\nbrief introduction to SPSS. All I want to\nsay is that it is a very common program, kind\nof looks like a spreadsheet, but it gives\nyou a lot more power and options and you can\nuse both drop-down menus and text-based Syntax\ncommands as well to automate your work and\nmake it easier to replicate it in the future.\nI want to take a look at one more application\nfor \"Coding and Data Science\", that's called\nJASP. This is a new application, not very\nfamiliar to a lot of people and still in beta,\nbut with an amazing promise. You can basically\nthink of it as a free version of SPSS and\nyou know what, we love free. But, JASP is\nnot just free, it's also open source, and\nit's intuitive, and it makes analyses replicable,\nand it even includes Bayesian approaches.\nSo, take that all together, you know, we're\npretty happy and we're jumping for joy. So,\nbefore we move on, you just may be asking\nyourself, JASP, what is that? Well, the creator\nhas emphatically denied that it stands for\nJust Another Statistics Program, but be that\nas it may, we will just go ahead and call\nit JASP and use it very happily. You can get\nto it by going to jasp-stats.org. And let's\ntake a look at that right now. JASP is a new\nprogram, they say a low fat alternative to\nSPSS, but it is a really wonderful great way\nof doing statistics. You're going to want\nto download it, by supplying your platform;\nit even comes in Linux format, which is beautiful.\nAnd again, it's beta so stay posted, things\nare updating regularly. If you're on Mac,\nyou're going to need to use Xquartz, that's\nan easy thing to install and it makes a lot\nof things work better. And it's the wonderful\nway to do analyses. When you open up JASP,\nit's going to look like this. It's a pretty\nblank interface, but it's really easy to get\ngoing with it. So for instance, you can come\nover here to file and you can even choose\nsome example data sets. So for instance, here's\none called Big 5 that's personality factors.\nAnd you've got data here that's really easy\nto work with. Let me scroll this over here\nfor a moment. So, there's our five variables\nand let's do some quick analyses with these.\nSay for instance, we want to get descriptives;\nwe can pick a few variables. Now, if you're\nfamiliar with SPSS, the layout feels very\nmuch the same and the output looks a lot the\nsame. You know, all I have to do is select\nwhat I want and it immediately pops up over\nhere. Then I can choose additional statistics,\nI can get core tiles, I can get the median.\nAnd you can choose plots; let's get some plots,\nall you have to do is click on it and they\nshow up. And that's a really beautiful thing\nand you can modify these things a little bit,\nso for instance, I can take the plot points.\nLet's see if I can drag that down and if I\nmake it small enough I can see the five plots,\nI went a little too far on that one. Anyhow,\nyou can do a lot of things here. And I can\nhide this, I can collapse that and I can go\non and do other analyses. Now, what's really\nneat though is when I navigate away, so I\njust clicked in a blank area of the results\npage, we are back to the data here. But if\nI click on one of these tables, like this\none right here, it immediately brings up the\ncommands that produced it and I can just modify\nit some more if I want. Say I want skewness\nand kurtosis, boom they are in there. It is\nan amazing thing and then I can come back\nout here, I can click away from that and I\ncan come down to the plots expand those and\nif I click on that it brings up the commands\nthat made them. It's an amazingly easy and\nintuitive way to do things. Now, there's another\nreally nice thing about JASP and that is that\nyou can share the information online really\nwell through a program called osf.io. That\nstands for the open science foundation, that's\nits web address osf.io. So, let's take a quick\nlook at what that's like. Here's the open\nscience framework website and it's a wonderful\nservice, it's free and it's designed to support\nopen, transparent, accessible, accountable,\ncollaborative research and I really can't\nsay enough nice things about it. What's neat\nabout this is once you sign up for OSF you\ncan create your own area and I've got one\nof my own, I will go to that now. So, for\ninstance, here's the datalab page in open\nscience framework. And what I've done is i\ncreated a version of this JASP analysis and\nI've saved it here, in fact, let's open up\nmy JASP analysis in JASP and I'll show you\nwhat it looks like in osf. So, let's first\ngo back to JASP. When we're here we can come\nover to file and click computer and I just\nsaved this file to the desktop. Click on desktop,\nand you should have been able to download\nthis with all the other files, DS03_2_4_JASP,\ndouble click on that to open it and now it's\ngoing to open up a new window and you see\nI was working with the same data set, but\nI did a lot more analyses. I've got these\ngraphs; I have correlations and scatter plots.\nCome down here, I did a linear regression.\nAnd we just click on that and you can see\nthe commands that produce it as well as the\noptions. I didn't do anything special for\nthat, but I did do some confidence intervals\nand specified that and it's really a great\nway to work with all this. I'll click back\nin an empty area and you see the commands\ngo away and so I've got my output here in\nJASP, but when I saved it though, I had the\noption of saving it to OSF, in fact if you\ngo to this webpage osf.io/3t2jg you'll actually\nbe able to go to the page where you can see\nand download the analyses that I conducted,\nlet's take a look. This is that page, there's\nthe address I just barely gave you and what\nyou see here is the same analysis that I conducted,\nit's all right here, so if you're collaborating\nwith people or if you want to show things\nto people, this is a wonderful way to do it.\nEverything is right there, this is a static\nimage, but up at the top people have the option\nof downloading the original file and working\nwith it on their own. In case you can't tell,\nI'm really enthusiastic about JASP and about\nits potential, still in beta, still growing\nrapidly. I see it really as an open source\nfree and collaborative replacement to SPSS\nand I think it is going to make data science\nwork so much easier for so many people. I\nstrongly recommend you give JASP a close look.\nLet's finish up our discussion of \"Coding\nand Data Science\" the applications part of\nit by just briefly looking at some other software\nchoices. And I'll have to admit it gets kind\nof overwhelming because there are just so\nmany choices. Now, in addition to the spreadsheets,\nand Tableau, and SPSS, and JASP, that we have\nalready talked about, there's so much more\nthan that. I'm going to give you a range of\nthings that I'm aware of and I'm sure I've\nleft out some important ones or things that\nother people like really well, but these are\nsome common choices and some less common,\nbut interesting ones. Number one, in terms\nof ones that I haven't mentioned is SAS. SAS\nis an extremely common analytical program,\nvery powerful, used for a lot of things. It's\nactually the first program that I learned\nand on the other hand it can be kind of hard\nto use and it can be expensive, but there's\na couple of interesting alternatives. SAS\nalso has something called the SAS University\nEdition, if you're a student this is free\nand it's slightly reduced in what it does,\nbut the fact that it's free. And also it runs\nin a virtual machine which makes it an enormous\ndownload, but it's a good way to learn SAS\nif it's something that you want to do. SAS\nalso makes a program that I really love were\nit not so extraordinarily expensive and that\nis called JMP and its visualization software.\nThink a little bit of Tableau, how we saw\nit, you work with it visually and this one\nyou can drag things around, it's really wonderful\nprogram. I personally find it prohibitively\nexpensive. Another very common choice among\nworking analysts is Stata and some people\nuse Minitab. Now, for mathematical people,\nthere's MATLAB and then of course there's\nMathematica itself, but it is really more\nof a language than a program. On the other\nhand, Wolfram; who makes Mathematica, is also\nthe people who give us Wolfram Alpha, most\npeople don't think of this a stats application\nbecause you can run it on your iPhone. But,\nWolfram Alpha is an incredibly capable and\nespecially if you pay for the pro account,\nyou can do amazing things in this, including\nanalyses, regression models, visualizations\nand so it's worth taking a little closer look\nat that. Also, because it provides a lot of\nthe data that you need so Wolfram Alpha is\nan interesting one. Now, several applications\nthat are more specifically geared towards\ndata mining, so you don't want to do your\nregular, you know, little t tests and stuff\non these. But, there's RapidMiner and there's\nKNIME and Orange and those are all really\nnice to use because they are control languages\nwhere you drag notes onto a screen and you\nconnect them with lines and you can see how\nthings run through. All three of them are\nfree or have free versions and all three of\nthem work in pretty similar manners. There's\nalso BigML, which is for machine learning\nand this is unusual because it's browser based,\nit runs on their servers. There's a free version,\nthough you can't download a whole lot, it\ndoesn't cost a lot to use BigML and it's a\nvery friendly, very accessible program. Then\nin terms of programs you can actually install\nfor free on your own computer, there's one\ncall SOFA Statistics, it means statistics\nopen for all, it's kind of a cheesy title,\nbut it's a good program. And then one with\na web page straight out of 1990 is Past 3,\nthis is paleontological software, on the other\nhand does do very general stuff, it runs on\nmany platforms and it's a really powerful\nthing and it's free, but it is relatively\nunknown. And then speaking of relatively unknown,\none that's near and dear to my heart is a\nweb application called Statcrunch, it costs,\nbut it costs like $6 or $12 a year, it's really\ncheap and it's very good, especially if for\nbasic statistics and for learning, I used\nin some of the classes that I was teaching.\nAnd then if you're deeply wedded to Excel\nand you can't stand to leave that environment,\nyou can purchase add-ons like XLSTAT, which\ngive you a lot of statistical functions within\nthe Excel environment itself. That's a lot\nof choices and the most important thing here\nis don't get overwhelmed. There's a lot of\nchoices, but you don't even have to try all\nof them. Really the important question is\nwhat works best for you and the project that\nyou're working on? Here's a few things you\nwant to consider in that regard. First off\nis functionality, does it actually do what\nyou want or does it even run on your machine?\nYou don't need everything that a program can\ndo. When you think about the stuff Excel can\ndo, people probably use five percent of what's\navailable. Second is ease of use. Some of\nthese programs are a lot easier to use than\nthe others and I personally find that the\nones that are easier to use, I like them,\nso you might say, \"No, I need to program because\nI need custom stuff\". But I'm willing to bet\nthat 95% of what people do does not require\nanything custom. Also, the existence of a\ncommunity. Constantly when you're working\nyou come across problems and don't know how\nto solve it and being able to get online and\ndo a search for an answer and have enough\nof a community that there are people there\nwho have put answers up and discuss these\nthings. Those are wonderful. Some of these\nprograms are very substantial communities\nand some of them it is practically nonexistent\nand it is to you to decide how important it\nis to you. And then finally of course there\nis the issue of cost. Many of these programs\nI mentioned are free, some of them are very\ncheap, some of them run some sort of premium\nmodel and some of them are extremely expensive.\nSo, you don't buy them unless somebody else\nis paying for it. So, these are some of the\nthings that you want to keep in mind when\nyou're trying to look at various programs.\nAlso, let's mention this; don't forget the\n80/20 rule. You're going to be able to do\nmost of the stuff that you need to do with\nonly a small number of tools, one or two,\nmaybe three, will probably be all that you\never need. So, you don't need to explore the\nrange of every possible tool. Find something\nthat you need, find something you're comfortable\nwith and really try to extract as much value\nas you can out of that. So, in sum, in our\ndiscussion of available applications for coding\nand data science. First remember applications\nare tools, they don't drive you, you use them.\nAnd that your goals are what drive the choice\nof your applications and the way that you\ndo it. And the single most important thing\nis to remember, what works for you, may work\nwell for somebody else, if you're not comfortable\nwith it, if it's not the questions you address,\nthen it's more important to think about what\nworks for you and the projects that you're\nworking on as you make your own choices for\ntools, for working in data science. When you're\n\"Coding in Data Science,\" one of the most\nimportant things you can do is be able to\nwork with web data. And if you work with web\ndata you're going to be working with HTML.\nAnd in case you're not familiar with it, HTML\nis what makes the World Wide Web go ‘round.\nWhat it stands for is HyperText Markup Language\n- and if you've never dealt with web pages\nbefore, here's a little secret: web pages\nare just text. It is just a text document,\nbut it uses tags to define the structure of\nthe document and a web browser knows what\nthose tags are and it displays them the right\nway. So, for instance, some of the tags, they\nlook like this. They are in angle brackets,\nand you have an angle bracket and then the\nbeginning tag, so body, and then you have\nthe body, the main part of your text, and\nthen you have in angle brackets with backslash\nbody to let the computer know that you are\ndone with that part. You also have p and backslash\np for paragraphs. H1 is for header one and\nyou put it in between that text. TD is for\ntable data or the cell in a table and you\nmark it off that way. If you want to see what\nit looks like just go to this document: DS03_3_1_HTML.txt.\nI'm going to go to that one right now. Now,\ndepending on what text editor you open this\nup, it may actually give you the web preview.\nI've opened it up in TextMate and so it actually\nis showing the text the way I typed it. I\ntyped this manually; I just typed it all in\nthere. And I have HTML to see what a document\nis, I have an empty header, but that sort\nof needs to be there. This, I say what the\nbody is, and then I have some text. li is\nfor list items, I have headers, this is for\na link to a webpage, then I have a small table.\nAnd if you want to see what this looks like\nwhen displayed as a web page, just go up here\nto window and show web preview. This is the\nsame document, but now it is in a browser\nand that's how you make a web page. Now, I\nknow this is very fundamental stuff, but the\nreason this is important is because if you're\ngoing to be extracting data from the web,\nyou have to understand how that information\nis encoded in the web, and it is going to\nbe in HTML most of the time for a regular\nweb page. Now, I will mention something that,\nthere's another thing called CSS. Web pages\nuse CSS to define the appearance of a document.\nHTML is theoretically there to give the content\nand CSS gives the appearance. And that stands\nfor Cascading Style Sheets. I'm not going\nto worry about that right now because we're\nreally interested in the content. And now\nyou have the key to being able to read web\npages and pull data from web pages for your\ndata science project. So, in sum; first, the\nweb runs on HTML and that's what makes the\nweb pages that are there. HTML defines the\npage structure and the content that is on\nthe page. And you need to learn how to navigate\nthe tags and the structure in order to get\ndata from the web pages for your data science\nprojects. The next step in \"Coding and Data\nScience\" when you're working with web data\nis to understand a little bit about XML. I\nlike to think of this as the part of web data\nthat follows the imperative, \"Data, define\nthyself\". XML stands for eXtensible Markup\nLanguage, and what it is XML is semi-structured\ndata. What that means is that tags define\ndata so a computer knows what a particular\npiece of information is. But, unlike HTML,\nthe tags are free to be defined any way you\nwant. And so you have this enormous flexibility\nin there, but you're still able to specify\nit so the computer can read it. Now, there's\na couple of places where you're going to see\nXML files. Number one is in web data. HTML\ndefines the structure of a web page, but if\nthey're feeding data into it, then that will\noften come in the form of an XML file. Interestingly,\nMicrosoft Office files, if you have .docx\nor .xlsx, the X-part at the end stands for\na version of XML that's used to create these\ndocuments. If you use iTunes, the library\ninformation that has all of your artists,\nand your genre's, and your ratings and stuff,\nthat's all stored in an XML file. And then\nfinally, data files that often go with particular\nprograms can be saved as XML as a way of representing\nthe structure of the data to the program.\nAnd for XML, tags use opening and closing\nangle brackets just like HTML did. Again,\nthe major difference is that you're free to\ndefine the tags however you want. So for instance,\nthinking about iTunes, you can define a tag\nthat's genre, and you have the angle brackets\nin genre to begin that information, and then\nyou have the angle brackets with the backslash\nto let it know you're done with that piece\nof information. Or, you can do it for composer,\nor you can do it for rating, or you can do\nit for comments, and you can create any tags\nyou want and you put the information in between\nthose two things. Now, let's take an example\nof how this works. I'm going to show you a\nquick dataset that comes from the web. It's\nat ergast.com and API, and this is a website\nthat stores information about automobile Formula\nOne racing. Let's go to this webpage and take\na quick look at what it's like. So, here we\nare at Ergast.com, and it's the API for Formula\nOne. And what I'm bringing up is the results\nof the 1957 season in Formula One racing.\nAnd here you can see who the competitors were\nin each race, and how they finished and so\non. So, this is a dataset that is being displayed\nin a web page. If you want to see what it\nlooks like in XML, all you have to do is type\nXML onto the end of this: .XML. I've done\nthat already, so I'm just going to go to that\none. And as you see, it's only this bit that\nI've added: .XML. Now, it looks exactly the\nsame because the web page is structuring XML\ndata by default but if you want to see what\nit looks like in its raw format, just do an\noption, click on the web page, and go to view\npage source. At least that's how it works\nin Chrome, and this is the structured XML\npage. And you can see we have tags here. It\nsays Race Name, Circuit Name, Location, and\nobviously, these are not standard HTML tags.\nThey are defined for the purposes of this\nparticular dataset. But we begin with one.\nWe have Circuit Name right there, and then\nwe close it using the backslash right there.\nAnd so this is structured data; the computer\nknows how to read it, which is exactly, this\nis how it displays it by default. So, it's\na really good way of displaying data and its\na good way to know how to pull data from the\nweb. You can actually use what is called an\nAPI, an Application Programming interface\nto access this XML data and it pulls it in\nalong with its structure which makes working\nwith it really easy. What's even more interesting\nis how easy it is to take XML data and convert\nit between different formats, because it's\nstructured and the computer knows what you're\ndealing with. So for example, one it's really\neasy to convert XML to CSV or comma separated\nvalue files (that's the spreadsheet format)\nbecause it knows exactly what the headings\nare; what piece of information goes in each\ncolumn. Example two: it's really easy to convert\nHTML documents to XML because you can think\nof HTML with its restricted set of tags as\nsort of a subset of the much freer XML. And\nthree, you can convert CSV, or your spreadsheet\ncomma separated value, to XML and vice versa.\nYou can bounce them all back and forth because\nthe structure is made clear to the programs\nyou're working with. So in sum, here's what\nwe can say. Number one, XML is semi-structured\ndata. What that means is that it has tags\nto tell the computer what the piece of information\nis, but you can make the tags whatever you\nwant them to be. And, XML is very common for\nweb data and it's really easy to translate\nthe format XML/HTML/CSV so on and so forth.\nIt's really easy to translate them back and\nforth which gives you a lot of flexibility\nin manipulating data so can get into the format\nyou need for your own analysis. The last thing\nI want to mention about \"Coding and Data Science\"\nand web data is something called JSON. And\nI like to think of it as a version of smaller\nis better. Now, what JSON stands for is JavaScript\nObject Notation, although JavaScript is supposed\nto be one word. And what it is, is that like\nXML, JSON is semi-structured data. That is,\nyou have tags that define the data, so the\ncomputer knows what each piece of information\nis, but like XML the tags can vary freely.\nAnd so there's a lot in common between XML\nand JSON. So XML is a Markup Language (that's\nwhat the ML stands for), and that gives meaning\nto the text; it lets the computer know what\neach piece of information is. Also, XML allows\nyou to make comments in the document, and\nit allows you to put metadata in the tags\nso you can actually put information there\nin the angle brackets to provide additional\ncontext. JSON, on the other hand, is specifically\ndesigned for data interchange and so it's\ngot that special focus. And the structure;\nJSON corresponds with data structures, you\nknow it directly represents objects and arrays\nand numbers and strings and booleans, and\nthat works really well with the programs that\nare used to analyze data. Also, JSON is typically\nshorter than XML because it does not require\nthe closing tags. Now, there are ways to do\nthat with XML, but that's not typically how\nit's done. As a result of these differences,\nJSON is basically taking XML's place in web\ndata. XML still exists, it's still used for\na lot of things, but JSON is slowly replacing\nit. And we'll take a look at the comparison\nbetween the three by going back to the example\nwe used in XML. This is data about Formula\nOne car races in 1957 from ergast.com. You\ncan just go to the first web page here, then\nwe will navigate to the others from that.\nSo this is the general page. This is if you\njust type in without the .XML or .JSON or\nanything. So it's a table of information about\nraces in 1957. And we saw earlier that if\nyou add just add .XML to the end of this,\nit looks exactly the same. That's because\nthis browser is displaying XML properly by\ndefault. But, if you were to right click on\nit, and go to view page source, you would\nget this instead, and you can see the structure.\nThis is still XML, and so everything has an\nopening tag and a closing tag and some extra\ninformation in there. But, if you type in\n.JSON what you really get is this jumbled\nmess. Now that's unfortunate because there\nis a lot of structure to this. So, what I\nam going to do is, I am actually going to\ncopy all of this data, then I'm going to go\nto a little web page; there's a lot of things\nyou can do here, and it's a cute phrase. It's\ncalled JSON Pretty Print. And that is, make\nit look structured so it's easier to read.\nI just paste that in there and hit Pretty\nPrint JSON, and now you can see hierarchical\nstructure of the data. The interesting thing\nis that the JSON tags only have tags at the\nbeginning. It says series in quotes, then\na colon, then it gives the piece of information\nin quotes, and a comma and it moves on to\nthe next one. And this is a lot more similar\nto the way data would be represented in something\nlike R or Python. It is also more compact.\nAgain, there are things you can do with XML\nbut this is one of the reasons that JSON is\nbecoming preferred as a data carrier for websites.\nAnd as you may have guessed, it's really easy\nto convert between the formats. It's easy\nto convert between XML, JSON, CSV, etc. You\ncan get a web page where you can paste a version\nin and you get the other version out. There\nare some differences, but for the vast majority\nof situations, they are just interchangeable.\nIn Sum: what did we get from this? Like XML,\nJSON is semi-structured data, where there\nare tags that say what the information is,\nbut you define the tags however you want.\nJSON is specifically designed for data interchange\nand because it reflects the structure of the\ndata in the programs, that makes it really\neasy. Also, because it's relatively compact\nJSON is replacing gradually XML on the web,\nas the container for data on web pages. If\nwe are going to talk about \"Coding and Data\nScience\" and the languages that are used,\nthen first and foremost is R. The reason for\nthat is, according to many standards, R is\nthe language of data and data science. For\nexample, take a look at this chart. This is\na ranking based on a survey of data mining\nexperts of the software they use in doing\ntheir work, and R is right there at the top.\nR is first, and in fact that's important because\nthere's Python which is usually taken hand\nin hand with R for Data Science. But R sees\n50% more use than Python does, at least in\nthis particular list. Now there's a few reasons\nfor that popularity. Number one, R is free\nand it's open source, both of which make things\nvery easy. Second, R is specially developed\nfor vector operations. That means it's able\nto go through an entire list of data without\nhaving to write ‘for' loops to go through.\nIf you've ever had to write ‘for' loops,\nyou know that would be kind of disastrous\nhaving to do that with data analysis. Next,\nR has a fabulous community behind it. It's\nvery easy to get help on things with R, you\nGoogle it, you're going to end up in a place\nwhere you're going to be able to find good\nexamples of what you need. And probably most\nimportantly, R is very capable. R has 7,000\npackages that add capabilities to R. Essentially,\nit can do anything. Now, when you are working\nwith R, you actually have a choice of interfaces.\nThat is, how you actually do the coding and\nhow you get your results. R comes with it's\nown IDE or Interactive Development Environment.\nYou can do that, or if you are on a Mac or\na Linux you can actually do R through the\nTerminal through the command line. If you've\ninstalled R, you just type R and it starts\nup. There is also a very popular development\nenvironment called RStudio.com, and that's\nactually the one I use and the one I will\nbe using for all my examples. But another\nnew competitor is Jupyter, which is very commonly\nused for Python; that's what I use for examples\nthere. It works in a browser window, even\nthough its locally installed. And RStudio\nand Jupyter there's pluses and minus to each\none of them and I'll mention them as we get\nto each one of them. But no matter which interface\nyou use, R's command line, you're typing lines\nof code in order to get the commands. Some\npeople get really scared about that but really\nthere are some advantages to that in terms\nof the replicability and really the accessibility,\nthe transparency of your commands. So for\ninstance, here's a short example of some of\nthe commands in R. You can enter them into\nwhat is called a console, and that's just\none line at a time and that's called an interactive\nway. Or you can save scripts and run bits\nand pieces selectively and that makes your\nlife a lot easier. No matter how you do it,\nif you are familiar with programming other\nlanguages then you're going to find that R's\na little weird. It has an idiosyncratic model.\nIt makes sense once you get used to it, but\nit is a different approach, and so it takes\nsome adaptation if you are accustomed to programming\nin different languages. Now, once you do your\nprogramming to get your output, what you're\ngoing to get is graphs in a separate window.\nYou're going to get text and numbers, numerical\noutput in the console, and no matter what\nyou get, you can save the output to files.\nSo that makes it portable, you can do it in\nother environments. But most importantly,\nI like to think of this: here's our box of\nchocolates where you never know what you're\ngoing to get. The beauty of R is in the packages\nthat are available to expand its capabilities.\nNow there are two sources of packages for\nR. One goes by the name of CRAN, and that\nstands for the Comprehensive R Archive Network,\nand that's at cran.rstudio.com. And what that\ndoes is takes the 7,000 different packages\nthat are available and organizes them into\ntopics that they call task views. And for\neach one if they have done their homework,\nthey have datasets that come along with the\npackage. You have a manual in .pdf format,\nand you can even have vignettes where they\nrun through examples of how to do it. Another\ninterface is called Crantastic! And the exclamation\npoint is part of the title. And that is at\ncrantastic.org. And what this is, is an alternative\ninterface that links to CRAN. So if you find\nsomething you like in Crantastic! and you\nclick on the link, it's going to open in CRAN.\nBut the nice thing about Crantastic! is it\nshows the popularity of packages, and it also\nshows how recently they were updated, and\nthat can be a nice way of knowing you're getting\nsort of the latest and greatest. Now from\nthis very abstract presentation, we can say\na few things about R: Number one, according\nto many, R is the language of data science\nand it's a command line interface. You're\ntyping lines of code, so that gives it both\na strength and a challenge for some people.\nBut the beautiful thing is that for the thousands\nand thousands of packages of additional code\nand capability that are available for R, that\nmake it possible to do nearly anything in\nthis statistical programming language. When,\ntalking about \"Coding and Data Science\" and\nthe languages, along with R, we need to talk\nabout Python. Now, Python the snakes is a\ngeneral-purpose program that can do it all,\nand that's its beauty. If we go back to the\nsurvey of the software used by data mining\nexperts, you see that Python's there and it's\nnumber three on the list. What's significant\nabout that, is that on this list, Python is\nthe only general purpose programming language.\nIt's the only one that can be theoretically\nused to develop any kind of application that\nyou want. That gives it some special powers\ncompared to all the others, most of which\nare very specific to data science work. The\nnice things about Python are: number one,\nit's general purpose. It's also really easy\nto use, and if you have a Macintosh or Linux\ncomputer, Python is built into it. Also, Python\nhas a fabulous community around it with hundreds\nof thousands of people involved, and also\npython has thousands of packages. Now, it\nactually has 70 or 80,000 packages, but in\nterms of ones that are for data, there are\nstill thousands available that give it some\nincredible capabilities. A couple of things\nto know about Python. First, is about versions.\nThere are two versions of Python that are\nin wide circulation: there's 2.x; so that\nmeans like 2.5 or 2.6, and 3.x; so 3.1, 3.2.\nVersion 2 and version 3 are similar, but they\nare not identical. In fact, the problem is\nthis: there are some compatibility issues\nwhere code that runs in one does not run in\nthe other. And consequently, most people have\nto choose between one and the other. And what\nthis leads to is that many people still use\n2.x. I have to admit, in the examples that\nI use, I'm using 2.x because so many of the\ndata science packages that are developed with\nthat in mind. Now let me say a few things\nabout the interfaces for Python. First, Python\ndoes come with its own Interactive Development\nLearning Environment and they call it IDLE.\nYou can also run it from the Terminal, or\ncommand line interface, or any IDE that you\nhave. A very common and a very good choice\nis Jupyter. Jupyter is a browser-based framework\nfor programming and it was originally called\nIPython. That served as its initial, so a\nlot of the time when people are talking about\nIPython, what they are really talking about\nis this Python in Jupyter and the two are\nsometimes used interchangeably. One of the\nneat things you can do, there are two companies:\nContinuum and Enthought. Both of which have\nmade special distributions of Python with\nhundreds and hundreds of packages preconfigured\nto make it very easy to work with data. I\npersonally prefer Continuum Anaconda, it's\nthe one that I use, a lot of other people\nuse it, but either one is going to work and\nit's going to get you up and running. And\nlike I said with R, no matter what interface\nyou use, all of them are command line. You're\ntyping lines of code. Again, there is tremendous\nstrength to that but, it can be intimidating\nto some people at first. In terms of the actual\ncommands of Python, we have some examples\nhere on the side, and the important thing\nto remember is that it's a text interface.\nOn the other hand, Python is familiar to millions\nof people because it is very often a first\nprogramming language people learn to do general\npurpose programming. And there are a lot of\nvery simple adaptations for data that make\nit very powerful for data science work. So,\nlet me say something else again: data science\nloves Jupyter, and Jupyter is the browser-based\nframework. It's a local installation, but\nyou access it through a web browser that makes\nit possible to really do some excellent work\nin data science. There's a few reasons for\nthis. When you're working in Jupyter you get\ntext output and you can use what's called\nMarkdown as a way of formatting documents.\nYou can get inline graphics for the graphics\nto show up directly beneath the code that\nyou did it. It's also really easy to organize,\npresent, and to share analyses that are done\nin Jupyter. Which makes it a strong contender\nfor your choices in how you do data science\nprogramming. Another one of the beautiful\nthings about Python, like R, is there are\nthousands of packages available. In Python,\nthere is one main repository; it goes by the\nname PyPI. Which is for the Python Package\nIndex. Right here it says there are over 80,000\npackages and 7 or 8,000 of those are for data-specific\npurposes. Some of the packages that you will\nget to be very familiar with are NumPy and\nSciPy, which are for scientific computing\nin general; Matplotlib and a development of\nit called Seaborn are for data visualization\nand graphics. Pandas is the main package for\nthe doing statistical analysis. And for machine\nlearning, almost nothing beats scikit-learn.\nAnd when I go through hands-on examples in\nPython, I will be using all of these as a\nway of demonstrating the power of the program\nfor working with data. In sum we can say a\nfew things: Python is a very popular program\nvery familiar to millions of people and that\nmakes it a good choice. Second, of all the\nlanguages we use for data science on a frequent\nbasis, this is the only one that's general\npurpose. Which means it can be used for a\nlot of things other than processing data.\nAnd it gets its power, like R does, from having\nthousands of contributed packages which greatly\nexpand its capabilities especially in terms\nof doing data science work. A choice for \"Coding\nin Data Science,\" one of the languages that\nmay not come immediately to mind when they\nthink data science, is Sequel or SQL. SQL\nis the language of databases and we think,\n\"why do we want to work in SQL?\" Well, to\nparaphrase the famous bank robber Willie Sudden\nwho apparently explained why he robbed banks\nand said: \"Because that's where the money\nis.\" The reason we would with SQL in data\nscience is because that's where the data is.\nLet's take another look at our ranking of\nsoftware among data mining professionals,\nand there's SQL. Third on the list, and also\nof this list, its also the first database\ntool. Other tools, for instance, get much\nfancier, and much new and shinier, but SQL\nhas been around for a while as very very capable.\nThere's a few things to know about SQL. You\nwill notice that I am saying Sequel even though\nit stands for Structured Query Language. SQL\nis a language, not an application. There's\nnot a program SQL, it's a language that can\nbe used in different applications. Primarily,\nSQL is designed for what are called relational\ndatabases. And those are special ways of storing\nstructured data that you can pull in. You\ncan put things together, you can join them\nin special ways, you can get summary statistics,\nand then what you usually do is then export\nthat data into your analytical application\nof choice. The big word here is RDBMS - Relational\nDatabase Management System; that is where\nyou will usually see SQL as a query language\nbeing used. In terms of Relational Database\nManagement System, there are a few very common\nchoices. In the industrial world where people\nhave some money to spend, there's Oracle database\nis a very common one and Microsoft SQL Server.\nIn the open source world, two very common\nchoices are MySQL, even though we generally\nsay Sequel, when it's here you generally say\nMySQL. Another one is PostgreSQL. These are\nboth open source, free versions of the language;\nsort of dialects of each, that make it possible\nfor you to working with your databases and\nfor you to get your information out. The neat\nthing about them, no matter what you do, databases\nminimize data redundancy by using connected\ntables. Each table has rows and columns and\nthey store different levels or different of\nabstraction or measurement, which means you\nonly have to put the information one place\nand then it can refer to lots of other tables.\nMakes it very easy to keep things organized\nand up to date. When you are looking into\na way of working with a Relational Database\nManagement System, you get to choose in part\nbetween using a graphical user interface or\nGUI. Some of those include SQL Developer and\nSQL Server Management Studio, two very common\nchoices. And there are a lot of other choices\nsuch as Toad and some other choices that are\ngraphical interfaces for working with these\ndatabases. There are also text-based interfaces.\nSo really, any command line interface, and\nany interactive development environment or\nprogramming tool is going to be able to do\nthat. Now, you can think of yourself on the\ncommand deck of your ship and think of a few\nbasic commands that are very important for\nworking with SQL. There are just a handful\nof commands that can get you where you need\nto go. There is the Select command, where\nyou're choosing the cases that you want to\ninclude. From: says what tables are you going\nto be extracting them from. Where: is a way\nof specifying conditions, and then Order By:\nobviously is just a way of putting it all\ntogether. This works because usually when\nyou are in a SQL database you're just pulling\nout the information. You want to select it,\nyou want to organize it, and then what you\nare going to do is you are going to send the\ndata to your program of choice for further\nanalysis, like R or Python or whatever. In\nsum here's what we can say about SQL: Number\none, as a language it's generally associated\nwith relational databases, which are very\nefficient and well-structured ways of storing\ndata. Just a handful of basic commands can\nbe very useful when working with databases.\nYou don't have have to be a super ninja expert,\nreally a handful. Five, 10 commands will probably\nget you everything you need out of a SQL database.\nThen once the data is organized, the data\nis typically exported to some other program\nfor analysis. When you talk about coding in\nany field, one of the languages or one of\nthe groups of languages that come up most\noften are C, C++, and Java. These are extremely\npowerful applications and very frequently\nused for professional, production level coding.\nIn data science, the place where you will\nsee these languages most often is in the bedrock.\nThe absolute fundamental layer that makes\nthe rest of data science possible. For instance,\nC and C++. C is from the ‘60s, C++ is from\nthe ‘80s, and they have extraordinary wide\nusage, and their major advantage is that they're\nreally really fast. In fact, C is usually\nused as the benchmark for how fast is a language.\nThey are also very, very stable, which makes\nthem really well suited to production-level\ncode and, for instance, server use. What's\nreally neat is that in certain situations,\nif time is really important, if speeds important,\nthen you can actually use C code in R or other\nstatistical languages. Next is Java. Java\nis based on C++, it's major contribution was\nthe WORA or the Write Once Run Anywhere. The\nidea that you were going to be able to develop\ncode that is portable to different machines\nand different environments. Because of that,\nJava is the most popular computer programming\nlanguage overall against all tech situations.\nThe place you would use these in data science,\nlike I said, when time is of the essence,\nwhen something has to be fast, it has to get\nthe job accomplished quickly, and it has to\nnot break. Then these are the ones you're\nprobably going to use. The people who are\ngoing to use it are primarily going to be\nengineers. The engineers and the software\ndevelopers who deal with the inner workings\nof the algorithms in data science or the back\nend of data science. The servers and the mainframes\nand the entire structure that makes analysis\npossible. In terms of analysts, people who\nare actually analyzing the data, typically\ndon't do hands-on work with the foundational\nelements. They don't usually touch C or C++,\nmore of the work is on the front end or closer\nto the high-level languages like R or Python.\nIn sum: C, C++ and Java form a foundational\nbedrock in the back end of data and data science.\nThey do this because they are very fast and\nthey are very reliable. On the other hand,\ngiven their nature that work is typically\nreserved for the engineers who are working\nwith the equipment that runs in the back that\nmakes the rest of the analysis possible. I\nwant to finish our extremely brief discussion\nof \"Coding in Data Sciences\" and the languages\nthat can be used, by mentioning one other\nthat's called Bash. Bash really is a great\nexample of old tools that have survived and\nare still being used actively and productively\nwith new data. You can think of it this way,\nit's almost like typing on your typewriter.\nYou're working at the command line, you're\ntyping out code through a command line interface\nor a CLI. This method of interacting with\ncomputers practically goes back to the typewriter\nphase, because it predates monitors. So, before\nyou even had a monitor, you would type out\nthe code and it would print it out on a piece\nof paper. The important thing to know about\nthe command line is it's simply a method of\ninteracting. It's not a language, because\nlots of languages can run at the command line.\nFor instance, it is important to talk about\nthe concept of a shell. In computer science,\na shell is a language or something that wraps\naround the computer. It's a shell around the\nlanguage, that is the interaction level for\nthe user to get things done at the lower level\nthat aren't really human-friendly. On Mac\ncomputers and Linux, the most common is Bash,\nwhich is short for Bourne Again Shell. On\nWindows computers, the most common is PowerShell.\nBut whatever you do there actually are a lot\nof choices, there's the Bourne Shell, the\nC shell; which is why I have a seashell right\nhere, the Z shell, there's fish for Friendly\nInteractive Shell, and a whole bunch of other\nchoices. Bash is the most common on Mac and\nLinux and PowerShell is the most common on\nWindows as a method of interacting with the\ncomputer at the command line level. There's\na few things you need to know about this.\nYou have a prompt of some kind, in Bash, it's\na dollar sign, and that just means type your\ncommand here. Then, the other thing is you\ntype one line at a time. It's actually amazing\nhow much you can get done with a one-liner\nprogram, by sort of piping things together,\nso one feeds into the other. You can run more\ncomplex commands if you use a script. So,\nyou call a text document that has a bunch\nof things in it and you can get much more\nelaborate analyses done. Now, we have our\ntools here. In Bash we talk about utilities\nand what these are, are specific programs\nthat accomplish specific tools. Bash really\nthrives on \"Do one thing, and do it very well.\"\nThere are two general categories of utilities\nfor Bash. Number one, is the Built-ins. These\nare the ones that come installed with it,\nand so you're able to use it anytime by simply\ncalling in their name. Some more common ones\nare: cat, which is for catenate; that's to\nput information together. There's awk, which\nis it's own interpreted language, but it's\noften used for text processing from the command\nline. By the way, the name 'Awk' comes from\nthe initials of the people who created it.\nThen there's grep, which is for Global search\nwith a Regular Expression and Print. It's\na way of searching for information. And then\nthere's sed, which stands for Stream Editor\nand its main use is to transform text. You\ncan do an enormous amount with just these\n4 utilities. A few more are head & tail, display\nthe first or last 10 lines of a document.\nSort & uniq, which sort and count the number\nof unique answers in a document. Wc, which\nis for word count, and printf which formats\nthe output that you get in your console. And\nwhile you can get a huge amount of work done\nwith just this small number of built-in utilities,\nthere are also a wide range of installable.\nOr, other command line utilities that you\ncan add to Bash, or whatever programming language\nyou're using. So, since some really good ones\nthat have been recently developed are jq:\nwhich is for pulling in JSON or JavaScript,\nobject notation data from the web. And then\nthere's json2csv, which is a way of converting\nJSON to csv format, which is what a lot of\nstatistical programs are going to be happy\nwith. There's Rio which allows you to run\na wide range of commands from the statistical\nprogramming language R in the command line\nas part of Bash. And then there's BigMLer.\nThis is a command line tool that allows you\nto access BigML's machine learning servers\nthrough the command line. Normally, you do\nit through a web browser and it accesses their\nservers remote. It's an amazingly useful program\nbut to be able to just pull it up when you're\nin the command line is an enormous benefit.\nWhat's interesting is that even though you\nhave all these opportunities, all these different\nutilities, you can do all amazing things.\nAnd there's still an active element of utilities\nfor the command line. So, in sum: despite\nbeing in one sense as old as the dinosaurs,\nthe command line survives because it is extremely\nwell evolved and well suited to its purpose\nof working with data. The utilities; both\nthe built-in and the installable are fast\nand they are easy. In general, they do one\nthing and they do it very, very well. And\nthen surprisingly, there is an enormous amount\nof very active development of command line\nutilities for these purposes, especially with\ndata science. One critical task when you are\nCoding in Data Science is to be able to find\nthe things that you are looking for, and Regex\n(which is short of Regular Expressions) is\na wonderful way to do that. You can think\nof it as the supercharged method for finding\nneedles in haystacks. Now, Regex tends to\nlook a little cryptic so, for instance, here's\nan example. As something that's designed to\ndetermine if something is a valid email address,\nand it specifies what can go in the beginning,\nyou have the at sign in the middle, then you've\ngot a certain number of letters and numbers,\nthen you have to have a dot something at the\nend. And so, this is a special kind of code\nfor indicating what can go where. Now regular\nexpressions, or regex, are really a form of\npattern matching in text. And it's a way of\nspecifying what needs to be where, what can\nvary, and how much it can vary. And you can\nwrite both specific patterns; say I only want\na one letter variation here, or a very general\nlike the email validator that I showed you.\nAnd the idea here is that you can write this\nsearch pattern, your little wild card thing,\nyou can find the data and then once you identify\nthose cases, then you export them into another\nprogram for analysis. So here's a short example\nof how it can work. What I've done is taken\nsome text documents, they're actually the\ntexts to Emma and to Pygmalion, two books\nI got off of Project Gutenberg, and this is\nthe command. Grep ^l.ve *.txt - so what I'm\nlooking for in either of these books are lines\nthat start with ‘l', then they can have\none character; can be whatever, then that's\nfollowed by ‘ve', and then the .txt means\nsearch for all the text files in the particular\nfolder. And what it found were lines that\nbegan with love, and lived, and lovely, and\nso on. Now in terms of the actual nuts and\nbolts of regular expressions, there are some\ncertain elements. There are literals, and\nthose are things that are exactly what they\nmean. You type the letter ‘l', you're looking\nfor the letter ‘l'. There are also metacharacters,\nwhich specify, for instance, things need to\ngo here; they're characters but are really\ncode that give representations. Now, there\nare also escape sequences, which is normally\nthis character is used as a variable, but\nI want to really look for a period as opposed\nto a placeholder. Then you have the entire\nsearch expression that you create and you\nhave the target string, the thing that it\nis searching through. So let me give you a\nfew very short examples. ^ this is the caret.\nThis is the sometimes called a hat or in French,\na circonflexe. What that means, you're looking\nfor something at the beginning of the search\nyou are searching. For example, you can have\n^ and capital M, that means you need something\nthat begins with capital M. For instance the\nword \"Mac,\" true, it will find that. But if\nyou have iMac, it's a capital M, but it's\nnot the first letter and so that would be\nfalse, it won't find that. The $ means you\nare looking for something at the end of the\nstring. So for example: ing$ that will find\nthe word ‘fling' because it ends in ‘ing',\nbut it won't find the word ‘flings' because\nit actually ends with an ‘s'. And then the\ndot, the period, simply means that we are\nlooking for one letter and it can be anything.\nSo, for example, you can write ‘at.'. And\nthat will find ‘data' because it has an\n‘a', a ‘t', and then one letter after\nit. But it won't find ‘flat', because ‘flat'\ndoesn't have anything after the ‘at'. And\nso these are extremely simple examples of\nhow it can work. Obviously, it gets more complicated\nand the real power comes when you start combining\nthese bits and elements. Now, one interesting\nthing about this is you can actually treat\nthis as a game. I love this website, it's\ncalled Regex golf and it's at regex.alf.nu.\nAnd what it does is brings up lists of words;\ntwo columns, and your job is to write a regular\nexpression in the top, that matches all the\nwords on the left column and none of the words\non the right. And uses the fewest characters\npossible, and you get a score! And it's a\ngreat way of learning how to do regular expressions\nand learning how to search in a way that is\ngoing to get you the data you need for your\nprojects. So, in sum: Regex, or regular expressions,\nhelp you find the right data for your project,\nthey're very powerful and they're very flexible.\nNow, on the other hand, they are cryptic,\nat least when you first look at them but at\nthe same time, it's like a puzzle and it can\nbe a lot of fun if you practice it and you\nsee how you can find what you need. I want\nto thank you for joining me in \"Coding in\nData Science\" and we'll wrap up this course\nby talking about some of the specific next\nsteps you can take for working in data science.\nThe idea here, is that you want to get some\ntools and you want to start working with those\ntools. Now, please keep in mind something\nthat I've said at another time. Data tools\nand data science are related, they're important\nbut don't make the mistake of thinking that\nif you know the tools that you have done the\nsame thing as actually conducted data science.\nThat's not true, people sometimes get a little\nenthusiastic and they get a little carried\naway. What you need to remember is the relationship\nreally is this: Data Tools are an important\npart of data science, but data science itself\nis much bigger than just the tools. Now, speaking\nof tools remember there's a few kinds that\nyou can use, and that you might want to get\nsome experience with these. #1, in terms of\njust Apps, specific built applications Excel\n& Tableau are really fundamental for both\ngetting the data from clients or doing some\nbasic data browsing and Tableau is really\nwonderful for interactive data visualization.\nI strongly recommend you get very comfortable\nwith both of those. In terms of code, it's\na good idea to learn either ‘R' or ‘Python'\nor ideally to learn both. Ideally because\nyou can use them hand in hand. In terms of\nutilities, it's a great idea to work with\nBash, the command line utility and to use\nregular expression or regex. You can actually\nuse those in lots and lots of programs; regular\nexpressions. So they can have a very wide\napplication. And then finally, data science\nrequires some sort of domain expertise. You're\ngoing to need some sort of field experience\nor intimate understanding of a particular\ndomain and the challenges that come up and\nwhat constitutes workable answers and the\nkind of data that's available. Now, as you\ngo through all of this, you don't need to\nbuild this monstrous list of things. Remember,\nyou don't need everything. You don't need\nevery tool, you don't need every function,\nyou don't need every approach. Instead remember,\nget what's best for your needs, and for your\nstyle. But no matter what you do, remember\nthat tools are tools, they are a means to\nan end. Instead, you want to focus on the\ngoal of your data science project whatever\nit is. And I can tell you really, the goal\nis in the meaning, extracting meaning out\nof your data to make informed choices. In\nfact, I'll say a little more. The goal is\nalways meaning. And so with that, I strongly\nencourage you to get some tools, get started\nin data science and start finding meaning\nin the data that's around you. Welcome to\n\"Mathematics in Data Science\". I'm Barton\nPoulson and we're going to talk about how\nMathematics matters for data science. Now,\nyou maybe saying to yourself, \"Why math?\",\nand \"Computers can do it, I don't need to\ndo it\". And really fundamentally, \"I don't\nneed math I am just here to do my work\". Well,\nI am here to tell you, No. You need math.\nThat is if you want to be a data scientist,\nand I assume that you do. So we are going\nto talk about some of the basic elements of\nMathematics, really at a conceptual level\nand how they apply to data science. There\nare few ways that math really matters to data\nscience. #1, it allows you to know which procedures\nto use and why. So you can answer your questions\nin a way that is the most informative and\nthe most useful. #2, if you have a good understanding\nof math, then you know what to do when things\ndon't work right. That you get impossible\nvalues or things won't compute, and that makes\na huge difference. And then #3, an interesting\nthing is that some mathematical procedures\nare easier and quicker to do by hand then\nby actually firing up the computer. And so\nfor all 3 of these reasons, it's really helpful\nto have at least a grounding in Mathematics\nif you're going to do work in data science.\nNow probably the most important thing to start\nwith in Algebra. And there are 3 kinds of\nalgebra I want to mention. The first is elementary\nalgebra, that's the regular x+y. Then there\nis Linear or matrix algebra which looks more\ncomplex, but is conceptually it is used by\ncomputers to actually do the calculations.\nAnd then finally I am going to mention Systems\nof Linear Equations where you have multiple\nequations simultaneously that you're trying\nto solve. Now there's more math than just\nalgebra. A few other things I'm going to cover\nin this course. Calculus, a little bit of\nBig O or order which has to do with the speed\nand complexity of operations. A little bit\nof probability theory and a little bit of\nBayes or Bayes theorem which is used for getting\nposterior probabilities and changes the way\nyou interpret the results of an analysis.\nAnd for the purposes of this course, I'm going\nto demonstrate the procedures by hand, of\ncourse you would use software to do this in\nthe real world, but we are dealing with simple\nproblems at conceptual levels. And really,\nthe most important thing to remember is that\neven though a lot of people get put off by\nmath, really You can do it! And so, in sum:\nlet's say these three things about math. First\noff, you do need some math to do good data\nscience. It helps you diagnose problems, it\nhelps you choose the right procedures, and\ninterestingly you can do a lot of it by hand,\nor you can use software computers to do the\ncalculations as well. As we begin our discussion\nof the role of \"Mathematics and Data Science\",\nwe'll of course begin with the foundational\nelements. And in data science nothing is more\nfoundational than Elementary Algebra. Now,\nI'd like to begin this with really just a\nbit of history. In case you're not aware,\nthe first book on algebra was written in 820\nby Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi. And it\nwas called \"The Compendious Book on Calculation\nby Completion and Balancing\". Actually, it\nwas called this, which if you transliterate\nthat comes out to this, but look at this word\nright here. That's the algebra, which means\nRestoration. In any case, that's where it\ncomes from and for our concerns, there are\nseveral kinds of algebra that we're going\nto talk about. There's Elementary Algebra,\nthere's Linear Algebra and there are systems\nof linear equations. We'll talk about each\nof those in different videos. But to put it\ninto context, let's take an example here of\nsalaries. Now, this is based on real data\nfrom a survey of the salary of people employed\nin data science and to give a simple version\nof it. The salary was equal to a constant,\nthat's sort of an average value that everybody\nstarted with and to that you added years,\nthen some measure of bargaining skills and\nhow many hours they worked per week. And that\ngave you your prediction, but that wasn't\nexact there's also some error to throw into\nit to get to the precise value that each person\nhas. Now, if you want to abbreviate this,\nyou can write it kind of like this: S + C\n+ Y + B + H + E, although it's more common\nto write it symbolically like this, and let's\ngo through this equation very quickly. The\nfirst thing we have is outcome,; we call that\ny the variable y for person i, \"i\" stands\nfor each case in our observations. So, here's\noutcome y for person i. This letter here,\nis a Greek Beta and it represents the intercept\nor the average, that's why it has a zero,\nbecause we don't multiply it times anything.\nBut right next to it we have a coefficient\nfor variable 1. So Beta, which means a coefficient,\nsub 1 for the first variable and then we have\nvariable 1 then x 1, means variable 1, then\ni means its the score on that variable for\nperson i, whoever we are talking about. Then\nwe do the same thing for variables 2 and 3,\nand at the end, we have a little epsilon here\nwith an i for the error term for person i,\nwhich says how far off from the prediction\nwas their actual score. Now, I'm going to\nrun through some of these procedures and we'll\nsee how they can be applied to data science.\nBut for right now let's just say this in sum.\nFirst off, Algebra is vital to data science.\nIt allows you to combine multiple scores,\nget a single outcome, do a lot of other manipulations.\nAnd really, the calculations, their easy for\none case at at time. Especially when you're\ndoing it by hand. The next step for \"Mathematics\nfor Data Science\" foundations is to look at\nLinear algebra or an extension of elementary\nalgebra. And depending on your background,\nyou may know this by another name and I like\nto think welcome to the Matrix. Because it's\nalso known as matrix algebra because we are\ndealing with matrices . Now, let's go back\nto an example I gave in the last video about\nsalary. Where salary is equal to a constant\nplus years, plus bargaining, plus hours plus\nerror, okay that's a way to write it out in\nwords and if you want to put it in symbolic\nform, it's going to look like this. Now before\nwe get started with matrix algebra, we need\nto talk about a few new words, maybe you're\nfamiliar with them already. The first is Scalar,\nand this means a single number. And then a\nvector is a single row or a single column\nof numbers that can be treated as a collection.\nThat usually means a variable. And then finally,\na matrix consists of many rows and columns.\nSort of a big rectangle of numbers, the plural\nof that by the way is matrices and the thing\nto remember is that Machines love Matrices.\nNow let's take a look at a very simple example\nof this. Here is a very basic representation\nof matrix algebra or Linear Algebra. Where\nwe are showing data on two people, on four\nvariables. So over here on the left, we have\nthe outcomes for cases 1 and 2, our people\n1 and 2. And we put it into the square brackets\nto indicate that it's a vector or a matrix.\nHere on the far left, it's a vector because\nit's a single column of values. Next to that\nis a matrix, that has here on the top, the\nscores for case 1, which I've written as x's.\nX1 is for variable 1, X2 is for variable 2\nand the second subscript is indicated that\nit's for person 1. Below that, are the scores\nfor case 2, the second person. And then over\nhere, in another vertical column are the regression\ncoefficients, that's a beta there that we\nare using. And then finally, we've got a tiny\nlittle vector here which contains the error\nterms for cases 1 and 2. Now, even though\nyou would not do this by hand, it's helpful\nto run through the procedure, so I'm going\nto show it to you by hand. And we are going\nto take two fictional people. This will be\nfictional person #1, we'll call her Sophie.\nWe'll say that she's 28 years old and we'll\nsay that she's has good bargaining skills,\na 4 on a scale of 5, and that she works 50\nhours a week and that her salary is $118,000.00.\nOur second fictional person, we'll call him\nLars and we'll say that he's 34 years old\nand he has moderate bargaining skills 3 out\nof 5, works 35 hours per week and has a salary\nof $84,000.00. And so if we are trying to\nlook at salaries, we can look at our matrix\nrepresentation that we had here, with our\nvariables indicated with their Latin and sometimes\nGreek symbols. And we will replace those variables\nwith actual numbers. We have the salary for\nSophie, our first person. So why don't we\nplug in the numbers here and let's start with\nthe result here. Sophie's salary is $118,000.00\nand here's how all these numbers all add up\nto get that. The first thing here is the intercept.\nAnd we just multiply that times 1, so that's\nsort of the starting point, and then we get\nthis number 10, which actually has to do with\nyears over 18. She's 28 so that's 10 years\nover 18, we multiply each year by 1395. Next\nis bargaining skills. She's got a 4 out of\n5 and for each step up you get $5,900.00.\nBy the way, these are real coefficients from\nstudy of survey of salary of data scientists.\nAnd then finally hours per week. For each\nhour, you get $382.00. Now you can add these\nup, and get a predicted value for her but\nit's a little low. It's $30,00.00 low. Which\nyou may be saying that's pretty messed up,\nwell that's because there's like 40 variables\nin the equation including she might be the\nowner and if she's the owner then yes she's\ngoing to make a lot more. And then we do a\nsimilar thing for the second case, but what's\nneat about matrix algebra or Linear Algebra\nis this means the same stuff and what we have\nhere are these bolded variables. That stand\nin for entire vectors or matrices. So for\ninstance; this Y, a bold Y stands for the\nvector of outcome scores. This bolded X is\nthe entire matrix of values that each person\nhas on each variable. This bolded beta is\nall of the regression coefficients and then\nthis bolded epsilon is the entire vector of\nerror terms. And so it's a really super compact\nway of representing the entire collection\nof data and coefficients that you use in predicting\nvalues. So in sum, let's say this. First off,\ncomputers use matrices. They like to do linear\nalgebra to solve problems and is conceptually\nsimpler because you can put it all in there\nin this type formation. In fact, it's a very\ncompact notation and it allows you to manipulate\nentire collections of numbers pretty easily.\nAnd that's that major benefit of learning\na little bit about linear or matrix algebra.\nOur next step in \"Mathematics for Data Science\nFoundations\" is systems of linear equations.\nAnd maybe you are familiar with this, but\nmaybe you're not. And the idea here is that\nthere are times, when you actually have many\nunknowns and you're trying to solve for them\nall simultaneously. And what makes this really\ntricky is that a lot of these are interlocked.\nSpecifically that means X depends on Y, but\nat the same time Y depends on X. What's funny\nabout this, is it's actually pretty easy to\nsolve these by hand and you can also use linear\nmatrix algebra to do it. So let's take a little\nexample here of Sales. Let's imagine that\nyou have a company and that you've sold 1,000\niPhone cases, so that they are not running\naround naked like they are in this picture\nhere. Some of them sold for $20 and others\nsold for $5. You made a total of $5,900.00\nand so the question is \"How many were sold\nat each price?\" Now, if you were keeping our\nrecords, but you can also calculate it from\nthis little bit of information. And to show\nyou I'm going to do it by hand. Now, we're\ngoing to start with this. We know that sales\nthe two price points x + y add up to 1,000\ntotal cases sold. And for revenue, we know\nthat if you multiply a certain number times\n$20 and another number times $5, that it all\nadds up to $5,900.00. Between the two of those\nwe can figure out the rest. Let's start with\nsales. Now, what I'm going to do is try to\nisolate the values. I am going to do that\nby putting in this minus y on both sides and\nthen I can take that and I can subtract it,\nso I'm left with x is equal to 1,000 - y.\nNormally I solve for x, but I solve for y,\nyou'll see why in just a second. Then we go\nto revenue. We know from earlier that our\nsales at these two prices points, add up to\n$5,900.00 total. Now what we are going to\ndo is take the x that's right here and we\nare going to replace it with the equation\nwe just got, which is 1,000 - y. Then we multiply\nthat through and we get $20,000.00 minus $20y\nplus $5 y equals $5,900.00. Well, we can subtract\nthese two because they are on the same thing.\nSo, $20y then we get $15y, and then we subtract\n$20,000.00 from both sides. So there it is,\nright there on the left, and that disappears,\nthen I get it over on the right side. And\nthen I do the math there, and I get minus\n$14, 100.00. Well, then I divide both sides\nby negative $15.00 and when we do that we\nget y equals 940. Okay, so that's one of our\nvalues for sales. Let's go back to sales.\nWe have x plus y equals 1,000. We take the\nvalue we just got, 940, we stick that into\nthe equation, then we can solve for x. Just\nsubtract 940 from each side, there we go.\nWe get x is equal to 60. So, let's put it\nall together, just to recap what happened.\nWhat this tells us is that 60 cases were sold\nat $20.00 each. And that 940 cases were sold\nat $5 each. Now, what's interesting about\nthis is you can also do this graphically.\nWe're going to draw it. So, I'm going to graph\nthe two equations. Here are the original ones\nwe had. This one predicts sales, this one\ngives price. The problem is, these aren't\nin the economical form for creating graphs.\nThat needs to be y equals something else,\nso we're going to solve both of these for\ny. We subtract x from both sides, there it\nis on the left, we subtract that. Then we\nhave y is equals to minus x plus 1,000. That's\nsomething we can graph. Then we do the same\nthing for price. Let's divide by 5 all the\nway through, that gets rid of that and then\nwe've got this 4x, then let's subtract 4x\nfrom each side. And what we are left with\nis minus 4x plus 1,180, which is also something\nwe can graph. So this first line, this indicates\ncases sold. It originally said x plus y equals\n1000, but we rearranged it to y is equal to\nminus x plus 1000. And so that's the line\nwe have here. And then we have another line,\nwhich indicates earnings. And this one was\noriginally written as $20.00 times x plus\n$5.00 times y equals $5,900.00 total. We rearranged\nthat to y equals minus 4x plus 1,180. That's\nthe equation for the line and then the solution\nis right here at the intersection. There's\nour intersection and it's at 60 on the number\nof cases sold at $20.00 and 940 as the number\nof cases sold at $5.00 and that also represents\nthe solution of the joint equations. It's\na graphical way of solving a system of linear\nequations. So in sum, systems of linear equations\nallow us to balance several unknowns and find\nunique solutions. And in many cases, it's\neasy to solve by hand, and it's really easy\nwith linear algebra when you use software\nto do it at the same time. As we continue\nour discussion of \"Mathematics for Data Science\"\nand the foundational principles the next thing\nwe want to talk about is Calculus. And I'm\ngoing to give a little more history right\nhere. The reason I'm showing you pictures\nof stones, is because the word Calculus is\nLatin for stone, as in a stone used for tallying.\nWhere when people would actually have a bag\nof stones and they would use it to count sheep\nor whatever. And the system of Calculus was\nformalized in the 1,600s simultaneously, independently\nby Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.\nAnd there are 3 reasons why Calculus is important\nfor data science. #1, it's the basis for most\nof the procedures we do. Things like least\nsquares regression and probability distributions,\nthey use Calculus in getting those answers.\nSecond one is if you are studying anything\nthat changes over time. If you are measuring\nquantities or rates that change over time\nthen you have to use Calculus. Calculus is\nused in finding the maxima and minima of functions\nespecially when you're optimizing. Which is\nsomething I'm going to show you separately.\nAlso, it is important to keep in mind, there\nare two kinds of Calculus. The first is differential\nCalculus, which talks about rates of change\nat a specific time. It's also known as the\nCalculus of change. The second kind of Calculus\nis Integral Calculus and this is where you\nare trying to calculate the quantity of something\nat a specific time, given the rate of change.\nIt's also known as the Calculus of Accumulation.\nSo, let's take a look at how this works and\nwe're going to focus on differential Calculus.\nSo I'm going to graph an equation here, I'm\ngoing to do y equals x2 a very simple one\nbut it's a curve which makes it harder to\ncalculate things like the slope. Let's take\na point here that's at minus 2, that's the\nmiddle of the red dot. X is equal to minus\n2. And because y is equal to x2 , if we want\nto get the y value, all we got to do is take\nthat negative 2 and square it and that gives\nus 4. So that's pretty easy. So the coordinates\nfor that red point are minus 2 on x, and plus\n4 on the y. Here's a harder question. \"What\nis the slope of the curve at that exact point?\"\nWell, it's actually a little tricky because\nthe curve is always curving there's no flat\npart on it. But we can get the answer by getting\nthe derivative of the function. Now, there\nare several different ways of writing this,\nI am using the one that's easiest to type.\nAnd let's start by this, what we are going\nto do is the n here and that is the squared\npart, so that we have x2 . And you see that\nsame n turns into the squared, and then we\ncome over here and we put that same value\n2 in right there, and we put the two in right\nhere. And then we can do a little bit of subtraction.\n2 minus 1 is 1 and truthfully you can just\nignore that then then you get 2x. That is\nthe derivative, so what we have here is the\nderivative of x2 is 2x. That means, the slope\nat any given point in the curve is 2x. So,\nlet's go back to the curve we had a moment\nago. Here's our curve, here's our point at\nx minus 2, and so the slope is equal to 2x,\nwell we put in the minus 2, and we multiply\nit and we get minus 4. So that is the slope\nat this exact point in the curve. Okay, what\nif we choose a different point? Let's say\nwe came over here to x is equal to 3? Well,\nthe slope is equal to 2x so that's 2 times\n3, is equal to 6. Great! And on the other\nhand, you might be saying to yourself \"And\nwhy do I care about this?\" There's a reason\nthat this is important and what it is, is\nthat you can use these procedures to optimize\nthe decisions. And if that seems a little\nto abstract to you, that means you can use\nthem to make more money. And I'm going to\ndemonstrate that in the next video. But for\nright now in sum, let's say this. Calculus\nis vital to practical data science, it's the\nfoundation of statistics and it forms the\ncore that's needed for doing optimization.\nIn our discussion about Mathematics and data\nscience foundations, the last thing I want\nto talk about right here is calculus and how\nit relates to optimization. I like to think\nof this, in other words, as the place where\nmath meets reality, or it meets Manhattan\nor something. Now if you remember this graph\nI made in the last video, y is equal to x2,\nthat shows this curve here and we have the\nderivative that the slope can be given by\n2x. And so when x is equal to 3, the slope\nis equal to 6, fine. And this is where this\ncomes into play. Calculus makes it possible\nto find values that maximize or minimize outcomes.\nAnd if you want to think of something a little\nmore concrete here, let's think of an example,\nby the way that's Cupid and Psyche. Let's\ntalk about pricing for online dating. Let's\nassume you've created a dating service and\nyou want to figure out how much can you charge\nfor it that will maximize your revenue. So,\nlet's get a few hypothetical parameters involved.\nFirst off, let's say that subscriptions, annual\nsubscriptions cost $500.00 each year and you\ncan charge that for a dating service. And\nlet's say you sell 180 new subscriptions every\nweek. On the other hand, based on your previous\nexperience manipulating prices around, you\nhave some data that suggests that for each\n$5 you discount from the price of $500.00\nyou will get 3 more sales. Also, because its\nan online service, lets make our life a little\nmore easier right now and assume there is\nno increase in overhead. It's not really how\nit works, but we'll do it for now. And I'm\nactually going to show you how to do all this\nby hand. Now, let's go back to price first.\nWe have this. $500.00 is the current annual\nsubscription price and you're going to subtract\n$5.00 for each unit of discount, that's why\nI'm giving D. So, one discount is $5.00, two\ndiscounts is $10.00 and so on. And then we\nhave a little bit of data about sales, that\nyou're currently selling 180 subscriptions\nper week and that you will add 3 more for\neach unit of discount that you give. So, what\nwe're going to do here is we are going to\nfind sales as a function of price. Now, to\ndo that the first thing we have to do is get\nthe y intercept. So we have price here, is\n$500.00, is the current annual subscription\nprice minus $5 times d. And what we are going\nto do is, is we are going to get the y intercept\nby solving when does this equal zero? Okay,\nwell we take the $500 we subtract that from\nboth sides and then we end up with minus $5d\nis equal to minus $500.00. Divide both sides\nby minus $5 and we are left with d is equal\nto 100. That is, when d is equal to 100, x\nis 0. And that tells us how we can get the\ny intercept, but to get that we have to substitute\nthis value into sales. So we take d is equal\nto 100, and the intercept is equal to 180\nplus 3; 180 is the number of new subscriptions\nper week and then we take the three and we\nmultiply that times our 100. So, 180 times\n3 times 100,[1] is equal to 300 add those\ntogether and you get 480. And that is the\ny intercept in our equation, so when we've\ndiscounted sort of price to zero then the\nexpected sale is 480. Of course that's not\ngoing to happen in reality, but it's necessary\nfor finding the slope of the line. So now\nlet's get the slope. The slope is equal to\nthe change in y on the y axis divided by the\nchange in x. One way we can get this is by\nlooking at sales; we get our 180 new subscriptions\nper week plus 3 for each unit of discount\nand we take our information on price. $500.00\na year minus $5.00 for each unit of discount\nand then we take the 3d and the $5d and those\nwill give us the slope. So it's plus 3 divided\nby minus 5, and that's just minus 0.6. So\nthat is the slope of the line. Slope is equal\nto minus 0.6. And so what we have from this\nis sales as a function of price where sales\nis equal to 480 because that is the y intercept\nwhen price is equal to zero minus 0.6 times\nprice. So, this isn't the final thing. Now\nwhat we have to do, we turn this into revenue,\nthere's another stage to this. Revenue is\nequal to sales times price, how many things\ndid you sell and how much did it cost. Well,\nwe can substitute some information in here.\nIf we take sales and we put it in as a function\nof price, because we just calculated that\na moment ago, then we do a little bit of multiplication\nand then we get that revenue is equal to 480\ntimes the price minus 0.6 times the price.\nOkay, that's a lot of stuff going on there.\nWhat we're going to do now is we're going\nto get the derivative, that's the calculus\nthat we talked about. Well, the derivative\nof 480 and the price, where price is sort\nof the x, the derivative is simply 480 and\nthe minus 0.6 times price? Well, that's similar\nto what we did with the curve. And what we\nend up with is 0.6 times 2 is equal to 1.2\ntimes the price. This is the derivative of\nthe original equation. We can solve that for\nzero now, and just in case you are wondering.\nWhy do we solve it for zero? Because that\nis going to give us the place when y is at\na maximum. Now we had a minus squared so we\nhave to invert the shape. When we are trying\nto look for this value right here when it's\nat the very tippy top of the curve, because\nthat will indicate maximum revenue. Okay,\nso what we're going to do is solve for zero.\nLet's go back to our equation here. We want\nto find out when is that equal to zero? Well,\nwe subtract 480 from each side, there we go\nand we divide by minus 1.2 on each side. And\nthis is our price for maximum revenue. So\nwe've been charging $500.00 a week, but this\nsays we'll have more total income if we charge\n$400.00 instead. And if you want to find out\nhow many sales we can get, currently we have\n480 and if you want to know what the sales\nvolume is going to be for that. Well, you\ntake the 480 which is the hypothetical y intercept\nwhen the price is zero, but then we put in\nour actual price of $400.00, multiply that,\nwe get 240, do the subtraction and we get\n240 total. So, that would be 240 new subscriptions\nper week. So let's compare this. Current revenue,\nis 180 new subscriptions per week at $500.00\nper year. And that means our current revenue\nis $90,000.00 per year, I know it sounds really\ngood, but we can do better than that. Because\nthe formula for maximum value is 240 times\n$400.00, when you multiply those you get $96,000.00.\nAnd so the improvement is just a ratio of\nthose two. $96,000.00 divided by $90,000.00\nis equal to 1.07. And what that means is a\n7% increase and anybody would be thrilled\nto get a 7% increase in their business simply\nby changing the price and increasing the overall\nrevenue. So, let's summarize what we found\nhere. If you lower the cost by 20%, go from\n$500.00 year to $400.00 per year, assuming\nall of our other information is correct, then\nyou can increase sales by 33%; that's more\nthan the 20 that you had and that increases\ntotal revenue by 7%. And so we can optimize\nthe price to get the maximum total revenue\nand it has to do with that little bit of calculus\nand the derivative of the function. So in\nsum, calculus can be used to find the minima\nand maxima of functions including prices.\nIt allows for optimization and that in turn\nallows you to make better business decisions.\nOur next topic in \"Mathematics and Data Principals\",\nis something called Big O. And if you are\nwondering what Big O is all about, it is about\ntime. Or, you can think of it as how long\ndoes it take to do a particular operation.\nIt's the speed of the operation. If you want\nto be really precise, the growth rate of a\nfunction; how much more it requires as you\nadd elements is called its Order. That's why\nit's called Big O, that's for Order. And Big\nO gives the rate of how things grow as the\nnumber of elements grows, and what's funny\nis there can be really surprising differences.\nLet me show you how it works with a few different\nkinds of growth rates or Big O. First off,\nthere's the ones that I say are sort of one\nthe spot, you can get stuff done right away.\nThe simplest one is O1, and that is a constant\norder. That's something that takes the same\namount of time, no matter what. You can send\nan email out to 10,000 people just hit one\nbutton; it's done. The number of elements,\nthe number of people, the number of operations,\nit just takes the same amount of time. Up\nfrom that is Logarithmic, where you take the\nnumber of operations, you get the logarithm\nof that and you can see it's increased, but\nreally it's only a small increase, it tapers\noff really quickly. So an example is finding\nan item in a sorted rate. Not a big deal.\nNext, one up from that, now this looks like\na big change, but in the grand scheme, it's\nnot a big change. This is a linear function,\nwhere each operation takes the same unit of\ntime. So if you have 50 operations, you have\n50 units of time. If you're storing 50 objects\nit takes 50 units of space. So, find an item\nin an unsorted list it's usually going to\nbe linear time. Then we have the functions\nwhere I say you know, you'd better just pack\na lunch because it's going to take a while.\nThe best example of this is called Log Linear.\nYou take the number of items and you multiply\nthat number times the log of the items. An\nexample of this is called a fast Fourier transform,\nwhich is used for dealing for instance with\nsound or anything that sort of is over time.\nYou can see it takes a lot longer, if you\nhave 30 elements your way up there at the\ntop of this particular chart at 100 units\nof time, or 100 units of space or whatever\nyou want to put it. And it looks like a lot.\nBut really, that's nothing compared to the\nnext set where I say, you know you're just\ngoing to be camping out you may as well go\nhome. That includes something like the Quadratic.\nYou square the number of elements, you see\nhow that kind of just shoots straight up.\nThat's Quadratic growth. And so multiplying\ntwo n-digit numbers, if you're multiplying\ntwo numbers that have 10 digit numbers it's\ngoing to take you that long, it's going to\ntake a long time. Even more extreme is this\none, this is the exponential, two raised to\nthe power to the number of items you have.\nYou'll see, by the way, the red line does\nnot even go all the way to the top. That's\nbecause the graphing software that I'm using,\ndoesn't draw it when it goes above my upper\nlimit there, so it kind of cuts it off. But\nthis is a really demanding kind of thing,\nit's for instance finding an exact solution\nfor what's called the Travelling Salesman\nProblem, using dynamic programming. That's\nan example of exponential rate of growth.\nAnd then one more I want to mention which\nis sort of catastrophic is Factorial. You\ntake the number of elements and you raise\nthat to the exclamation point Factorial, and\nyou see that one cuts off very soon because\nit basically goes straight up. You have any\nnumber of elements of any size, it's going\nto be hugely demanding. And for instance if\nyou're familiar with the Travelling Salesman\nProblem, that's trying to find the solution\nthrough the brute force search, it takes a\nhuge amount of time. And you know before something\nlike that is done, you're probably going to\nturn to stone and wish you'd never even started.\nThe other thing to know about this, is that\nnot only do something's take longer than others,\nsome of these methods and some functions are\nmore variable than others. So for instance,\nif you're working with data that you want\nto sort, there are different kinds of sort\nor sorting methods. So for instance, there\nis something called an insertion sort. And\nwhen you find this on its best day, it's linear.\nIt's O of n, that's not bad. On the other\nhand the average is Quadratic and that's a\nhuge difference between the two. Selection\nsorts on the other hand, the best is quadratic\nand the average is quadratic. It's always\nconsistent, so it's kind of funny, it takes\na long time, but at least you know how long\nit's going to take versus the variability\nof something like an insertion sort. So in\nsum, let me say a few things about Big O.\n#1, You need to know that certain functions\nor procedures vary in speed, and the same\nthing applies to making demands on a computer's\nmemory or storage space or whatever. They\nvary in their demands. Also, some are inconsistent.\nSome are really efficient sometimes and really\nslow or difficult the others. Probably the\nmost important thing here is to be aware of\nthe demands of what you are doing. That you\ncan't, for instance, run through every single\npossible solution or you know, your company\nwill be dead before you get an answer. So\nbe mindful of that so you can use your time\nwell and get the insight you need, in the\ntime that you need it. A really important\nelement of the \"Mathematics and Data Science\"\nand one of its foundational principles is\nProbability. Now, one of the things that Probability\ncomes in intuitively for a lot of people is\nsomething like rolling dice or looking at\nsports outcomes. And really the fundamental\nquestion of what are the odds of something.\nThat gets at the heart of Probability. Now\nlet's take a look at some of the basic principles.\nWe've got our friend, Albert Einstein here\nto explain things. The Principles of Probability\nwork this way. Probabilities range from zero\nto 1, that's like zero percent to one hundred\npercent chance. When you put P, then in parenthesis\nhere A, that means the Probability of whatever\nis in parenthesis. So P(A), means the Probability\nof A. and then P(B) is the Probability of\nB. When you take all of the probabilities\ntogether, you get what is called the probability\nSpace. And that's why we have S and that all\nadds up to 1, because you've now covered 100\n% of the possibilities. Also you can talk\nabout the compliment. The tilde here is used\nto say the probability of not A is equal to\n1 minus the probability of A, because those\nhave to add up. So, let's take a look at something\nalso that conditional probabilities, which\nis really important in statistics. A conditional\nprobability is the probability that something\nif something else is true. You write it this\nway: the probability of, and that vertical\nline is called a Pipe and it's read as assuming\nthat or given that. So you can read this as\nthe probability of A given B, is the probability\nof A occurring if B is true. So you can say\nfor instance, what's the probability if something's\norange, what's the probability that it's a\ncaret given this picture. Now, the place that\nthis comes in really important for a lot of\npeople is the probability of type one and\ntype two errors in hypothesis testing, which\nwe'll mention at some other point. But I do\nwant to say something about arithmetic with\nprobabilities because it does not always work\nout the way people think it will. Let's start\nby talking about adding probabilities. Let's\nsay you have two events A and B, and let's\nsay you want to find the probabilities of\neither one of those events. So that's like\nadding the probabilities of the two events.\nWell, it's kind of easy. You take the probability\nof event A and you add the probability of\nevent B, however you may have to subtract\nsomething, you may have to subtract this little\npiece because maybe there are some overlap\nbetween the two of them. On the other hand\nif A and B are disjoined, meaning they never\noccur together, then that's equal to zero.\nAnd then you can subtract zero which is just,\nyou get back to the original probabilities.\nLet's take a really easy example of this.\nI've created my super simple sample space\nI have 10 shapes. I have 5 squares on top,\n5 circles on the bottom and I've got a couple\nof red shapes on the right side. Let's say\nwe want to find the probability of a square\nor a red shape. So we are adding the probabilities\nbut we have to adjust for the overlap between\nthe two. Well here's our squares on top. 5\nout of the 10 are squares and over here on\nthe right we have two red shapes, two out\nof 10. Let's go back to our formula here and\nlet's change a little bit. Change the A and\nthe B to S and R for square and red. Now we\ncan start this way, let's get the probability\nthat something is a square. Well, we go back\nto our probability space and you see we have\n5 squares out of 10 shapes total. So we do\n5 over 10, that reduces to .5. Okay, next\nup the probability of something red in our\nsample space. Well, we have 10 shapes total,\ntwo of them on the far right are red. That's\ntwo over 10, and you do the division get.2.\nNow, the trick is the overlap between these\ntwo categories, do we have anything that is\nboth square and red, because we don't want\nto count that twice we have to subtract it.\nLet's go back to our sample space and we are\nlooking for something that is square, there's\nthe squares on top and there's the things\nthat are red on the side. And you see they\noverlap and this is our little overlapping\nsquare. So there's one shape that meets both\nof those, one out of 10. So we come back here,\none out of 10, that reduces to .1 and then\nwe just do the addition and subtraction here.\n.5 plus .2 minus .1, gets us .6. And so what\nthat means is, there is a 60% chance of an\nobject being square or red. And you can look\nat it right here. We have 6 shapes outlined\nnow and so that's the visual interpretation\nthat lines up with the mathematical one we\njust did. Now let's talk about multiplication\nfor Probabilities. Now the idea here is you\nwant to get joint probabilities, so the probability\nof two things occurring together, simultaneously.\nAnd what you need to do here, is you need\nto multiply the probabilities. And we can\nsay the probability of A and B, because we\nare asking about A and B occurring together,\na joint occurrence. And that's equal to the\nprobability of A times the probability of\nB, that's easy. But you do have to expand\nit just a little bit because you can have\nthe problem of things overlapping a little\nbit, and so you actually need to expand it\nto a conditional probability, the probability\nof B given A. Again, that's that vertical\npipe there. On the other hand, if A and B\nare independent and they never co-occur, or\nB is no more likely to occur if A happens,\nthen it just reduces to the probability of\nB, then you get your slightly simpler equation.\nBut let's go and take a look at our sample\nspace here. So we've got our 10 shapes, 5\nof each kind, and then two that are red. And\nwe are going to look at originally, the probability\nof something being square or red, now we are\ngoing to look at the probability of it being\nsquare and red. Now, I know we can eyeball\nthis one real easy, but let's run through\nthe math. The first thing we need to do, is\nget the ones that are square. There's those\n5 on the top and the ones that are red, and\nthere's those two on the right. In terms of\nthe ones that are both square and red, yes\nobviously there's just this one red square\nat the top right. But let's do the numbers\nhere. We change our formula to be S and R\nfor square and red, we get the probability\nof square. Again that's those 5 out of 10,\nso we do 5/10, reduce this to .5. And then\nwe need the probability of red given that\nit's a square. So, we only need to look at\nthe squares here. There's the squares, 5 of\nthem, and one of them is red. So that's 1\nover 5 . That reduces to .2. You multiply\nthose two numbers; .5 times .2, and what you\nget is .10 or 10% chance or 10 percent of\nour total sample space is red squares. And\nyou come back and you look at it and you say\nyeah there's one out of 10. So, that just\nconfirms what we are able to do intuitively.\nSo, that's our short presentation on probabilities\nand in sum what did we get out of that? #1,\nProbability is not always intuitive. And also\nthe idea that conditional values can help\nin a lot of situations, but they may not work\nthe way you expect them to. And really the\narithmetic of Probability can surprise people\nso pay attention when you are working with\nit so you can get a more accurate conclusion\nin your own calculations. Let's finish our\ndiscussion of \"Mathematics and Data Science\"\nand the basic principles by looking at something\ncalled Bayes' theorem. And if you're familiar\nwith regular probability and influential testing,\nyou can think of Bayes' theorem as the flip\nside of the coin. You can also think of it\nin terms of intersections. So for instance,\nstandard inferential tests and calculations\ngive you the probability of the data; that's\nour d, given the hypothesis. So, if you assume\na known hypothesis is true, this will give\nyou the probability of the data arising by\nchance. The trick is, most people actually\nwant the opposite of that. They want the probability\nof the hypothesis given the data. And unfortunately,\nthose two things can be very different in\nmany circumstances. On the other hand, there's\na way of dealing with it, Bayes does it and\nthis is our guy right here. Reverend Thomas\nBayes, 18th Century English minister and statistician.\nHe developed a method for getting what he\ncalled posterior probabilities that use as\nprior probabilities. And test information\nor something like base rates, how common something\noverall to get the posterior or after the\nfact Probability. Here's the general recipe\nto how this works: You start with the probability\nof the data given the hypothesis which is\nwhat you get from the likelihood of the data.\nYou also get that from a standard inferential\ntest. To that, you need to add the probability\nto the hypothesis or the cause of being true.\nThat's called the prior or the prior probability.\nTo that you add the D; the probability of\nthe data, that's called the marginal probability.\nAnd then you combine those and in a special\nway to get the probability of the hypothesis\ngiven the data or the posterior probability.\nNow, if you want to write it as an equation,\nyou can write it in words like this; posterior\nis equal to likelihood times prior divided\nby marginal. You can also write it in symbols\nlike this; the probability of H given D, the\nprobability of the hypothesis given the data,\nthat's the posterior probability. Is equal\nto the probability of the data given the hypothesis,\nthat the likelihood, multiplied by the probability\nof the hypothesis and divided by probability\nof the data overall. But this is a lot easier\nif we look at a visual version of it. So,\nlet's go this example here. Let's say we have\na square here that represents 100% of all\npeople and we are looking at a medical condition.\nAnd what we are going to say here is that\nwe got this group up here that represents\npeople who have a disease, so that's a portion\nof all people. And that what we say, is we\nhave a test and people with the disease, 90%\nof them will test positive, so they're marked\nin red. Now it does mean over here on the\nfar left people with the disease who test\nnegative that's 10%. Those are our false negatives.\nAnd so if the test catches 90% of the people\nwho have the disease, that's good right? Well,\nlet's look at it this way. Let me ask y0u\na basic question. \"If a person tests positive\nfor a disease, then what is the probability\nthey really have the disease?\" And if you\nwant a hint, I'm going to give you one. It's\nnot 90%,. Here's how it goes. So this is the\ninformation I gave you before and we've got\n90% of the people who have the disease; that's\na conditional probability, they test positive.\nBut what about the other people, the people\nin the big white area below, ‘of all people'.\nWe need to look at them and if any of them\never test positive, do we ever get false positives\nand with any test you are going to get false\npositives. And so let's say our people without\nthe disease, 90% of them test negative, the\nway they should. But of the people who don't\nhave the disease, 10% of them test positive,\nthose are false positives. And so if you really\nwant to answer the question, \"If you test\npositive do you have the disease?\", here's\nwhat you need. What you need is the number\nof people with the disease who test positive\ndivided by all people who test positive. Let's\nlook at it this way. So here's our information.\nWe've got 29.7% of all people are in this\ndarker red box, those are the people who have\nthe disease and test positive, alright that's\ngood. Then we have 6.7% of the entire group,\nthat's the people without the disease who\ntest positive. So we want to do, we want the\nprobability of the disease what percentage\nhave the disease and test positive and then\ndivide that by all the people that test positive.\nAnd that bottom part is made up of two things.\nThat's made up of the people who have the\ndisease and test positive, and the people\nwho don't have the disease and test positive.\nNow we can take our numbers and start plugging\nthem in. Those who have the disease and test\npositive that's 29.7% of the total population\nof everybody. We can also put that number\nright here. That's fine, but we also need\nto look at the percentage that do not have\nthe disease and test positive; of the total\npopulation, that's 6.7%. So, we just need\nto rearrange, we add those two numbers on\nthe bottom, we get 36.4% and we do a little\nbit of division. And the number we get is\n81.6%, here's what that means. A positive\ntest result still only means a probability\nof 81.6% of having the disease. So, the test\nis advertised at having 90% accuracy, well\nif you test positive there's really only a\n82% chance you have the disease. Now that's\nnot really a big difference. But consider\nthis: what if the numbers change? For instance,\nwhat if the probability of the disease changes?\nHere's what we originally had. Let's move\nit around a little bit. Let's make the disease\nmuch less common. And so now what we do, we\nare going to have 4.5% of all people are people\nwho have the disease and test positive. And\nthen because there is a larger number of people\nwho don't have the disease, we are going to\nhave a relatively larger proportion of false\npositives. Again, compared to the entire population\nit's going to be 9.5% of everybody. So we\nare going to go back to our formula here in\nwords and start plugging in the numbers. We\nget 4.5% right there, and right there. And\nthen we add in our other number, the false\npositives that's 9.5%. Well, we rearrange\nand we start adding things up, that's 14%\nand when we divide that, we get 32.1%. Here's\nwhat that number means. That means a positive\ntest result; you get a positive test result,\nnow means you only have a probability of 32.1%\nof having the disease. That's ? less than\nthe accuracy of 90%, and in case you can't\ntell, that's a really big difference. And\nthat's why Bayes theorem matters, because\nit answers the questions that people want\nand the answer can be dramatically different\ndepending on the base rate of the thing you\nare talking about. And so in sum, we can say\nthis. Bayes theorem allows you to answer the\nright question, people really want to know;\nwhat's the probability that I have the disease.\nWhat's the probability of getting a positive\nif I have the disease. They want to know whether\nthey have the disease. And to do this, you\nneed to have prior probabilities, you need\nto know how common the disease is, you need\nto know how many people get positive test\nresults overall. But, if you can get that\ninformation and run them through it can change\nyour answers and really the emotional significance\nof what you're dealing with dramatically.\nLet's wrap up some of our discussion of \"Mathematics\nand Data Science\" and the data principles\nand talk about some of the next steps. Things\nyou can do afterwards. Probably the most important\nthing is, you may have learned about math\na long time ago but now it's a good time to\ndig out some of those books and go over some\nof the principles you've used before. The\nidea here is that a little math can go a long\nway in data science. So, things like Algebra\nand things like Calculus and things like Big\nO and Probability. All of those are important\nin data science and its helpful to have at\nleast a working understanding of each. You\ndon't have to know everything, but you do\nneed to understand the principles of your\nprocedures that you select when you do your\nprojects. There are two reasons for that very\ngenerally speaking. First, you need to know\nif a procedure will actually answer your question.\nDoes it give you the outcome that you need?\nWill it give you the insight that you need?\nSecond; really critical, you need to know\nwhat to do when things go wrong. Things don't\nalways work out, numbers don't always add\nup, you got impossible results or things just\naren't responding. You need to know enough\nabout the procedure and enough about the mathematics\nbehind it, so you can diagnose the problem,\nand respond appropriately. And to repeat myself\nonce again, no matter what you're working\non in data science, no matter what tool you're\nusing, what procedure you're doing, focus\non your goal. And in case you can't remember\nthat, your goal is meaning. Your goal is always\nmeaning. Welcome to \"Statistics in Data Science\".\nI'm Barton Poulson and what we are going to\nbe doing in this course is talking about some\nof the ways you can use statistics to see\nthe unseen. To infer what's there, even when\nmost of it's hidden. Now this shouldn't be\nsurprised. If you remember the data science\nVenn Diagram we talked about a while ago,\nwe have math up here at the top right corner,\nbut if you were to go to the original description\nof this Venn Diagram, it's full name was math\nand stats. And let me just mention something\nin case it's not completely obvious about\nwhy statistics matters to data science. And\nthe idea is this; counting is easy. It's easy\nto say how many times a word appears in a\ndocument, it's easy to say how many people\nvoted for a particular candidate in one part\nof the country. Counting is easy, but summarizing\nand generalizing those things hard. And part\nof the problem is there's no such thing as\na definitive analysis. All analyses really,\ndepend on the purposes that you're dealing\nwith. So as an example, let me give you a\ncouple of pairs of words and try to summarize\nthe difference between them in just two or\nthree words. In a word or two, how is a souffle\ndifferent from a quiche, or how is an Aspen\ndifferent from a Pine tree? Or how is Baseball\ndifferent from Cricket? And how are musicals\ndifferent from opera? It really depends on\nwho you are talking to, it depends on your\ngoals and it depends on the shared knowledge.\nAnd so, there's not a single definitive answer,\nand then there's the matter of generalization.\nThink about it again, take music. Listen to\nthree concerti by Antonio Vivaldi, and do\nyou think you can safely and accurately describe\nall of his music? Now, I actually chose Vivaldi\non purpose because even Igor Stravinsky said\nyou could, he said he didn't write 500 concertos\nhe wrote the same concerto 500 times. But,\ntake something more real world like politics.\nIf you talk to 400 registered voters in the\nUS, can you then accurately predict the behavior\nof all of the voters? There's about 100 million\nvoters in the US, and that's a matter of generalization.\nThat's the sort of thing we try to take care\nof with inferential statistics. Now there\nare different methods that you can use in\nstatistics and all of them are described to\ngive you a map; a description of the data\nyou're working on. There are descriptive statistics,\nthere are inferential statistics, there's\nthe inferential procedure Hypothesis testing\nand there's also estimation and I'll talk\nabout each of those in more depth. There are\na lot of choices that have to be made and\nsome of the things I'm going to discuss in\ndetail are for instance the choice of Estimators,\nthat's different from estimation. Different\nmeasures of fit. Feature selection, for knowing\nwhich variables are the most important in\npredicting your outcome. Also common problems\nthat arise when trying to model data and the\nprinciples of model validation. But through\nthis all, the most important thing to remember\nis that analysis is functional. It's designed\nto serve a particular purpose. And there's\na very wonderful quote within the statistics\nworld that says all models are wrong. All\nstatistical descriptions of reality are wrong,\nbecause they are not exact depictions, they\nare summaries but some are useful and that's\nfrom George Box. And so the question is, you're\nnot trying to be totally, completely accurate,\nbecause in that case you just wouldn't do\nan analysis. The real question is, are you\nbetter off not doing your analysis than not\ndoing it? And truthfully, I bet you are. So\nin sum, we can say three things: #1, you want\nto use statistics to both summarize your data\nand to generalize from one group to another\nif you can. On the other hand, there is no\n\"one true answer\" with data, you got to be\nflexible in terms of what your goals are and\nthe shared knowledge. And no matter what your\ndoing, the utility of your analysis should\nguide you in your decisions. The first thing\nwe want to cover in \"Statistics in Data Science\"\nis the principles of exploring data and this\nvideo is just designed to give an exploration\noverview. So we like to think of it like this,\nthe intrepid explorers, they're out there\nexploring and seeing what's in the world.\nYou can see what's in your data, more specifically\nyou want to see what your dataset is like.\nYou want to see if your assumptions are right\nso you can do a valid analysis with your procedure.\nSomething that may sound very weird, but you\nwant to listen to your data. Something's not\nwork out, if it's not going the way you want,\nthen you're going to have to pay attention\nand exploratory data analysis is going to\nhelp you do that. Now, there are two general\napproaches to this. First off, there's a graphical\nexploration, so you use graphs and pictures\nand visualizations to explore your data. The\nreason you want to do this is that graphics\nare very dense in information. They're also\nreally good, in fact the best to get the overall\nimpression of your data. Second to that, there\nis numerical exploration. I make it very clear,\nthis is the second step. Do the visualization\nfirst, then do the numerical part. Now you\nwant to do this, because this can give greater\nprecision, this is also an opportunity to\ntry variations on the data. You can actually\ndo some transformations, move things around\na little bit and try different methods and\nsee how that effects the results, see how\nit looks. So, let's go first to the graphical\npart. They are very quick and simple plots\nthat you can do. Those include things like\nbar charts, histograms and scatterplots, very\neasy to make and a very quick way to getting\nto understand the variables in your dataset.\nIn terms of numerical analysis; again after\nthe graphical method, you can do things like\ntransform the data, that is take like the\nlogarithm of your numbers. You can do Empirical\nestimates of population numbers, and you can\nuse robust methods. And I'll talk about all\nof those at length in later videos. But for\nright now, I can sum it up this way. The purpose\nof exploration is to help you get to know\nyour data. And also you want to explore your\ndata thoroughly before you start modelling,\nbefore you build statistical models. And all\nthe way through you want to make sure you\nlisten carefully so that you can find hidden\nor unassumed details and leads in your data.\nAs we move in our discussion of \"Statistics\nand Exploring Data\", the single most important\nthing we can do is Exploratory Graphics. In\nthe words of the late great Yankees catcher\nYogi Berra, \"You can see a lot by just looking\".\nAnd that applies to data as much as it applies\nto baseball. Now, there's a few reasons you\nwant to start with graphics. #1, is to actually\nget a feel for the data. I mean, what's it\ndistributed like, what's the shape, are there\nstrange things going on. Also it allows you\nto check the assumptions and see how well\nyour data match the requirements of the analytical\nprocedures you hope to use. You can check\nfor anomalies like outliers and unusual distributions\nand errors and also you can get suggestions.\nIf something unusual is happening in the data,\nthat might be a clue that you need to pursue\na different angle or do a deeper analysis.\nNow we want to do graphics first for a couple\nof reasons. #1, is they are very information\ndense, and fundamentally humans are visual.\nIt's our single, highest bandwidth way of\ngetting information. It's also the best way\nto check for shape and gaps and outliers.\nThere's a few ways that you can do this if\nyou want to and the first is with programs\nthat rely on code. So you can use the statistical\nprogramming language R, the general purpose\nlanguage Python. You can actually do a huge\namount in JavaScript, especially D3JS. Or\nyou can use Apps, that are specifically designed\nfor exploratory analysis, that includes Tableau\nboth the desktop and public versions, Qlik\nand even Excel is a good way to do this. And\nfinally you can do this by hand. John Tukey\nwho's the father of Exploratory Data Analysis,\nwrote his seminal book, a wonderful book where\nit's all hand graphics and actually it's a\nwonderful way to do it. But let's start the\nprocess for doing these graphics. We start\nwith one variable. That is univariate distributions.\nAnd so you'll get something like this, the\nfundamental chart is the bar chart. This is\nwhen you are dealing with categories and you\nare simply counting however many cases there\nare in each category. The nice thing about\nbar charts is they are really easy to read.\nPut them in descending order and may be have\nthem vertical, maybe have them horizontal.\nHorizontal could be nice to make the labels\na little easier to read. This is about psychological\nprofiles of the United States, this is real\ndata. We have most states in the friendly\nand conventional, a smaller amount in the\ntemperamental and uninhibited and the least\ncommon of the United States is relaxed and\ncreative. Next you can do a Box plot, or sometimes\ncalled a box and whiskers plot. This is when\nyou have a quantitative variable, something\nthat's measured and you can say how far apart\nscores are. A box plot shows quartile values,\nit also shows outliers. So for instance this\nis google searches for modern dance. That's\nUtah at 5 standard deviations above the national\naverage. That's where I'm from and I'm glad\nto see that there. Also, it's a nice way to\nshow many variables side by side, if they\nare on proximately similar scales. Next, if\nyou have quantitative variables, you are going\nto want to do a histogram. Again, quantitative\nso interval or ratio level, or measured variables.\nAnd these let you see the shape of a distribution\nand potentially compare many. So, here are\nthree histograms of google searches on Data\nScience, and Entrepreneur and Modern Dance.\nAnd you can see, mostly for the part normally\ndistributed with a couple of outliers. Once\nyou've done one variable, or the univariate\nanalyses, you're going to want to do two variables\nat a time. That is bivariate distributions\nor joint distributions. Now, one easy way\nto do this is with grouped plots. You can\ndo grouped bar charts and box plots. What\nI have here is grouped box plots. I have my\nthree regions, Psychological Regions of the\nUnited States and I'm showing how they rank\non openness that's a psychological characteristic.\nAs you can see, the relaxed and creative are\nhigh and the friendly conventional tend to\ngo to the lowest and that's kind of how that\nworks. It's also a good way of seeing the\nassociation between a categorical variable\nlike region of the United States psychologically,\nand a quantitative outcome, which is what\nwe have here with openness. Next, you can\nalso do a Scatterplot. That's where you have\nquantitative variables and what you're looking\nfor here is, is it a straight line? Is it\nlinear? Do we have outliers? And also the\nstrength of association. How closely do the\ndots all come to the regression line that\nwe have here in the middle. And this is an\ninteresting one for me because we have openness\nacross the bottom, so more open as you go\nto the right and agreeableness. And what you\ncan see is there is a strong downhill association.\nThe states and the states that are the most\nopen are also the least agreeable, so we're\ngoing to have to do something about that.\nAnd then finally, you're going to want to\ngo to many variables, that is multivariate\ndistributions. Now, one big question here\nis 3D or not 3D? Let me make an argument for\nnot 3D. So, what I have here is a 3D Scatterplot\nabout 3 variables from Google searches. Up\nthe left, I have FIFA which is for professional\nsoccer. Down there on the bottom left, I have\nsearches for the NFL and on the right I have\nsearches for NBA. Now, I did this in R and\nwhat's neat about this is you can click and\ndrag and move it around. And you know that's\nkind of fun, you kind of spin around and it\ngets kind of nauseating as you look at it.\nAnd this particular version, I'm using plotly\nin R, allows you to actually click on a point\nand see, let me see if I can get the floor\nin the right place. You can click on a point\nand see where it ranks on each of these characteristics.\nYou can see however, this thing is hard to\ncontrol and once it stops moving, it's not\nmuch fun and truthfully most 3D plots I've\nworked with are just kind of nightmares. They\nseem like they're a good idea, but not really.\nSo, here's the deal. 3D graphics, like the\none I just showed you, because they are actually\nbeing shown in 2D, they have to be in motion\nfor you to tell what is going on at all. And\nfundamentally they are hard to read and confusing.\nNow it's true, they might be useful for finding\nclusters in 3 dimensions, we didn't see that\nin the data we had, but generally I just avoid\nthem like the plague. What you do want to\ndo however, is see the connection between\nthe variables, you might want to use a matrix\nof plots. This is where you have for instance\nmany quantitative variables, you can use markers\nfor group membership if you want, and I find\nit to be much clearer than 3D. So here, I\nhave the relationship between 4 search terms:\nNBA, NFL, MLB for Major League Baseball and\nFIFA. You can see the individual distributions,\nyou can see the scatterplots, you can get\nthe correlation. Truthfully for me this is\na much easier chart to read and you can get\nthe richness that we need, from a multidimensional\ndisplay. So the questions you're trying to\nanswer overall are: Number 1, Do you have\nwhat you need? Do you have the variables that\nyou need, do you have the ability that you\nneed? Are there clumps or gaps in the distributions?\nAre there exceptional cases/anomalies that\nare really far out from everybody else, spikes\nin the scores? And of course are there errors\nin the data? Are there mistakes in coding,\ndid people forget to answer questions? Are\nthere impossible combinations? And these kinds\nof things are easiest to see with a visualization\nthat really kind of puts it there in front\nof you. And so in sum, I can say this about\ngraphical exploration of data. It's a critical\nfirst step, it's basically where you always\nwant to start. And you want to use the quick\nand easy methods, again. Bar charts, scatter\nplots are really easy to make and they're\nvery easy to understand. And once you're done\nwith the graphical exploration, then you can\ngo to the second step, which is exploring\nthe data through numbers. The next step in\n\"Statistics and Exploring Data\" is exploratory\nstatistics or numerical exploration of data.\nI like to think of this, as go in order. First,\nyou do visualization, then you do the numerical\npart. And a couple of things to remember here.\n#1, you are still exploring the data. You're\nnot modeling yet, but you are doing a quantitative\nexploration. This might be an opportunity\nto get empirical estimates, that is of population\nparameters as opposed to theoretically based\nones. It's a good time to manipulate the data\nand explore the effect of manipulating the\ndata, looking at subgroups, looking at transforming\nvariables. Also, it's an opportunity to check\nthe sensitivity of your results. Do you get\nthe same general results if you test under\ndifferent circumstances. So we are going to\ntalk about things like Robust Statistics,\nresampling data and transforming data. So,\nwe'll start with Robust Statistics. This by\nthe way is Hercules, a Robust mythical character.\nAnd the idea with robust statistics is that\nthey are stable, is that even when the data\nvaries in unpredictable ways you still get\nthe same general impression. This is a class\nof statistics, it's an entire category, that's\nless affected by outliers, and skewness, kurtosis\nand other abnormalities in the data. So let's\ntake a quick look. This is a very skewed distribution\nthat I created. The median, which is the dark\nline in the box, is right around one. And\nI am going to look at two different kinds\nof robust statistics, The Trimmed Mean and\nthe Winsorized Mean. With the Trimmed mean,\nyou take a certain percentage of data from\nthe top and the bottom and you just throw\nit away and compute for the rest. With the\nWinsorized, you take those and you move those\nscores into the highest non-outlier score.\nNow the 0% is exactly the same as the regular\nmean and here it's 1.24, but as we trim off\nor move in 5%, the mean shifts a little bit.\nThen 10 % it comes in a little bit more to\n25%, now we are throwing away 50% of our data.\n25% on the top and 25% on the bottom. And\nwe get a trimmed mean of 1.03 and a winsorized\nof 1.07. When we throw away 50% or we trim\n50%, that actually means we are leaving just\nthe median, only the middle scores left. Then\nwe get 1.01. What's interesting is how close\nwe get to that, even when we have 50% of the\ndata left, and so that's an interesting example\nof how you can use robust statistics to explore\ndata, even when you have things like strong\nskewness. Next is the principle of resampling.\nAnd that's like pulling marbles repeatedly\nfrom the jar, counting the colors, putting\nthem back in and trying again. That's an empirical\nestimate of sampling variability. So, sometimes\nyou get 20% red marbles, sometimes you get\n30, sometimes you get 22 and so on. There\nare several versions for this, they go by\nthe name jackknife, the bootstrap the permutation.\nAnd the basic principle of resampling is also\nkey to the process of cross-validation, I'll\nhave more to say about validation later. And\nthen finally there's transforming variables.\nHere's our caterpillars in the process of\ntransforming into butterflies. But the idea\nhere, is that you take a difficult data set\nand then you do what's called a smooth function.\nThere's no jumps in it, and something that\nallows you to preserve the order and work\non the full dataset. So you can fix skewed\ndata, and in a scatter plot you might have\na curved line, you can fix that. And probably\nthe best way to look at this is probably with\nsomething called Tukey's ladder of powers.\nI mentioned before John Tukey, the father\nof exploratory data analysis. He talked a\nlot about data transformations. This is his\nladder, starting at the bottom with the -1,\nover x2, up to the top with x3. Here's how\nit works, this distribution over here is a\nsymmetrical normally distributed variable,\nand as you start to move in one direction\nand you apply the transformation, take the\nsquare root you see how it moves the distribution\nover to one end. Then the logarithm, then\nyou get to the end then you get to this minus\n1 over the square of the score. And that pushes\nit way way, way over. If you go the other\ndirection, for instance you square the score,\nit pushes it down in the one direction and\nthen you cube it and then you see how it can\nmove it around in ways that allow you to,\nyou can actually undo the skewness to get\nback to a more centrally distributed distribution.\nAnd so these are some of the approaches that\nyou can use in the numerical distribution\nof data. In sum, let's say this: statistical\nor numerical exploration allows you to get\nmultiple perspectives on your data. It also\nallows you to check the stability, see how\nit works with outliers, and skewness and mixed\ndistributions and so on. And perhaps most\nimportant it sets the stage for the statistical\nmodelling of your data. As a final step of\n\"Statistics and Exploring Data\", I'm going\nto talk about something that's not usually\nexploring data but it is basic descriptive\nstatistics. I like to think of it this way.\nYou've got some data, and you are trying to\ntell a story. More specifically, you're trying\nto tell your data's story. And with descriptive\nstatistics, you can think of it as trying\nto use a little data to stand in for a lot\nof data. Using a few numbers to stand in for\na large collection of numbers. And this is\nconsistent with the advice we get from good\nole Henry David Thoreau, who told us Simplify,\nSimplify. If you can tell your story with\nmore carefully chosen and more informative\ndata, go for it. So there's a few different\nprocedures for doing this. #1, you'll want\nto describe the center of your distribution\nof data, that is if you're going to choose\na single number, use that. # 2, if you can\ngive a second number give something about\nthe spread or the dispersion of the variability.\nAnd #3, give something about the shape of\nthe distribution. Let me say more about each\nof these in turn. First, let's talk about\ncenter. We have the center of our rings here.\nNow there are a few very common measure of\ncenter or location or central tendency of\na distribution. There's the mode, the median\nand there's the mean. Now, there are many,\nmany others but those are the ones that are\ngoing to get you most of the way. Let's talk\nabout the mode first. Now, I'm going to create\na little dataset here on a scale from 1 to\n11, and I'm going to put individual scores.\nThere's a one, and another one, and another\none and another one. Then we have a two, two,\nthen we have a score way over at 9 and another\nscore over at 11. So we have 8 scores, and\nthis is the distribution. This is actually\na histogram of the dataset. The mode is the\nmost commonly occurring score or the most\nfrequent score. Well, if you look at how tall\neach of these go, we have more ones than anything\nelse, and so one is the mode. Because it occurs\n4 times and nothing else comes close to that.\nThe median is a little different. The median\nis looking for the score that is at the center\nif you split it into two equal groups. We\nhave 8 scores, so we have to get one group\nof 4, that's down here, and the other group\nof four, this really big one because it's\nway out and the median is going to be the\nplace on the number line that splits those\ninto two groups. That's going to be right\nhere at one and a half. Now the mean is going\nto be a little more complicated, even though\npeople understand means in general. It's the\nfirst one here that actually has a formula,\nwhere M for the mean is equal to the sum of\nX (that's our scores on the variable), divided\nby N (the number of scores). You can also\nwrite it out with Greek notation if you want,\nlike this where that's sigma - a capital sigma\nis the summation sign, sum of X divided by\nN. And with our little dataset, that works\nout to this: one plus one plus one plus one\nplus two plus two plus nine plus eleven. Add\nthose all up and divide by 8, because that's\nhow many scores there are. Well that reduces\nto 28 divided by 8, which is equal to 3.5.\nIf you go back to our little chart here, 3.5\nis right over here. You'll notice there aren't\nany scores really exactly right there. That's\nbecause the mean tends to get very distorted\nby its outliers, it follows the extreme scores.\nBut a really nice, I say it's more than just\na visual analogy, is that if this number were\na sea saw, then the mean is exactly where\nthe balance point or the fulcrum would be\nfor these to be equal. People understand that.\nIf somebody weighs more they got to sit in\ncloser to balance someone who less, who has\nto sit further out, and that's how the mean\nworks. Now, let me give a bit of the pros\nand cons of each of these. Mode is easy to\ndo, you just count how common it is. On the\nother hand, it may not be close to what appears\nto be the center of the data. The Median it\nsplits the data into two same size groups,\nthe same number of scores in each and that's\npretty easy to deal with but unfortunately,\nit's pretty hard to use that information in\nany statistics after that. And finally the\nmean, of these three it's the least intuitive,\nit's the most effective by outliers and skewness\nand that really may strike against it, but\nit is the most useful statistically and so\nit's the one that gets used most often. Next,\nthere's the issue of spread, spread your tail\nfeathers. And we have a few measures here\nthat are pretty common also. There's the range,\nthere are percentiles and interquartile range\nand there's variance and standard deviation.\nI'll talk about each of those. First the Range.\nThe Range is simply the maximum score minus\nthe minimum score, and in our case that's\n11 minus 1, which is equal to 10, so we have\na range of 10. I can show you that on our\nchart. It's just that line on the bottom from\nthe 11 down to the one. That's a range of\n10. The interquartile range which is actually\nusually referred to simply as the IQR is the\ndistance between the Q3; which is the third\nquartile score and Q1; which is the first\nquartile score. If you're not familiar with\nquartiles, it's the same the 75th percentile\nscore and the 25th percentile score. Really\nwhat it is, is you're going to throw away\nsome of the some of the data. So let's go\nto our distribution here. First thing we are\ngoing to do, we are going to throw away the\ntwo highest scores, there they are, they're\ngreyed out now, and then we are going to throw\naway two of the lowest scores, they're out\nthere. Then we are going to get the range\nfor the remaining ones. Now, this is complicated\nby the fact that I have this big gap between\n2 and 9, and different methods of calculating\nquartiles do something with that gap. So if\nyou use a spreadsheet it's actually going\nto do an interpolation process and it will\ngive you a value of 3.75, I believe. And then\ndown to one for the first quartile, so not\nso intuitive with this graph but that it is\nhow it works usually. If you want to write\nit out, you can do it like this. The interquartile\nrange is equal to Q3 minus Q1, and in our\nparticular case that's 3.75 minus 1. And that\nof course is equal to just 2.75 and there\nyou have it. Now our final measure of spread\nor variability or dispersion, is two related\nmeasures, the variance and the standard deviation.\nThese are little harder to explain and a little\nharder to show. But the variance, which is\nat least the easiest formula, is this: the\nvariance is equal to that's the sum, the capital\nsigma that's the sum, X minus M; that's how\nfar each score is from the mean and then you\ntake that deviation there and you square it,\nyou add up all the deviations, and then you\ndivide by the number. So the variance is,\nthe average square deviation from the mean.\nI'll try to show you that graphically. So\nhere's our dataset and there's our mean right\nthere at 3 and a half. Let's go to one of\nthese twos. We have a deviation there of 1.5\nand if we make a square, that's 1.5 points\non each side, well there it is. We can do\na similar square for the other score too.\nIf we are going down to one, then it's going\nto be 2.5 squared and it's going to be that\nmuch bigger, and we can draw one of these\nsquares for each one of our 8 points. The\nsquares for the scores at 9 and 11 are going\nto be huge and go off the page, so I'm not\ngoing to show them. But once you have all\nthose squares you add up the area and you\nget the variance. So, this is the formula\nfor the variance, but now let me show the\nstandard deviation which is also a very common\nmeasure. It's closely related to this, specifically\nit's just the square root of the variance.\nNow, there's a catch here. The formulas for\nthe variance and the standard deviation are\nslightly different for populations and samples\nin that they use different denominators. But\nthey give similar answers, not identical but\nsimilar if the sample is reasonably large,\nsay over 30 or 50, then it's really going\nto be just a negligible difference. So let's\ndo a little pro and con of these three things.\nFirst, the Range. It's very easy to do, it\nonly uses two numbers the high and the low,\nbut it's determined entirely by those two\nnumbers. And if they're outliers, then you've\ngot really a bad situation. The Interquartile\nRange the IQR, is really good for skewed data\nand that's because it ignores extremes on\neither end, so that's nice. And the variance\nand the standard deviation while they are\nthe least intuitive and they are the most\naffected by outliers, they are also generally\nthe most useful because they feed into so\nmany other procedures that are used in data\nscience. Finally, let's talk a little bit\nabout the shape of the distribution. You can\nhave symmetrical or skew distribution, unimodal,\nuniform or u-shaped. You can have outliers,\nthere's a lot of variations. Let me show you\na few of them. First off is a symmetrical\ndistribution, pretty easy. They're the same\non the left and on the right. And this little\npyramid shape is an example of a symmetrical\ndistribution. There are also skewed distributions,\nwhere most of the scores are on one end and\nthey taper off. This here is a positively\nskewed distribution where most of the scores\nare at the low end and the outliers are on\nthe high end. This is unimodal, our same pyramid\nshape. Unimodal means it has one mode, really\nkind of one hump in the data. That's contrasted\nfor instance to bimodal where you have two\nmodes, and that usually happens when you have\ntwo distributions that got mixed together.\nThere is also uniform distribution where every\nresponse is equally common, there's u-shaped\ndistributions where people tend to pile up\nat one end or the other and a big dip in the\nmiddle. And so there's a lot of different\nvariations, and you want to get those, the\nshape of the distribution to help you understand\nand put the numerical summaries like the mean\nand like the standard deviation and put those\ninto context. In sum, we can say this: when\nyou use this script of statistics that allows\nyou to be concise with your data, tell the\nstory and tell it succinctly. You want to\nfocus on things like the center of the data,\nthe spread of the data, the shape of the data.\nAnd above all, watch out for anomalies, because\nthey can exercise really undue influence on\nyour interpretations but this will help you\nbetter understand your data and prepare you\nfor the steps to follow. As we discuss \"Statistics\nin Data Science\", one of the really big topics\nis going to be Inference. And I'll begin that\nwith just a general discussion of inferential\nstatistics. But, I'd like to begin unusually\nwith a joke, you may have seen this before\nit says \"There are two kinds of people in\nthe world. 1) Those you can extrapolate from\nincomplete data and, the end\". Of course,\nbecause the other group is the people who\ncan't. But let's talk about extrapolating\nfrom incomplete data or inferring from incomplete\ndata. First thing you need to know is the\ndifference between populations and samples.\nA population represents all of the data, or\nevery possible case in your group of interest.\nIt might be everybody who's a commercial pilot,\nit might be whatever. But it represents everybody\nin that or every case in that group that you're\ninterested in. And the thing with the population\nis, it just is what it is. It has its values,\nit has it's mean and standard deviation and\nyou are trying to figure out what those are,\nbecause you generally use those in doing your\nanalyses. On the other hand, samples instead\nof being all of the data are just some of\nthe data. And the trick is they are sampled\nwith error. You sample one group and you calculate\nthe mean. It's not going to be the same if\nyou do it the second time, and it's that variability\nthat's in sampling that makes Inference a\nlittle tricky. Now, also in inference there\nare two very general approaches. There's testing\nwhich is short for hypothesis testing and\nmaybe you've had some experience with this.\nThis is where you assume a null hypothesis\nof no effect is true. You get your data and\nyou calculate the probability of getting the\nsample data that you have if the null hypothesis\nis true. And if that value is small, usually\nless than 5%, then you reject the null hypothesis\nwhich says really nothings happen and you\ninfer that there is a difference in the population.\nThe other most common version is Estimation.\nWhich for instance is characterizing confidence\nintervals. That's not the only version of\nEstimation but it's the most common. And this\nis where you sample data to estimate a population\nparameter value directly, so you use the sample\nmean to try to infer what the population mean\nis. You have to choose a confidence level,\nyou have to calculate your values and you\nget high and low bounds for you estimate that\nwork with a certain level of confidence. Now,\nwhat makes both of these tricky is the basic\nconcept of sampling error. I have a colleague\nwho demonstrates this with colored M&M's,\nwhat percentage are red, and you get them\nout of the bags and you count. Now, let's\ntalk about this, a population of numbers.\nI'm going to give you just a hypothetical\npopulation of the numbers 1 through 10. And\nwhat I am going to do, is I am going to sample\nfrom those numbers randomly, with replacement.\nThat means I pull a number out, it might be\na one and I put it back, I might get the one\nagain. So I'm going to sample with replacement,\nwhich actually may sound a little bit weird,\nbut it's really helpful for the mathematics\nbehind inference. And here are the samples\nthat I got, I actually did this with software.\nI got a 3, 1, 5, and 7. Interestingly, that\nis almost all odd numbers, almost. My second\nsample is 4, 4, 3, 6 and 10. So you can see\nI got the 4 twice. And I didn't get the 1,\nthe 2, the 5, 7, or 8 or 9. The third sample\nI got three 1's! And a 10 and a 9, so we are\nway at the ends there. And then my fourth\nsample, I got a 3, 9, 2, 6, 5. All of these\nwere drawn at random from the exact same population,\nbut you see that the samples are very different.\nThat's the sampling variability or the sampling\nerror. And that's what makes inference a little\ntrickier. And let's just say again, why the\nsampling variability, why it matters. It's\nbecause inferential methods like testing and\nlike estimation try to see past the random\nsampling variation to get a clear picture\non the underlying population. So in sum, let's\nsay this about Inferential Statistics. You\nsample your data from the larger populations,\nand as you try to interpret it, you have to\nadjust for error and there's a few different\nways of doing that. And the most common approaches\nare testing or hypothesis testing and estimation\nof parameter values. The next step in our\ndiscussion of \"Statistics and Inference\" is\nHypothesis Testing. A very common procedure\nin some fields of research. I like to think\nof it as put your money where your mouth is\nand test your theory. Here's the Wright brothers\nout testing their plane. Now the basic idea\nbehind hypothesis testing is this, and you\nstart out with a question. You start out with\nsomething like this: What is the probability\nof X occurring by chance, if randomness or\nmeaningless sampling variation is the only\nexplanation? Well, the response is this, if\nthe probability of that data arising by chance\nwhen nothing's happening is low, then you\nreject randomness as a likely explanation.\nOkay, there's a few things I can say about\nthis. #1, it's really common in scientific\nresearch, say for instance in the social sciences,\nit's used all the time. #2, this kind of approach\ncan be really helpful in medical diagnostics,\nwhere you're trying to make a yes/no decision;\ndoes a person have a particular disease. And\n3, really anytime you're trying to make a\ngo/no go decision, which might be made for\ninstance with a purchasing decision for a\nschool district or implementing a particular\nlaw, You base it on the data and you have\nto make a yes/no. Hypothesis testing might\nbe helpful in those situations. Now, you have\nto have hypotheses to do hypothesis testing.\nYou start with H0, which is shorthand for\nthe null hypothesis. And what that is in larger,\nwhat that is in lengthier terms is that there\nis no systematic effect between groups, there's\nno effect between variables and random sampling\nerror is the only explanation for any observed\ndifferences you see. And then contrast that\nwith HA, which is the alternative hypothesis.\nAnd this really just says there is a systematic\neffect, that there is in fact a correlation\nbetween variables, that there is in fact a\ndifference between two groups, that this variable\ndoes in fact predict the other one. Let's\ntake a look at the simplest version of this\nstatistically speaking. Now, what I have here\nis a null distribution. This is a bell curve,\nit's actually the standard normal distribution.\nWhich shows z-scores in relative frequency,\nand what you do with this is you mark off\nregions of rejection. And so I've actually\nshaded off the highest 2.5% of the distribution\nand the lowest 2.5%. What's funny about this\nis, is that even though I draw it +/- 3, it\nlooks like 0. It's actually infinite and asymptotic.\nBut, that's the highest and lowest 2.5% collectively\nleaves 95% in the middle. Now, the idea is\nthen that you gather your data, you calculate\na score for you data and you see where it\nfalls in this distribution. And I like to\nthink of that as you have to go down one path\nto the other, you have to make a decision.\nAnd you have to decide to whether to retain\nyour null hypothesis; maybe it is random,\nor reject it and decide no I don't think it's\nrandom. The trick is, things can go wrong.\nYou can get a false positive, and this is\nwhen the sample shows some kind of statistical\neffect, but it's really randomness. And so\nfor instance, this scatterplot I have here,\nyou can see a little down hill association\nhere but this is in fact drawn from data that\nhas a true correlation of zero. And I just\nkind of randomly sampled from it, it took\nabout 20 rounds, but it looks negative but\nreally there's nothing happening. The trick\nabout false positives is; that's conditional\non rejecting the null. The only way to get\na false positive is if you actually conclude\nthat there's a positive result. It goes by\nthe highly descriptive name of a Type I error,\nbut you get to pick a value for it, and .05\nor a 5% risk if you reject the null hypothesis,\nthat's the most common value. Then there's\na false negative. This is when the data looks\nrandom, but in fact, it's systematic or there's\na relationship. So for instance, this scatterplot\nit looks like there's pretty much a zero relationship,\nbut in fact this came from two variables that\nwere correlated at .25, that's a pretty strong\nassociation. Again, I randomly sampled from\nthe data until I got a set that happened to\nlook pretty flat. And a false negative is\nconditional on not rejecting the null. You\ncan only get a false negative if you get a\nnegative, you say there's nothing there. It's\nalso called a Type II error and this is a\nvalue that you have to calculate based on\nseveral elements of your testing framework,\nso it's something to be thoughtful of. Now,\nI do have to mention one thing, big security\nnotice, but wait. The problem with Hypothesis\nTesting; there's a few. #1, it's really easy\nto misinterpret it. A lot of people say, well\nif you get a statistically significant result,\nit means that it's something big and meaningful.\nAnd that's not true because it's confounded\nwith sample size and a lot of other things\nthat don't really matter. Also, a lot of other\npeople take exception with the assumption\nof a null effect or even a nil effect, that\nthere's zero difference at all. And that can\nbe, in certain situations can be an absurd\nclaim, so you've got to watch out for that.\nThere's also bias from the use of cutoff.\nAnytime you have a cut off, you're going to\nhave problems where you have cases that would\nhave been slightly higher, slightly lower.\nIt would have switched on the dichotomous\noutcome, so that is a problem. And then a\nlot of people say, it just answers the wrong\nquestion, because \"What it's telling you is\nwhat's the probability of getting this data\nat random?\" That's not what most people care\nabout. They want it the other way, which is\nwhy I mentioned previously Bayes theorem and\nI'll say more about that later. That being\nsaid, Hypothesis Testing is still very deeply\ningrained, very useful in a lot of questions\nand has gotten us really far in a lot of domains.\nSo in sum, let me say this. Hypothesis Testing\nis very common for yes/no outcomes and is\nthe default in many fields. And I argue it\nis still useful and information despite many\nof the well substantiated critiques. We'll\ncontinue in \"Statistics and Inference\" by\ndiscussing Estimation. Now as opposed to Hypothesis\nTesting, Estimation is designed to actually\ngive you a number, give you a value. Not just\na yes/no, go/no go, but give you an estimate\nfor a parameter that you're trying to get.\nI like to think of it sort of as a new angle,\nlooking at something from a different way.\nAnd the most common, approach to this is Confidence\nIntervals. Now, the important thing to remember\nis that this is still an Inferential procedure.\nYou're still using sample data and trying\nto make conclusions about a larger group or\npopulation. The difference here, is instead\nof coming up with a yes/no, you'd instead\nfocus on likely values for the population\nvalue. Most versions of Estimation are closely\nrelated to Hypothesis Testing, sometimes seen\nas the flip side of the coin. And we'll see\nhow that works in later videos. Now, I like\nto think of this as an ability to estimate\nany sample statistic and there's a few different\nversions. We have Parametric versions of Estimation\nand Bootstrap versions, that's why I got the\nboots here. And that's where you just kind\nof randomly sample from the data, in an effort\nto get an idea of the variability. You can\nalso have central versus noncentral Confidence\nIntervals in the Estimation, but we are not\ngoing to deal with those. Now, there are three\ngeneral steps to this. First, you need to\nchoose a confidence level. Anywhere from say,\nwell you can't have a zero, it has to be more\nthan zero and it can't be 100%. Choose something\nin between, 95% is the most common. And what\nit does, is it gives you a range a high and\na low. And the higher your level of confidence\nthe more confident you want to be, the wider\nthe range is going to be between your high\nand your low estimates. Now, there's a fundamental\ntrade off in what' happening here and the\ntrade off between accuracy; which means you're\non target or more specifically that your interval\ncontains the true population value. And the\nidea is that leads you to the correct Inference.\nThere's a tradeoff between accuracy and what's\ncalled Precision in this context. And precision\nmeans a narrow interval, as a small range\nof likely values. And what's important to\nemphasize is this is independent of accuracy,\nyou can have one without the other! Or neither\nor both. In fact, let me show you how this\nworks. What I have here is a little hypothetical\nsituation, I've got a variable that goes from\n10 to 90, and I've drawn a thick black line\nat 50. If you think of this in terms of percentages\nand political polls, it makes a very big difference\nif you're on the left or the right of 50%.\nAnd then I've drawn a dotted vertical line\nat 55 to say that that's our theoretical true\npopulation value. And what I have here is\na distribution that shows possible values\nbased on our sample data. And what you get\nhere is it's not accurate, because it's centered\non the wrong thing. It's actually centered\non 45 as opposed to 55. And it's not precise,\nbecause it's spread way out from may be 10\nto almost 80. So, this situation the data\nis no help really at all. Now, here's another\none. This is accurate because it's centered\non the true value. That's nice, but it's still\nreally spread out and you see that about 40%\nof the values are going to be on the other\nside of 50%; might lead you to reach the wrong\nconclusion. That's a problem! Now, here's\nthe nightmare situation. This is when you\nhave a very very precise estimate, but it's\nnot accurate; it's wrong. And this leads you\nto a very false sense of security and understanding\nof what's going on and you're going to totally\nblow it all the time. The ideal situation\nis this: you have an accurate estimate where\nthe distribution of sample values is really\nclose to the true population value and it's\nprecise, it's really tightly knit and you\ncan see that about 95% of it is on the correct\nside of 50 and that's good. If you want to\nsee all four of them here at once, we have\nthe precise two on the bottom, the imprecise\nones on the top, the accurate ones on the\nright, the inaccurate ones on the left. And\nso that's a way of comparing it. But, no matter\nwhat you do, you have to interpret confidence\ninterval. Now, the statistically accurate\nway that has very little interpretation is\nthis: you would say the 95% confidence interval\nfor the mean is 5.8 to 7.2. Okay, so that's\njust kind of taking the output from your computer\nand sticking it to sentence form. The Colloquial\nInterpretation of this goes like this: there\nis a 95% chance that the population mean is\nbetween 5.8 and 7.2. Well, in most statistical\nprocedures, specifically frequentist as opposed\nto bayesian you can't do that. That implies\nthe population mean shifts, that's not usually\nhow people see it. Instead, a better interpretation\nis this; 95% of confidence intervals for randomly\nselected samples will contain the population\nmean. Now, I can show you this really easily,\nwith a little demonstration. This is where\nI randomly generated data from a population\nwith a mean of 55 and I got 20 different samples.\nAnd I got the Confidence Interval from each\nsample and I charted the high and the low.\nAnd the question is, did it include the true\npopulation value. And you can see of these\n20, 19 included it, some of them barely made\nit. If you look at sample #1 on the far left;\nbarely made it. Sample #8, it doesn't look\nlike it made it, sample 20 on the far right,\nbarely made it on the other end. Only one\nmissed it completely, that sample #2, which\nis shown in red on the left. Now, it's not\nalways just one out of twenty, I actually\nhad to run this simulation about 8 times,\nbecause it gave me either zero or 3, or 1\nor two, and I had to run it until I got exactly\nwhat I was looking for here,. But this is\nwhat you would expect on average. So, let's\nsay a few things about this. There are somethings\nthat affect the width of a Confidence Interval.\nThe first is the confidence level, or CL.\nHigher confidence levels create wider intervals.\nThe more certain you have to be, you're going\nto give a bigger range to cover your basis.\nSecond, the Standard Deviation or larger standard\ndeviations create wider intervals. If the\nthing that you are studying is inherently\nreally variable, then of course you're estimate\nof the range is going to be more variable\nas well. And then finally there is the n or\nthe sample size. This one goes the other way.\nLarger sample sizes create narrower intervals.\nThe more observations you have, the more precise\nand the more reliable things tend to be. I\ncan show you each of these things graphically.\nHere we have a bunch of Confidence Intervals,\nwhere I am simply changing the confidence\nlevel from .50 at the low left side to .999\nand as you can see, it gets much bigger as\nwe increase. Next one is Standard Deviation.\nAs the sample standard deviation increases\nfrom 1 to 16, you can see that the interval\ngets a lot bigger. And then we have sample\nsize going from just 2 up to 512; I'm doubling\nit at each point. And you can see how the\ninterval gets more and more and more precise\nas we go through. And so, let's say this to\nsum up our discussion of estimation. Confidence\nIntervals which are the most common version\nof Estimation focus on the population parameter.\nAnd the variation in the data is explicitly\nincluded in that Estimation. Also, you can\nargue that they are more informative, because\nnot only do they tell you whether the population\nvalue is likely, but they give you a sense\nof the variability of the data itself, and\nthat's one reason why people will argue that\nconfidence levels should always be included\nin any statistical analysis. As we continue\nour discussion on \"Statistics and Data Science\",\nwe need to talk about some of the choices\nyou have to make, some of the tradeoffs and\nsome of the effects that these things have.\nWe'll begin by talking about Estimators, that\nis different methods for estimating parameters.\nI like to think of it as this, \"What kind\nof measuring stick or standard are you going\nto be using?\" Now, we'll begin with the most\ncommon. This is called OLS, which is actually\nshort for Ordinary Least Squares. This is\na very common approach, it's used in a lot\nof statistics and is based on what is called\nthe sum of squared errors, and it's characterized\nby an acronym called BLUE, which stands for\nBest Linear Unbiased Estimator. Let me show\nyou how that works. Let's take a scatterplot\nhere of an association between two variables.\nThis is actually the speed of a car and the\ndistance to stop from about the ‘20's I\nthink. We have a scatterplot and we can draw\na straight regression line right through it.\nNow, the line I've used is in fact the Best\nLinear Unbiased Estimate, but the way that\nyou can tell that is by getting what are called\nthe Residuals. If you take each data point\nand draw a perfectly vertical line up or down\nto the regression line, because the regression\nline predicts what the value would be for\nthat value on the X axis. Those are the residuals.\nEach of those individual, vertical lines is\nResidual. You square those and you add them\nup and this regression line, the gray angled\nline here will have the smallest sum of the\nsquared residuals of any possible straight\nline you can run through it. Now, another\napproach is ML, which stands for Maximum Likelihood.\nAnd this is when you choose parameters that\nmake the observed data most likely. It sounds\nkind of weird, but I can demonstrate it, and\nit's based on a kind of local search. It doesn't\nalways find the best, I like to think of it\nhere like the person here with a pair of binoculars,\nlooking around them, trying hard to find something,\nbut you could theoretically miss something.\nLet me give a very simple example of how this\nworks. Let's assume that we're trying to find\nparameters that maximize the likelihood of\nthis dotted vertical line here at 55, and\nI've got three possibilities. I've got my\nred distribution which is off to the left,\nblue which is a little more centered and green\nwhich is far to the right. And these are all\nidentical, except they have different means,\nand by changing the means, you see there the\none that is highest where the dotted line\nis the blue one. And so, if the only thing\nwe are doing is changing the mean, and we\nare looking at these three distributions,\nthen the blue one is the one that has the\nmaximum likelihood for this particular parameter.\nOn the other hand, we could give them all\nthe same meaning right around 50, and vary\ntheir standard deviations instead and so they\nspread out different amounts. In this case,\nthe red distribution is highest at the dotted\nvertical line and so it has the maximum value.\nOr if you want to, you can vary both the mean\nand the standard deviations simultaneously.\nAnd here green gets the slight advantage.\nNow this is really a caricature of the process\nbecause obviously you would just want to center\nit on the 55 and be done with it. The question\nis when you have many variables in your dataset.\nThen it's a very complex process of choosing\nvalues that can maximize the association between\nall of them. But you get a feel for how it\nworks with this. The third approach which\nis pretty common is MAP or map for Maximum\nA Posteriori. This is a Bayesian approach\nto parameter estimation, and what it does\nit adds the prior distribution and then it\ngoes through sort of an anchoring and adjusting\nprocess. What happens, by the way is stronger\nprior estimates exert more influence on the\nestimate and that might mean for example larger\nsample or more extreme values. And those have\na greater influence on the posterior estimate\nof the parameters. Now, what's interesting\nis that all three of these methods all connect\nwith each other. Let me show you exactly how\nthey connect. The ordinary least squares,\nOLS, this is equivalent to maximum likelihood,\nwhen it has normally distributed error terms.\nAnd maximum likelihood, ML is equivalent to\nMaximum A Posteriori or MAP, with a uniform\nprior distribution. You want to put it another\nway, ordinary least squares or OLS is a special\ncase of Maximum Likelihood. And then maximum\nlikelihood or ML, is a special case of Maximum\nA Posteriori, and just in case you like it,\nwe can put it into set notation. OLS is a\nsubset of ML is a subset of MAP, and so there\nare connections between these three methods\nof estimating population parameters. Let me\njust sum it up briefly this way. The standards\nthat you use OLS, ML, MAP they affect your\nchoices and they determine which parameters\nbest estimate what's happening in your data.\nSeveral methods exist and there's obviously\nmore than what I showed you right here, but\nmany are closely related and under certain\ncircumstances they're all identical. And so\nit comes down to exactly what are your purposes\nand what do you think is going to work best\nwith the data that you have to give you the\ninsight that you need in your own project.\nThe next step we want to consider in our \"Statistics\nand Data Science\", are choices that we have\nto make. Has to do with Measures of fit or\nthe correspondence between the data that we\nhave and the model that you create. Now, turns\nout there are a lot of different ways to measure\nthis and one big question is how close is\nclose enough or how can you see the difference\nbetween the model and reality. Well, there's\na few really common approaches to this. The\nfirst one has what's called R2. That's kind\nof the longer name, that's the coefficient\nof determination. There's a variation; adjusted\nR2, which takes into consideration the number\nof variables. Then there's minus 2LL, which\nis based on the likelihood ratio and a couple\nof variations. The Akaike Information Criterion\nor AIC and the Bayesian Information Criterion\nor BIC. Then there's also Chi-Squared, it's\nactually a Greek c, it looks like a x, but\nit's actually c and it's chi-squared. And\nso let's talk about each of these in turn.\nFirst off is R2, this is the squared multiple\ncorrelation or the coefficient of determination.\nAnd what it does is it compares the variance\nof Y, so if you have an outcome variable,\nit looks like the total variance of that and\ncompares it to the residuals on Y after you've\nmade your prediction. The scores on squared\nrange from 0 to 1 and higher is better. The\nnext is -2 Log-likelihood that's the likelihood\nratio or like I just said the -2 log likelihood.\nAnd what this does is compares the fit of\nnested models, we have a subset then a larger\nset, than the larger set overall. This approach\nis used a lot in logistic regression when\nyou have a binary outcome. And in general,\nsmaller values are considered better fit.\nNow, as I mentioned there are some variations\nof this. I like to think of variations of\nchocolate. The -2 log likelihood there's the\nAkaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the\nBayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and what\nboth of these do, they adjust for the number\nof predictors. Because obviously you're going\nto have a huge number of predictors, you're\ngoing to get a really good fit. But you're\nprobably going to have what is called overfitting,\nwhere your model is tailored to specifically\nto the data you currently have and that doesn't\ngeneralize well. These both attempt to reduce\nthe effect of overfitting. Then there's chi-squared\nagain. It's actually a lower case Greek c,\nlooks like an x and chi-squared is used for\nexamining the deviations between two datasets.\nSpecifically between the observed dataset\nand the expected values or the model you create,\nwe expect this many frequencies in each category.\nNow, I'll just mention when I go into the\nstore there's a lot of other choices, but\nthese are some of the most common standards,\nparticularly the R2. And I just want to say,\nin sum, there are many different ways to assess\nthe fit that corresponds between a model and\nyour data. And the choices effect the model,\nyou know especially are you getting penalized\nfor throwing in too many variables relative\nto your number of cases? Are you dealing with\na quantitative or binary outcome? Those things\nall matter, and so the most important thing\nas always, my standing advice is keep your\ngoals in mind and choose a method that seems\nto fit best with your analytical strategy\nand the insight you're trying to get from\nyour data. The \"Statistics and Data Science\"\noffers a lot of different choices. One of\nthe most important is going to be feature\nselection, or the choice of variables to include\nin your model. It's sort of like confronting\nthis enormous range of information and trying\nto choose what matters most. Trying to get\nthe needle out of the haystack. The goal of\nfeature selection is to select the best features\nor variables and get rid of uninformative/noisy\nvariables and simplify the statistical model\nthat you are creating because that helps avoid\noverfitting or getting a model that works\ntoo well with the current data and works less\nwell with other data. The major problem here\nis Multicollinearity, a very long word. That\nhas to do with the relationship between the\npredictors and the model. I'm going to show\nit to you graphically here. Imagine here for\ninstance, we've got a big circle here to represent\nthe variability in our outcome variable; we're\ntrying to predict it. And we've got a few\npredictors. So we've got Predictor # 1 over\nhere and you see it's got a lot of overlap,\nthat's nice. Then we've got predictor #2 here,\nit also has some overlap with the outcome,\nbut it's also overlaps with Predictor 1. And\nthen finally down here, we've got Predictor\n3, which overlaps with both of them. And the\nproblem rises the overlap between the predictors\nand the outcome variable. Now, there's a few\nways of dealing with this, some of these are\npretty common. So for instance, there's the\npractice of looking at probability values\nand regression equations, there's standardized\ncoefficients and there's variations on sequential\nregression. There are also, there's newer\nprocedures for dealing with the disentanglement\nof the association between the predictors.\nThere's something called Commonality analysis,\nthere's Dominance Analysis, and there are\nRelative Importance Weights. Of course there\nare many other choices in both the common\nand the newer, but these are just a few that\nare worth taking a special look at. First,\nis P values or probability values. This is\nthe simplest method, because most statistical\npackages will calculate probability values\nfor each predictor and they will put little\nasterisks next to it. And so what you're doing\nis you're looking at the p-values; the probabilities\nfor each predictor or more often the asterisks\nnext to it, which sometimes give it the name\nof Star Search. You're just kind of cruising\nthrough a large output of data, just looking\nfor the stars or asterisks. This is fundamentally\na problematic approach for a lot of reasons.\nThe problem here, is your looking individually\nand it inflates false positives. Say you have\n20 variables. Each is entered and tested with\nan alpha or a false positive of 5%. You end\nup with nearly a 65% chance of a least one\nfalse positive in there. That's distorted\nby sample size, because with a large enough\nsample anything can become statistically significant.\nAnd so, relying on p-values can be a seriously\nproblematic approach. Slightly better approach\nis to use Betas or Standardized regression\ncoefficients and this is where you put all\nthe variables on the same scale. So, usually\nstandardized from zero and then to either\nminus 1/plus 1 or with a standardized deviation\nof 1. The trick is though, they're still in\nthe context of each other and you can't really\nseparate them because those coefficients are\nonly valid when you take that group of predictors\nas a whole. So, one way to try and get around\nthat is to do what they call stepwise procedures.\nWhere you look at the variables in sequence,\nthere's several versions of sequential regression\nthat'll allow you to do that. You can put\nthe variables into groups or blocks and enter\nthem in blocks and look at how the equation\nchanges overall. You can examine the change\nin fit in each step. The problem with a stepwise\nprocedure like this, is it dramatically increases\nthe risk of overfitting which again is a bad\nthing if you want to generalize your data.\nAnd so, to deal with this, there is a whole\ncollection of newer methods, a few of them\ninclude commonality analysis, which provides\nseparate estimates for the unique and shared\ncontributions of each variable. Well, that's\na neat statistical trick but the problem is,\nit just moves the problem of disentanglement\nto the analyst, so you're really not better\noff then you were as far as I can tell. There's\ndominance analysis, which compares every possible\nsubset of Predictors. Again, sounds really\ngood, but you have the problem known as the\ncombinatorial explosion. If you have 50 variables\nthat you could use, and there are some that\nhave millions of variables, with 50 variables,\nyou have over 1 quadrillion possible combinations,\nyou're not going to finish that in your lifetime.\nAnd it's also really hard to get things like\nstandard errors and perform inferential statistics\nwith this kind of model. Then there's also\nsomething that's even more recent than these\nothers and that's called relative importance\nweights. And what that does is creates a set\nof orthogonal predictors or uncorrelated with\neach other, basing them off of the originals\nand then it predicts the scores and then it\ncan predict the outcome without the multicollinear\nbecause these new predictors are uncorrelated.\nIt then rescales the coefficients back to\nthe original variables, that's the back-transform.\nThen from that it assigns relative importance\nor a percentage of explanatory power to each\npredictor variable. Now, despite this very\ndifferent approach, it tends to have results\nthat resemble dominance analysis. It's actually\nreally easy to do with a website, you just\nplug in your information and it does it for\nyou. And so that is yet another way of dealing\nwith a problem multicollinearity and trying\nto disentangle the contribution of different\nvariables. In sum, let's say this. What you're\ntrying to do here, is trying to choose the\nmost useful variables to include into your\nmodel. Make it simpler, be parsimonious. Also,\nreduce the noise and distractions in your\ndata. And in doing so, you're always going\nto have to confront the ever present problem\nof multicollinearity, or the association between\nthe predictors in your model with several\ndifferent ways of dealing with that. The next\nstep in our discussion of \"Statistics and\nthe Choices you have to Make\", concerns common\nproblems in modeling. And I like to think\nof this is the situation where you're up against\nthe rock and the hard place and this is where\nthe going gets very hard. Common problems\ninclude things like Non-Normality, Non-Linearity,\nMulticollinearity and Missing Data. And I'll\ntalk about each of these. Let's begin with\nNon-Normality. Most statistical procedures\nlike to deal with nice symmetrical, unimodal\nbell curves, they make life really easy. But\nsometimes you get really skewed distribution\nor you get outliers. Skews and outliers, while\nthey happen pretty often, they're a problem\nbecause they distort measures like the mean\ngets thrown off tremendously when they have\noutliers. And they throw off models because\nthey assume the symmetry and the unimodal\nnature of a normal distribution. Now, one\nway of dealing with this as I've mentioned\nbefore is to try transforming the data, taking\nthe logarithm, try something else. But another\nproblem may be that you have mixed distributions,\nif you have a bimodal distribution, maybe\nwhat you really have here is two distributions\nthat got mixed together and you may need to\ndisentangle them through exploring your data\na little bit more. Next is Non-Linearity.\nThe gray line here is the regression line,\nwe like to put straight lines through things\nbecause it makes the description a lot easier.\nBut sometimes the data is curved and this\nis you have a perfect curved relationship\nhere, but a straight line doesn't work with\nthat. Linearity is a very common assumption\nof many procedures especially regression.\nTo deal with this, you can try transforming\none or both of the variables in the equation\nand sometimes that manages to straighten out\nthe relationship between the two of them.\nAlso, using Polynomials. Things that specifically\ninclude curvature like squares and cubed values,\nthat can help as well. Then there's the issues\nof multicollinearity, which I've mentioned\npreviously. This is when you have correlated\npredictors, or rather the predictors themselves\nare associated to each other. The problem\nis, this can distort the coefficients you\nget in the overall model. Some procedures,\nit turns out are less affected by this than\nothers, but one overall way of using this\nmight be to simply try and use fewer variables.\nIf they're really correlated maybe you don't\nneed all of them. And there are empirical\nways to deal with this, but truthfully, it's\nperfectly legitimate to use your own domain\nexpertise and your own insight to the problem.\nTo use your theory to choose among the variables\nthat would be the most informative. Part of\nthe problem we have here, is something called\nthe Combinatorial Explosion. This is where\ncombinations of variables or categories grow\ntoo fast for analysis. Now, I've mentioned\nsomething about this before. If you have 4\nvariables and each variable has two categories,\nthen you have 16 combinations, fine you can\ntry things 16 different ways. That's perfectly\ndoable. If you have 20 variables with five\ncategories; again that's not to unlikely,\nyou have 95 trillion combinations, that's\na whole other ball game, even with your fast\ncomputer. A couple of ways of dealing with\nthis, #1 is with theory. Use your theory and\nyour own understanding of the domain to choose\nthe variables or categories with the greatest\npotential to inform. You know what you're\ndealing with, rely on that information. Second\nis, there are data driven approaches. You\ncan use something called a Markov chain Monte\nCarlo model to explore the range of possibilities\nwithout having to explore the range of possibilities\nof each and every single one of your 95 trillion\ncombinations. Closely related to the combinatorial\nexplosion is the curse of dimensionality.\nThis is when you have phenomena, you're got\nthings that may only occur in higher dimensions\nor variable sets. Things that don't show up\nuntil you have these unusual combinations.\nThat may be true of a lot of how reality works,\nbut the project of analysis is simplification.\nAnd so you've got to try to do one or two\ndifferent things. You can try to reduce. Mostly\nthat means reducing the dimensionality of\nyour data. Reduce the number of dimensions\nor variables before you analyze. You're actually\ntrying to project the data onto a lower dimensional\nspace, the same way you try to get a shadow\nof a 3D object. There's a lot of different\nways to do that. There's also data driven\nmethods. And the same method here, a Markov\nchain Monte Carlo model, can be used to explore\na wide range of possibilities. Finally, there\nis the problem of Missing Data and this is\na big problem. Missing data tends to distort\nanalysis and creates bias if it's a particular\ngroup that's missing. And so when you're dealing\nwith this, what you have to do is actually\ncheck for patterns and missingness, you create\nnew variables that indicates whether or not\na variable is missing and then you see if\nthat is associated with any of your other\nvariables. If there's not strong patterns,\nthen you can impute missing values. You can\nput in the mean or the median, you can do\nRegression Imputation, something called Multiple\nImputation, a lot of different choices. And\nthose are all technical topics, which we will\nhave to talk about in a more technically oriented\nseries. But for right now, in terms of the\nproblems that can come up during modeling,\nI can summarize it this way. #1, check your\nassumptions at every step. Make sure that\nthe data have the distribution that you need,\ncheck for the effects of outliers, check for\nambiguity and bias. See if you can interpret\nwhat you have and use your analysis, use data\ndriven methods but also your knowledge of\nthe theory and the meaning of things in your\ndomain to inform your analysis and find ways\nof dealing with these problems. As we continue\nour discussion of \"Statistics and the Choices\nthat are Made\", one important consideration\nis Model Validation. And the idea here is\nthat as you are doing your analysis, are you\non target? More specifically, the model that\nyou create through regression or whatever\nyou do, your model fits the sample beautifully,\nyou've optimized it there. But, will it work\nwell with other data? Fundamentally, this\nis the question of Generalizability, also\nsometimes called Scalability. Because you\nare trying to apply in other situations, and\nyou don't want to get too specific or it won't\nwork in other situations. Now, there are a\nfew general ways of dealing with this and\ntrying to get some sort of generalizability.\n#1 is Bayes; a Bayesian approach. Then there's\nReplication. Then there's something called\nHoldout Validation, then there is Cross-Validation.\nI'll discuss each one of these very briefly\nin conceptual terms. The first one is Bayes\nand the idea here is you want to get what\nare called Posterior Probabilities. Most analyses\ngive you the probability value for the data\ngiven; the hypothesis, so you have to start\nwith an assumption about the hypothesis. But\ninstead, it's possible to flip that around\nby combining it with special kind of data\nto get the probability of the hypothesis given\nthe data. And that is the purpose of Bayes\ntheorem; which I've talked about elsewhere.\nAnother way of finding out how well things\nare going to work is through Replication.\nThat is, do the study again. It's considered\nthe gold standard in many different fields.\nThe question is whether you need an exact\nreplication or if a conceptual one that is\nsimilar in certain respects. You can argue\nfor both ways, but one thing you do want to\ndo is when you do a replication then you actually\nwant to combine the results. And what's interesting\nis the first study can serve as the Bayesian\nprior probability for the second study. So\nyou can actually use meta-analysis or Bayesian\nmethods for combining the data from the two\nof them. Then there's hold out validation.\nThis is where you build your statistical model\non one part of the data and you test it on\nthe other. I like to think of it as the eggs\nin separate baskets. The trick is that you\nneed a large sample in order to have enough\nto do these two steps separately. On the other\nhand, it's also used very often in data science\ncompetitions, as a way of having a sort of\ngold standard for assessing the validity of\na model. Finally, I'll mention just one more\nand that's Cross-Validation. Where you use\nthe same data for training and for testing\nor validating. There's several different versions\nof it, and the idea is that you're not using\nall the data at once, but you're kind of cycling\nthrough and weaving the results together.\nThere's Leave-one-out, where you leave out\none case at a time, also called LOO. There's\nLeave-p-out, where you leave out a certain\nnumber at each point. There's k-fold where\nyou split the data into say for instance 10\ngroups and you leave out one and you develop\nit on the other nine, then you cycle through.\nAnd there's repeated random subsampling, where\nyou use a random process at each point. Any\nof those can be used to develop the model\non one part of the data and tested on another\nand then cycle through to see how well it\nholds up on different circumstances. And so\nin sum, I can say this about validation. You\nwant to make your analysis count by testing\nhow well your model holds up from the data\nyou developed it on, to other situations.\nBecause that is what you are really trying\nto accomplish. This allows you to check the\nvalidity of your analysis and your reasoning\nand it allows you to build confidence in the\nutility of your results. To finish up our\ndiscussion of \"Statistics and Data Science\"\nand the choices that are involved, I want\nto mention something that really isn't a choice,\nbut more an attitude. And that's DIY, that's\nDo it yourself. The idea here is, you know\nreally you just need to get started. Remember\ndata is democratic. It's there for everyone,\neverybody has data. Everybody works with data\neither explicitly or implicitly. Data is democratic,\nso is Data Science. And really, my overall\nmessage is You can do it! You know, a lot\nof people think you have to be this cutting\nedge, virtual reality sort of thing. And it's\ntrue, there's a lot of active development\ngoing on in data science, there's always new\nstuff. The trick however is, the software\nyou can use to implement those things often\nlags. It'll show up first in programs like\nR and Python, but as far as it showing up\nin a point click program that could be years.\nWhat's funny though, is often these cutting\nedge developments don't really make much of\na difference in the results of the interpretation.\nThey may in certain edge cases, but usually\nnot a huge difference. So I'm just going to\nsay analyst beware. You don't have to necessarily\ndo it, it's pretty easy to do them wrong and\nso you don't have to wait for the cutting\nedge. Now, that being said, I do want you\nto pay attention to what you are doing. A\ncouple of things I have said repeatedly is\n\"Know your goal\". Why are you doing this study?\nWhy are you analyzing the data, what are you\nhoping to get out of it? Try to match your\nmethods to your goal, be goal directed. Focus\non the usability; will you get something out\nof this that people can actually do something\nwith. Then, as I've mentioned with that Bayesian\nthing, don't get confused with probabilities.\nRemember that priors and posteriors are different\nthings just so you can interpret things accurately.\nNow, I want to mention something that's really\nimportant to me personally. And that is, beware\nthe trolls. You will encounter critics, people\nwho are very vocal and who can be harsh and\ngrumpy and really just intimidating. And they\ncan really make you feel like you shouldn't\ndo stuff because you're going to do it wrong.\nBut the important thing to remember is that\nthe critics can be wrong. Yes, you'll make\nmistakes, everybody does. You know, I can't\ntell you how many times I have to write my\ncode more than once to get it to do what I\nwant it to do. But in analysis, nothing is\ncompletely wasted if you pay close attention.\nI've mentioned this before, everything signifies.\nOr in other words, everything has meaning.\nThe trick is that meaning might not be what\nyou expected it to be. So you're going to\nhave to listen carefully and I just want to\nreemphasize, all data has value. So make sure\nyour listening carefully. In sum, let's say\nthis: no analysis is perfect. The real questions\nis not is your analysis perfect, but can you\nadd value? And I'm sure that you can. And\nfundamentally, data is democratic. So, I'm\ngoing to finish with one more picture here\nand that is just jump write in and get started.\nYou'll be glad you did. To wrap up our course\n\"Statistics and Data Science\", I want to give\nyou a short conclusion and some next steps.\nMostly I want to give a little piece of advice\nI learned from a professional saxophonist,\nKirk Whalum. And he says there's \"There's\nAlways Something To Work On\", there's always\nsomething you can do to try things differently\nto get better. It works when practicing music,\nit also works when you're dealing with data.\nNow, there are additional courses, here at\ndatalabb.cc that you might want to look at.\nThey are conceptual courses, additional high-level\noverviews on things like machine learning,\ndata visualization and other topics. And I\nencourage you to take a look at those as well,\nto round out your general understanding of\nthe field. There are also however, many practical\ncourses. These are hands on tutorials on these\nstatistical procedures I've covered and you\nlearn how to do them in R, Python and SPSS\nand other programs. But whatever you're doing,\nkeep this other little piece of advice from\nwriters in mind, and that is \"Write what you\nknow\". And I'm going to say it this way. Explore\nand analyze and delve into what you know.\nRemember when we talked about data science\nand the Venn Diagram, we've talked about the\ncoding and the stats. But don't forget this\npart on the bottom. Domain expertise is just\nas important to good data science as the ability\nto work with computer coding and the ability\nto work with the numbers and quantitative\nskills. But also, remember this. You don't\nhave to know everything, your work doesn't\nhave to be perfect. The most important thing\nis just get started, you'll be glad you did.\nThanks for joining me and good luck!\n",
