  "text": "foreign\nwe're going to discuss transfer learning\nlet's Dive Right In first what is the\ndefinition of transfer learning and what\ndoes this actually mean\nthe formal definition is\na transfer learning is the Improvement\nof learning in a new task through the\ntransfer of Knowledge from a related\ntask that has already been learned okay\nnow what does that actually mean\nyourself as a child learning to ride a\nbicycle for the first time is difficult\nand took lots of time to learn you need\nto learn everything from scratch how to\nkeep the balance how to steer the wheel\nhow to break now imagine yourself today\nwanting to learn how to ride a\nmotorcycle you don't need to start from\nzero it is much easier for you to learn\nhow to keep your balance or use the\nbrakes even though you're in a different\nsetting you can transfer the skills\nlearned from riding a bicycle that is\nthe essence of transfer learning okay so\nin a machine learning context and not a\nlearning to ride a bike context what\ndoes this look like transfer learning is\na technique that enables algorithms to\nlearn a new task by using pre-trained\nmodels take an algorithm that has\nlearned how to recognize dogs\nthis algorithm can be trying to\nrecognize cats with relativities by\ntransferring certain abstract Concepts\nbefore transfer learning traditional\nlearning meant that machines learned in\nisolation once the machine was given a\nlarge enough data set it learned how to\nperform a specific task however one task\nwith a new problem to solve it cannot\nresort to any previously gained\nknowledge instead a conventional\nalgorithm needs a second data set to\nbegin a new learning process however in\ntransfer learning the learning of new\ntasks relies on previously learned tasks\nthe algorithm can store and access this\nknowledge the module is General instead\nof specific why is this beneficial this\ntechnique of transfer learning unlocks\ntwo major benefits first transfer\nlearning increases learning speed with\nless new things to learn the algorithm\nis faster to generate high quality\noutput\nto use another analogy a nice hockey\nplayer is likely to learn more quickly\nto play field hockey than an average\nperson because certain Concepts apply to\nboth disciplines\nsecond transfer learning reduces the\namount of data required in additional\nlearning an algorithm can only learn\nwhen fed with enough training data\nsometimes millions of data points this\ndata might not be available at all or\ntoo expensive to generate and prepare\nfor the model so there you have it\ntransfer learning is how machines learn\nby sharing knowledge now that you're\nhere I wanted to tell you about levity\nlevity is a tool that allows you to\ntrain AI models on images documents and\nText data you can rebuild manual\nworkflows and connect everything to your\nexisting systems without writing a\nsingle line of code if you liked this\nvideo you'll probably love levity and we\ncan't wait to hear from you\nforeign\n[Music]\n",
