  "text": "So anyone who's been paying attention\nfor the last few months\nhas been seeing headlines like this,\nespecially in education.\nThe thesis has been:\nstudents are going to be using ChatGPT\nand other forms of AI\nto cheat, do their assignments.\nThey’re not going to learn.\nAnd it’s going to completely undermine\neducation as we know it.\nNow, what I'm going to argue today\nis not only are there ways\nto mitigate all of that,\nif we put the right guardrails,\nwe do the right things,\nwe can mitigate it.\nBut I think we're at the cusp of using AI\nfor probably the biggest\npositive transformation\nthat education has ever seen.\nAnd the way we're going to do that\nis by giving every student on the planet\nan artificially intelligent\nbut amazing personal tutor.\nAnd we're going to give every teacher\non the planet an amazing,\nartificially intelligent\nteaching assistant.\nAnd just to appreciate\nhow big of a deal it would be\nto give everyone a personal tutor,\nI show you this clip\nfrom Benjamin Bloom’s 1984\n2 sigma study,\nor he called it the “2 sigma problem.”\nThe 2 sigma comes\nfrom two standard deviation,\nsigma, the symbol for standard deviation.\nAnd he had good data that showed\nthat look, a normal distribution,\nthat's the one that you see\nin the traditional bell curve\nright in the middle, that's how the world\nkind of sorts itself out,\nthat if you were to give personal\n1-to-1 to tutoring for students,\nthen you could actually get a distribution\nthat looks like that right.\nIt says tutorial 1-to-1\nwith the asterisks,\nlike, that right distribution,\na two standard-deviation improvement.\nJust to put that in plain language,\nthat could take your average student\nand turn them into an exceptional student.\nIt can take your below-average student\nand turn them into\nan above-average student.\nNow the reason why he framed it\nas a problem, was he said,\nwell, this is all good,\nbut how do you actually scale\ngroup instruction this way?\nHow do you actually give it\nto everyone in an economic way?\nWhat I'm about to show you is I think\nthe first moves towards doing that.\nObviously, we've been trying\nto approximate it in some way\nat Khan Academy for over a decade now,\nbut I think we're at the cusp\nof accelerating it dramatically.\nI'm going to show you\nthe early stages of what our AI,\nwhich we call Khanmigo,\nwhat it can now do\nand maybe a little bit\nof where it is actually going.\nSo this right over here\nis a traditional exercise\nthat you or many of your children\nmight have seen on Khan Academy.\nBut what's new is that little\nbot thing at the right.\nAnd we'll start by seeing one\nof the very important safeguards,\nwhich is the conversation is recorded\nand viewable by your teacher.\nIt’s moderated actually by a second AI.\nAnd also it does not tell you the answer.\nIt is not a cheating tool.\nWhen the student says,\n\"Tell me the answer,\"\nit says, \"I'm your tutor.\nWhat do you think is the next step\nfor solving the problem?\"\nNow, if the student makes a mistake,\nand this will surprise people\nwho think large language models\nare not good at mathematics,\nnotice, not only does it\nnotice the mistake,\nit asks the student to explain\ntheir reasoning,\nbut it's actually doing what I would say,\nnot just even an average tutor would do,\nbut an excellent tutor would do.\nIt’s able to divine what is probably\nthe misconception in that student’s mind,\nthat they probably didn’t use\nthe distributive property.\nRemember, we need to distribute\nthe negative two\nto both the nine and the 2m\ninside of the parentheses.\nThis to me is a very, very, very big deal.\nAnd it's not just in math.\nThis is a computer programming\nexercise on Khan Academy,\nwhere the student needs\nto make the clouds part.\nAnd so we can see the student starts\ndefining a variable, left X minus minus.\nIt only made the left cloud part.\nBut then they can ask Khanmigo,\nwhat’s going on?\nWhy is only the left cloud moving?\nAnd it understands the code.\nIt knows all the context\nof what the student is doing,\nand it understands that those ellipses\nare there to draw clouds,\nwhich I think is kind of mind-blowing.\nAnd it says, \"To make the right\ncloud move as well,\ntry adding a line of code\ninside the draw function\nthat increments the right X variable\nby one pixel in each frame.\"\nNow, this one is maybe even more amazing\nbecause we have a lot of math teachers.\nWe've all been trying to teach\nthe world to code,\nbut there aren't a lot of computing\nteachers out there.\nAnd what you just saw,\neven when I'm tutoring my kids,\nwhen they're learning to code,\nI can't help them this well, this fast,\nthis is really going to be a super tutor.\nAnd it's not just exercises.\nIt understands what you're watching.\nIt understands the context of your video.\nIt can answer the age-old question,\n“Why do I need to learn this?”\nAnd it asks Socratically,\n\"Well, what do you care about?\"\nAnd let's say the student says,\n\"I want to be a professional athlete.\"\nAnd it says, \"Well, learning\nabout the size of cells,\nwhich is what this video is,\nthat could be really useful\nfor understanding nutrition\nand how your body works, etc.\"\nIt can answer questions, it can quiz you,\nit can connect it to other ideas,\nyou can now ask\nas many questions of a video\nas you could ever dream of.\n(Applause)\nAnother big shortage out there,\nI remember the high school I went to,\nthe student-to-guidance counselor ratio\nwas about 200 or 300 to one.\nA lot of the country,\nit's worse than that.\nWe can use Khanmigo to give\nevery student a guidance counselor,\nacademic coach, career coach, life coach,\nwhich is exactly\nwhat you see right over here.\nAnd we launched this\nwith the GPT-4 launch.\nWe have a few thousand people on this.\nThis isn't a fake demo,\nthis is really it in action.\nAnd then there is, you know,\nthings that I think it would\nhave been even harder,\nit would have been a little\nscience fiction to do\nwith even a traditional tutor.\nWe run an online high school\nwith Arizona State University\ncalled Khan World School,\nand we have a student who attends\nthat online school, based in India.\nHer name's Saanvi.\nAnd she was doing a report\non \"The Great Gatsby.\"\nAnd when she was reading\n\"The Great Gatsby,\"\nJay Gatsby keeps looking\nat the green light off into the distance.\nAnd she's like, \"Why does he do that?\"\nShe did some web searches,\nand people have obviously studied this\nand commented about the symbolism of that,\nbut none of it was really\nresonating with her.\nAnd then she realized\nthat she had Khanmigo\nand that she could talk\nto Jay Gatsby himself.\nAnd so, \"Ah, splendid choice, old sport.\nI am now Jay Gatsby,\nthe enigmatic millionaire\nfrom F. Scott Fitzgerald’s classic.”\nAnd so, \"Why do you keep staring\nat the green light?\"\n\"Ah, the green light, old sport.\nIt's a symbol of my dreams\nand desires, you see.\nIt's situated at the end\nof Daisy Buchanan's dock\nacross the bay from my mansion.\nI gaze at it longingly\nas it represents my yearning for the past\nand my hope to reunite with Daisy,\nthe love of my life.\"\nAnd what was cool is, Saanvi then said,\n“I had this long conversation,”\nshe called him “Mr. Gatsby,”\nand at the end she actually apologized\nfor taking his time,\nwhich I thought was very polite of her.\nBut you can imagine this unlocks\nlearning literature, learning ...\nYou could talk to historical figures.\nWe're even probably\ngoing to add an activity\nyou can talk to like,\nthe Mississippi River.\nIt brings things to life in ways\nthat really were science fiction\neven six months or a year ago.\nStudents can get into debates with the AI.\nAnd we’ve got this here\nis the student debating\nwhether we should cancel student debt.\nThe student is against\ncanceling student debt,\nand we've gotten very clear feedback.\nWe started running it at Khan World School\nin our lab school that we have,\nKhan Lab School.\nThe students, the high school\nstudents especially,\nthey're saying \"This is amazing to be able\nto fine-tune my arguments\nwithout fearing judgment.\nIt makes me that much more confident\nto go into the classroom\nand really participate.\"\nAnd we all know that Socratic dialogue\ndebate is a great way to learn,\nbut frankly, it's not out there\nfor most students.\nBut now it can be accessible\nto hopefully everyone.\nA lot of the narrative,\nwe saw that in the headlines, has been,\n\"It's going to do the writing for kids.\nKids are not going to learn to write.\"\nBut we are showing that there's ways\nthat the AI doesn't write for you,\nit writes with you.\nSo this is a little thing,\nand my eight year old is addicted to this,\nand he's not a kid\nthat really liked writing before,\nbut you can say,\n“I want to write a horror story,”\nand it says, \"Ooh, a horror story,\nhow spine-tingling and thrilling.\nLet's dive into the world of eerie shadows\nand chilling mysteries.\"\nAnd this is an activity where\nthe student will write two sentences,\nand then the AI will write two sentences.\nAnd so they collaborate\ntogether on a story.\nThe student writes,\n\"Beatrice was a misunderstood ghost.\nShe wanted to make friends\nbut kept scaring them by accident.\"\nAnd the AI says, \"Poor Beatrice, a lonely\nspirit yearning for companionship.\nOne day she stumbled\nupon an old abandoned mansion,\" etc.\nI encourage you all\nto hopefully one day try this.\nThis is surprisingly fun.\nNow to even more directly\nhit this use case.\nAnd what I'm about to show you,\neverything I showed you so far\nis actually already part of Khanmigo,\nand what I’m about to show you,\nwe haven't shown to anyone yet,\nthis is a prototype.\nWe hope to be able to launch it\nin the next few months,\nbut this is to directly use AI,\nuse generative AI,\nto not undermine English\nand language arts\nbut to actually enhance it in ways\nthat we couldn't have even\nconceived of even a year ago.\nThis is reading comprehension.\nThe students reading Steve Jobs's\nfamous speech at Stanford.\nAnd then as they get to certain points,\nthey can click on that little question.\nAnd the AI will then Socratically,\nalmost like an oral exam,\nask the student about things.\nAnd the AI can highlight\nparts of the passage.\nWhy did the author use that word?\nWhat was their intent?\nDoes it back up their argument?\nThey can start to do stuff\nthat once again,\nwe never had the capability\nto give everyone a tutor,\neveryone a writing coach to actually\ndig in to reading at this level.\nAnd you could go on the other side of it.\nAnd we have whole work flows\nthat helps them write,\nhelps them be a writing coach,\ndraw an outline.\nBut once a student actually\nconstructs a draft,\nand this is where\nthey're constructing a draft,\nthey can ask for feedback once again,\nas you would expect\nfrom a good writing coach.\nIn this case, the student\nwill say, let's say,\n\"Does my evidence support my claim?\"\nAnd then the AI, not only\nis able to give feedback,\nbut it's able to highlight certain parts\nof the passage and says,\n\"On this passage, this doesn't\nquite support your claim,\"\nbut once again, Socratically says,\n\"Can you tell us why?\"\nSo it's pulling the student,\nmaking them a better writer,\ngiving them far more feedback\nthan they've ever been able\nto actually get before.\nAnd we think this is going to dramatically\naccelerate writing, not hurt it.\nNow, everything I've talked\nabout so far is for the student.\nBut we think this could be equally\nas powerful for the teacher\nto drive more personalized\neducation and frankly\nsave time and energy for themselves\nand for their students.\nSo this is an American history\nexercise on Khan Academy.\nIt's a question\nabout the Spanish-American War.\nAnd at first it's in student mode.\nAnd if you say, “Tell me the answer,”\nit’s not going to tell the answer.\nIt's going to go into tutoring mode.\nBut that little toggle\nwhich teachers have access to,\nthey can turn student mode off\nand then it goes into teacher mode.\nAnd what this does is it turns into --\nYou could view it\nas a teacher's guide on steroids.\nNot only can it explain the answer,\nit can explain how you might\nwant to teach it.\nIt can help prepare\nthe teacher for that material.\nIt can help them create lesson plans,\nas you could see doing right there.\nIt'll eventually help them\ncreate progress reports\nand help them, eventually, grade.\nSo once again, teachers spend\nabout half their time\nwith this type of activity,\nlesson planning.\nAll of that energy can go back to them\nor go back to human interactions\nwith their actual students.\n(Applause)\nSo, you know, one point I want to make.\nThese large language models\nare so powerful,\nthere's a temptation to say like, well,\nall these people are just going\nto slap them onto their websites,\nand it kind of turns the applications\nthemselves into commodities.\nAnd what I've got to tell you\nis that’s one of the reasons\nwhy I didn’t sleep for two weeks\nwhen I first had access\nto GPT-4 back in August.\nBut we quickly realized\nthat to actually make it magical,\nI think what you saw\nwith Khanmigo a little bit,\nit didn't interact with you\nthe way that you see ChatGPT interacting.\nIt was a little bit more magical,\nit was more Socratic,\nit was clearly much better at math\nthan what most people\nare used to thinking.\nAnd the reason is,\nthere was a lot of work\nbehind the scenes to make that happen.\nAnd I could go through the whole list\nof everything we've been working on,\nmany, many people for over six,\nseven months to make it feel magical.\nBut perhaps the most\nintellectually interesting one\nis we realized, and this was an idea\nfrom an OpenAI researcher,\nthat we could dramatically improve\nits ability in math\nand its ability in tutoring\nif we allow the AI to think\nbefore it speaks.\nSo if you're tutoring someone\nand you immediately just start talking\nbefore you assess their math,\nyou might not get it right.\nBut if you construct\nthoughts for yourself,\nand what you see on the right\nthere is an actual AI thought,\nsomething that it generates for itself\nbut it does not share with the student.\nthen its accuracy went up dramatically,\nand its ability to be a world-class tutor\nwent up dramatically.\nAnd you can see it's talking\nto itself here.\nIt says, \"The student got a different\nanswer than I did,\nbut do not tell them they made a mistake.\nInstead, ask them to explain\nhow they got to that step.\"\nSo I'll just finish off, hopefully,\nyou know, what I’ve just shown you\nis just half of what we are working on,\nand we think this is just\nthe very tip of the iceberg\nof where this can actually go.\nAnd I'm pretty convinced, which I wouldn't\nhave been even a year ago,\nthat we together have a chance\nof addressing the 2 sigma problem\nand turning it into a 2 sigma opportunity,\ndramatically accelerating\neducation as we know it.\nNow, just to take a step back\nat a meta level,\nobviously we heard a lot today,\nthe debates on either side.\nThere's folks who take\na more pessimistic view of AI,\nthey say this is scary,\nthere's all these dystopian scenarios,\nwe maybe want to slow down,\nwe want to pause.\nOn the other side,\nthere are the more optimistic folks\nthat say, well, we've gone\nthrough inflection points before,\nwe've gone through\nthe Industrial Revolution.\nIt was scary, but it all\nkind of worked out.\nAnd what I'd argue right now\nis I don't think this is like\na flip of a coin\nor this is something\nwhere we'll just have to,\nlike, wait and see which way it turns out.\nI think everyone here and beyond,\nwe are active participants\nin this decision.\nI'm pretty convinced\nthat the first line of reasoning\nis actually almost\na self-fulfilling prophecy,\nthat if we act with fear and if we say,\n\"Hey, we've just got to stop\ndoing this stuff,\"\nwhat's really going to happen\nis the rule followers might pause,\nmight slow down,\nbut the rule breakers,\nas Alexandr [Wang] mentioned,\nthe totalitarian governments,\nthe criminal organizations,\nthey're only going to accelerate.\nAnd that leads to what I am pretty\nconvinced is the dystopian state,\nwhich is the good actors\nhave worse AIs than the bad actors.\nBut I'll also, you know,\ntalk to the optimists a little bit.\nI don't think that means that,\noh, yeah, then we should just relax\nand just hope for the best.\nThat might not happen either.\nI think all of us together\nhave to fight like hell\nto make sure that we put the guardrails,\nwe put in -- when the problems arise --\nreasonable regulations.\nBut we fight like hell\nfor the positive use cases.\nBecause very close to my heart,\nand obviously there's many\npotential positive use cases,\nbut perhaps the most powerful use case\nand perhaps the most poetic use case\nis if AI, artificial intelligence,\ncan be used to enhance HI,\nhuman intelligence,\nhuman potential and human purpose.\nThank you.\n(Applause)\n",
