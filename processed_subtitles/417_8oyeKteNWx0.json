  "text": "foreign\n[Music]\nServices YouTube channel in this video\nwe're going to talk about the top 10\nbest cyber security practices to prevent\nyourself from cyber attacks so we are\nnot going to waste any time and jump\nright inside the video at number one we\nhave enabling the firewall protection\nnow a firewall filters the traffic\nentering into your network it acts as\nthe first line of defense against the\ncyber attacks so that is why enabling\nfirewall is crucial to prevent yourself\nfrom cyber attacks in addition to that\nfirewall prevents unauthorized users\nfrom accessing your mail web and network\nresources now the cool thing about\nfirewall is that you can deploy\nfirewalls at multiple points within your\nnetwork so that is how firewalls is\nnecessary to prevent yourself from cyber\nattacks at number 2 we have the\nimplementation of endpoint protection\nfirstly the endpoint production is\ncuring and uses devices typically end\nuser devices such as personal computers\nmobile phones routers storage disk Etc\nare major weak points for cyber attacker\nsecondly endpoint action involves\nmonitoring and securing user devices\nagainst cyber threats now it combines\nboth device level and network level\ndefenses to restrict access to the\ncompany's ID systems that is how\nimplementing an endpoint protection can\nreally save your business at number 3 we\nhave the installation of anti-malware\nand anti-virus softwares the both\nanti-malware and antivirus software help\nprevent cyber attacks anti-malware\nprotection helps prevent militia\nattackers from impending malware into\nyour it systems whereas the anti-virus\nprotection deals with viruses Trojans\nand warm attacks so having both\nanti-malware and antivirus software is a\ncrucial step to safeguard your business\nat number 4 we have the use of\nmulti-factor authentication now a\nmulti-factor authentication helps\nprevent unauthorized people from logging\ninto your crucial Business Systems even\nif your credentials have been\ncompromised this is an additional layer\nin addition to your password that a user\nhas to pass before gaining access to\nyour account typically with a\nmulti-factor authentication you get a\nnotification on your mobile device on\neither your network which can be through\na SMS or a code to your authentication\napplication which can be Google\nAuthenticator or any other\nauthentication application on the market\nat number 5 we have connecting to a\nsecure Wi-Fi Now securing Wi-Fi is one\nof the Cyber Security's best practices\nto prevent from cyber attacks Wi-Fi\nnetworks can easily be hacked leading to\nthe compromise of entire company's\nNetwork so that is why having a secured\nWi-Fi is a crucial step to prevent\nyourself from cyber attacks after that\nat number 6 we have the vulnerability\nassessment now vulnerability assessment\ninvolves the scanning of the entire ID\nenvironment for vulnerabilities that can\nlead to cyber attacks now it helps\nreview any security weaknesses and the\nsusceptibility of an attack through a\nvulnerability assessment you can detect\nweak points and Implement remedies and\nmitigation to reduce the risk of attacks\nnow before moving on to the 7th best\npractice make sure to check out the link\nin the description box for the active\ndirectory and the Office 360 5 auditing\ntool which is known as infra SOS now\ninfrar SOS helps user confirm their\nactive directory and Office 365 users\nare compliant and secure from any\npotential cyber attacks again the link\nto infra SOS would be in the description\nbox after that at number 7 we have the\ncreation of stable cyber security\npolicies a cyber security policy is a\nset of documented rules and regulations\nand processes that an organization uses\nto elevate cyber attacks the policies\nset standards for behavior for\nactivities such as access of online\naccounts encryption of data use of\norganization resources and so much more\nnow a few examples of cyber security\npolicies can be Access Control policy\nbusiness continuity policy Disaster\nRecovery plan acceptable use policy and\nso much more at number eight we have\nsecurity training now strengthening the\nhuman element is among the best cyber\nsecurity practices to prevent yourself\nfrom cyber attacks now training your\nstaff against cyber attacks can highly\nreduce the risk of being a victim to\ncyber attacks such as phishing email\nscams and so much more so that is why\nyou really need to put emphasis on\ntraining your staff against these cyber\nattacks next up we have backing up your\ndata now a data backup is a copy of data\nstored in a separate search platform for\nuse in case of a malicious act or righty\ndisaster in addition a data backup is\nhelpful in the event of data loss or\ncompromise now this means that the data\nbackup can help you to prevent the\nbusiness downtime in case of any\nhardware failure or Cyber attack against\nyour business and lastly we have the\npassword policies now password policies\ncan help protect users against cyber\nattacks you should always Implement a\nstrong password policy to prevent\nunauthorized data access now for this\nyou can utilize a password manager now\npassword manager can help you with the\ncreation of the strong passwords and the\nmanagement of strong passwords now there\nare multiple password manager utilities\nwhich even include scams so be careful\nand choose only the authentic one note\nthat that also brings us to the end of\nthe top 10 best cyber security practices\nto prevent yourself from cyber attacks\nnow if you have learned anything new\nmake sure to leave a comment in the\ncomment section down below and finally\nif this video has helped you in any way\nmake sure to leave a like And subscribe\nto the channel\n",
