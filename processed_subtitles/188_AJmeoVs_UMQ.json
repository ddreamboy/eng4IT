  "text": "how to translate your existing videos\nfrom any language into any language that\nyou want to hey guys this is cheyen and\ntoday in this tutorial I'm going to\nreveal a secret AI tool that can do all\nthe hability for you and help you in AI\ndubbing of your videos from any language\nand translate it to any language that\nyou want to the best part over here is\nthat the video that would be produced as\noutput would have perfect lip sync and\nit would have the brand voice as well\nthat means if my voice was used in the\noriginal video then in the translated\nvideo it would be my voice that would be\nused so leveraging this power you can\nactually open up multilingual YouTube\nchannel just like Mr Beast or you can\nsell this as a service in different\nfreelancing networks as well so all of\nthese ways you can make insane money now\ndid I tell you that the AI tool comes\nfor free as well so I know you are very\ninterested so please stick on with me\ntill the end of this little tutorial\nbecause this is going to be a very short\nand to the point crisp tutorial don't\nskip any part of it and if you're new to\nthis channel do consider subscribing to\nthis channel to get updates just like\nthis without further Ado I know you are\nsuper excited so let's\nstart so it's time to reveal the tool\nthe AI tool is called H and AI as you\ncan see I right within H and AI right\nand H and AI has multiple capabilities\nnumber one it helps you to create this\nkind of instant avars of yourself which\ncan speak like you have gestures like\nyou and you can use them as your digital\nclone now I have got you covered with a\ncomplete H and AI tutorial as well if\nyou wish to take a look at that anytime\nduring this video or after watching this\nvideo you can find it in the description\nlink as well so currently I'm limiting\nmyself to only the relevant thing that\nis video translation so for that we'll\ncome over to this create video click on\nthat and as you can see it gives you two\noptions one is to create the AAR video\nlike the ones that I have told you and\nthen there's the video translation So\ncurrently we are more interested on\nvideo translation so let's go for that\nand in here as you can see you can\nupload a video that is in your local\ndrive or you can use a video URL that\nmeans you can go over to YouTube as well\nand you can import any video that you\nwish to now let's go for upload a video\nexample and in here I have got you\ncovered with a sample video which is\nshort in length so let's go ahead and\nactually do that so that I can show you\nin real time how it happens and then\njust click on create new translation\nthen you need to select the original\nlanguage so it's English and now I'm\ngoing to convert it into a Hindi\nlanguage video right and then you can\nhave the choice of number of speaker say\nit's a interview kind of thing then you\nneed to choose two speaker right so\nthat's up to you then there is the brand\nvoice now by default it's brand voice\nthat is the voice that was used right\nthen if you see over here it there's the\nenable Dynamic duration what happens is\nthat when a English video is converted\ninto a Hindi or some other language\nvideo the duration might shorten or\nmight elongate a bit right so it would\ndo that adjustment dynamically you give\nit the permission right then in here if\nyou don't want a lip sync you can do\nthat as well but I would like a lip sync\nthen there is include captions and then\nthere is use the original video specs or\nyou can also translate the text in the\nvideo if there's some text call out in\nthe video you can translate that as well\nso that being said let's submit and\nlet's see how the output looks like and\nas you can see see it is being created\nover here now as you can see I use this\ntool regularly right it has all these\naars now these are built-in aars also\nyou can create and use your own ofar as\nyou can see now this one is an example\nof another person's video on YouTube\nwhich I have translated into Hindi you\ncan see it over here as well so let's go\nahead and actually play this and see how\nit sounds now I would say you keep an\neye on the lip sync because this is very\nvery amazing technology that they have\nimplemented now let's play this take a\nlook at the lip sync and all the stuff\nright so let's\nplay so you can see that it's amazing\nright it's it's like he's a native Hindi\nspeaker but he isn't believe me it's a\nEnglish video that has been translated\ninto Hindi and it does it perfectly\nright so you can go ahead and download\nthis video you can share it one click\nyou can download the captions all of\nthat is pretty much possible now let's\nwait for this our example to finish up\nand as we speak as you can see it is\nbeing created so just to use up the time\nI'll show you some more features that it\nhas one of them is this Labs you can\ncome over to these labs and they have\ngot a feature where you can actually use\na URL to video as well as you can see\nover here so what this basically does is\nthat if you have an e-commerce kind of\nURL say your shop URL or your Amazon\nproduct review you are doing right you\ncan just fit in the URL and it would\nproduce this kind of videos just look at\nthis ever wondered how life could be\nwith the Asus V book5 let me so this\navar has been created by the tool itself\nand then all the background images and\nvideos they have been scraped from the\nURL so that's quite amazing if I\nactually go through this you would see\nit has actually scraped everything and\nit has got through the features\nimportant features and the best part you\ncan edit any and every part of it so\nthat is a great way to promote your Ecom\nproducts or if you are into Amazon\naffiliate or something like that you can\nuse this tool as well so the\nopportunities with haen is unlimited and\nit's a great great tool to to start off\nagain if you want to start out hent for\nfree of cost don't forget to sign up\nusing the link below right and you are\ngoing to get amazing amazing response\nwith this and look at this it has been\ncreated right now before just uh playing\nthe output let's see what the input is\nlike hey guys I'm recording this little\nvideo to demonstrate the AI video\ntranslation feature of a tool called\nhaen AI so you can see over here this is\nthe kind of video that I had created\nright so now let's go over to our output\nthis is our output so let's go inside of\nit and let's\nplay so you can see this it's amazing\nthe lip syn the kind of quality that it\nhas in Translation is quite magnificent\nnow what I can do essentially is that I\ncan create couple of YouTube channels\none for the English and one for the\nHindi but I don't need to create videos\nright I can just create a video in one\nlanguage and trans late the other so\nthat's a great way to actually enhance\nyour passive income list and then there\nis another way to make money out of it\nas well now if we go over to Fiverr and\nif we search for something called AI\ndubbing I'm not going for the normal\ntranslation because there are people who\ncharges a lot but these are AI dubbing\nright you can see people are saying it's\nAI dubbing and they are charging\nanywhere around, India rupees which is\n$10 and this is for just one minute of\nvideo translation right now if you are\ndoing a 10 minutes video translation a\nday which means you can make new nearly\n$100 a day out of it right and there are\npeople who are charging even more as you\ncan see over here so that's quite\namazing stuff to have so I really hope\nthat you guys have enjoyed this little\ntutorial if you have please help me with\na like and let me know in the comment\nsection if you have got any questions\nregarding any part of this tutorial also\nlet me know if you want to learn about\nany new AI tool and I'll try to cover it\nup in my next video with that being said\nthis is your good friend cheyen signing\noff don't forget to subscribe to this\nchannel hit on the Bell notification\nicon I will meet you on the next one\n[Music]\n",
