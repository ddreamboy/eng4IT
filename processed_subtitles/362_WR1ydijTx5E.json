  "text": "I dropped out of college, was\nin debt, working 60 hours a week,\nhated my job,\nand most importantly, I felt stuck.\nThis is the\nstory of how I learned how to code\nwithin four months, and I got a job.\nI did it with no computer science\ndegree or a coding BootCamp\nI am going to explain\nexactly what I learned, how I got\na job, and how much that job paid.\nLet's go.\nBefore\nI got into tech, I was working\na lot of dead end sales jobs,\nbecause I dropped\nout of community college and\nI didn't really have any other skills.\nI didn't like the\nidea of always having to hop from\njob to job If I didn't like something.\nI wanted something with a little\nbit more career mobility long term.\nI didn't\neven really know what coding was.\nI just\nknew that the tech industry was,\nlet's say, a great environment for\n$180 grand now\n$200 ish\n$250,000\n$400,000 annually\ngrowth... Yeah.\nBy the way, I'm not knocking sales.\nI think sales\nis a really important skill to learn.\nI just needed a change, and it\nreally just wasn't for me long term.\nAnd I wanted to gain the ability\nto build something of my own.\nThe idea of building\nsomething from zero to one\nseemed like a superpower to me.\nDay one,\nI just went on\nGoogle and I typed in how to code.\nThat's when I found a site called\nFreeCodeCamp, and I started\nto learn about web development.\nI quickly learned about HTML, CSS,\nand I learned\nabout my first real programming\nlanguage called JavaScript.\nThere's\na bunch of different programming\nlanguages that you could learn,\nbut I personally\nchose JavaScript because\nI wanted to build web apps.\nEven\nmajor companies like Uber and\nAirbnb use it, and there's a massive\ndemand for it in the job market.\nBy using FreeCodeCamp, I started\nto learn the basics of coding.\nI learned things like variables,\nloops, objects, and functions.\nBut even after\ndoing the tutorials, I didn't really\nfeel like I could apply to anything.\nAnd I still didn't\neven know how to do something\nas basic as building a website.\nAnd I realized that I learned how to\ncode, not exactly how to program.\nI was writing\ncode to solve logic problems,\nbut I didn't know how to program,\nwhich is using\nthe code to build something useful.\nAt this point, though, already\nI was starting to love the journey.\nI really liked problem solving,\nand I could see myself doing\nsomething like this long term.\nSo\nI did what any sane person would\ndo and I quit my job and I moved\nto Korea to minimize my expenses.\nAnd I decided to learn full time.\nLearning full time\nwas a lot harder than I thought.\nI've\nactually never studied anything\nthis complicated or tough before,\nand I was quickly starting\nto realize that I didn't really\nknow how to study at this pace.\nI would sit in front of my computer\nand hours and hours would go by.\nThat was when I went\nonline, I typed in how to learn.\nAnd\nI found a course called \"Learning\nhow to Learn\" by Barbara Oakley.\nThis course was life changing.\nMy two main\ntakeaways were one, it taught me\nhow to learn in space segments,\nA technique called Pomodoros.\nAnd the course\ntaught me that I needed to create\na dedicated space for learning.\nSo I joined a Coworking\nspace, so I could focus better.\nNow,\narmed with new knowledge, I got\nback to studying. And it worked.\nHere's\nwhat a normal day looked like.\n08:00 a.m wake up.\n8:30, Head to the train station.\n09:00\na.m. Arrive at the coworking space.\n9:15, Coffee Journaling\nreviewing the curriculum.\n9:30 to 12:30,\nI would have my first study session,\nwhere I did 30\nminutes increments of Pomodoros.\nFrom 12:30\nto 1:30, I would eat lunch and take a\nsmall break, then back to studying.\nFrom\n02:00 p.m to 6:30, it was more 30\nminutes increments of Pomodoros\nuntil I was ready to head out.\nFrom 6:30 to 7:30,\nI would gym three times a week,\nAnd then 8:30\nto 9:00, I would eat dinner with\nmy grandma, then help her clean.\nThis was my schedule\nfor six days a week, no exceptions.\nThe next part of FreeCodeCamp\nwas a lot more challenging.\nFront end projects.\nThey essentially give you a list\nof projects that you have to build\nusing HTML, CSS and JavaScript.\nTo me, this felt like\na massive jump because I never\nactually built anything before.\nI felt stuck at this stage\nuntil I found a YouTube channel\nof this guy named Stephen\nwho would stream himself\nbuilding these projects line by line.\nBy copying him\nand recreating what he was doing,\nI was able to\nuse that experience and build the\nnext couple of projects on my own.\nI also found a great resource\ncalled watchandcode.com,\nwhere you watch and code.\nBy following along once again\nand modeling others, the concepts\nreally started to take hold,\nand I was really starting\nto understand what I was doing,\nnot just solving a math problem.\nIn exactly one month, I ended\nup earning my FreeCodeCamp\nFront End Developer certificate.\nI was\nlearning a lot, but I never actually\nbuilt anything full stack before.\nSomething with a\nfront end or an interface, the thing\nthat you see within the browser.\nA database where all\nthe information lives, essentially,\nand a server\nwhich handles and manipulates\nall the data in the back end\nby taking\nin requests from the front end.\nSo I still felt like an\nimposter and not a real developer.\nYou're not an intellectual.\nYou're a fake and a fraud.\nSo to\nbecome a programmer, I decided\nto build my first full stack project.\nRemember\nStephen with a YouTube channel?\nI reached out to him\nto get his assistance to help me\nbuild my first full stack web app,\nwe decided\nto meet three times a week.\nHere's what we did.\nWe picked one\nmajor overarching project which\nwill teach me the basics of CRUD,\nwhich\nis Create, read, update and delete.\nThese are the foundations\nfor any web application.\nI decided to clone Pinterest.\nI honestly don't think\nI would have gotten a job without\nthis next part, so pay attention.\nI asked Stephen\nto treat me like a real junior\ndeveloper working at a company.\nWe implemented a project\nmanagement tool called Jira.\nWe used\nJira to compartmentalize the entire\nproject and write the requirements\nof exactly what I'd be building.\nThis taught\nme how to estimate my work\nand plan how to build an entire\nweb app from zero to launch.\nWe also set\nthe project up on GitHub, which\nis a version control application.\nThis taught me how to develop\ndifferent branches for when\nI was working on certain features,\nand I could learn how to control\ndifferent versions of the code.\nMost tech companies use some\nversion of the two applications\nbecause being a developer isn't\njust about knowing how to code.\nIt's about knowing\nhow to work collaboratively\nwith other people as well.\nStephen grilled me on\nour pair of programming sessions.\nHe was\nvery strict about me keeping the\ndeadlines and the estimates that\nI originally wrote out for myself.\nHe would constantly question\nwhy I was doing what I was doing.\nAnd\nhe even taught me the concept\nof DRY, just Don't Repeat Yourself,\nor essentially\njust making reusable code.\nI had to learn how\nto build by Googling for answers\nand using sites like Stack Overflow.\nAnd he\nwould leave me a lot of comments\non things that I needed to change.\nSo I learned\nhow to debug my code on my own.\nThis made\nme feel like I was a real developer.\nat this time, I supplemented\nmy learning journey with\nUdemy courses on React and Node\nbecause these\nwere the two frameworks that\nI chose to build my Pinterest clone.\nAs a result of building\nmy first full stack project, I ended\nup learning how to do things like\nhow to design a database, build\nAPIs, set up Auth, and eventually\npush the app to a cloud server.\nThese\nare all things I would have never\nlearned by just doing tutorials.\nAnd\nin around two months, I finished\nmy first full-stack web app.\nI remember when I finished the\napp, I felt like a real programmer.\nThat's when reality\nset in and I realized I'm still broke.\nI haven't made a single\npenny in over a couple of months,\nand I still needed to find a job.\nIt was time\nto see if everything that I learned\nwas actually worth anything.\nFirst,\nI defined the job that I wanted.\nI wanted to be remote. And most\nimportantly, I wanted to work for\na small to medium sized company,\nbecause I hate working\nin a corporate environment.\nI found\nall the jobs that fit my parameters\non sites like weworkremotly.com\nand remoteok.io\nAnd instead\nof just applying to these jobs,\nI found\nthe contact information of the\nhiring managers and developers\nwho worked at the company,\nand I messaged\nthem to introduce myself.\nI explained\nexactly what I had learned up until\nthis point,what I was looking for.\nI even included\nthe link to my GitHub so they could\nsee the projects that I had built.\nMost importantly,\nI included an offer that\nI know that they couldn't refuse.\nI offered to work for free.\nAnd I understand\nguys, not everyone can afford to do\nthis, but I had originally estimated\nthat this was going to take\nme around four months anyways.\nAnd I had\nanother month of time that I could\nessentially dedicate to learning.\nI knew all I had to do\nwas get my foot into a company,I\ncould essentially learn there\nand then prove\nmy worth over time to leverage\nthat into a real job long term.\nOverall, I found around\n22 jobs I thought fit the parameters\nof what I was looking for.\nI got\naround six responses. From those\nresponses, I got four interviews.\nAnd out\nof the four interviews, I ended up\ngetting three legitimate job offers.\nEven\nthough I had offered to work for\nfree, after the technical interviews,\nthe employers thought that I had\nenough skills at that point where I\nwas worth hiring for a full time job.\nI ended up choosing the company\nwith the best opportunity to learn,\nand that\nalso happened to have the best\ncompensation package as well.\nMy first salary was\n$50,000 a year,\nand\nthen after my probationary period,\nI was making $65,000 a year.\nMy benefits\nkicked in like health and dental.\nBut the\nbiggest perk for me was that I got\nto work remotely the entire time as\nlong as I worked the US time zone.\nI'm\nnot saying that you'll be an expert\ndeveloper if you follow this plan.\nI'm just sharing what I did to\nlearn just enough to land me a job,\nas\nmost of the progress that I've had\nas a developer all came on the job.\nNo luck here, just focused effort.\nNow, I've been\nworking in tech for over a decade,\nand let me\nbe the first to tell you that nobody\ncares about your credentials.\nLearning\nhow to code was mainly two things\nlearning how to solve problems,\nand two, persisting until you find\nthe answer that you're looking for.\nIf you're interested in seeing\nus learn more cool stuff, make\nsure to subscribe to the channel.\nAnd also, if you want\nto see me apply these principles\nto something other than coding,\nlike something\nartistic, click on this video.\nWhere we're going to put it?\nHere?\n",
