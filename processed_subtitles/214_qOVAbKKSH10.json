  "text": "the blockchain is a term that has come\nto mean many things to many people\nfor developers it is a set of protocols\nand encryption technologies for securely\nstoring data on a distributed network\nfor Business and Finance it is a\ndistributed ledger and the technology\nunderlying the explosion of new digital\ncurrencies for technologists it is the\ndriving force behind the next generation\nof the Internet for others it is a tool\nfor radically reshaping society and\neconomy taking us into a more\ndecentralized world\nwhichever way you look at it blockchain\nhas become a term that captures the\nimagination and fascinates many as the\nimplications of such technology are\ntruly profound for the first time in\nhuman history people anywhere can trust\neach other and transact with in large\npeer-to-peer networks without\ncentralized management trust is\nestablished not by centralized\ninstitutions but by protocols\ncryptography and computer code this\ngreatly strengthens our capacity for\ncollaboration and cooperation between\norganisations and individuals within\npeer networks enabling us to potentially\nform global networks of collaboration\nwithout centralized formal institutions\nunprecedented but hugely relevant in an\nage of globalization and a new set of\n21st century challenges that require\nmass collaboration\nChane is a complex technological\neconomic and social phenomenon it calls\ninto question what might have seemed to\nbe established parameters of the modern\nworld like currency economics trust\nvalue and exchange to make sense of this\none needs to understand it in a holistic\ncontext all the way from its\ntechnicalities to it's aspirational\npotential this course is designed to do\nexactly that by giving a 360-degree\noverview to the different dimensions of\nthe technology its potential application\nwithin various industries and its\nfar-reaching implications for society\nand economy\nin the first section of the course we\ngive an overview to the blockchain both\non a technical and non-technical level\nwe also discuss the importance of the\nblockchain within the context of the\nemerging next-generation Internet\nin the second section we talk about the\nblockchain as a so-called trust machine\nand how it enables transparency and\ncollaboration we will look at\ndistributed ledger technology talking\nabout smart contracts etherium and\ndecentralized applications\nin the third section we introduce you to\nthe workings of token economies\nillustrating how the blockchain and\ndistributed Ledger's can work to build\nvibrant ecosystems through the use of\ntokens to incentivize behavior\nsection of the course we will be looking\nat specific applications of the\nblockchain to economy society technology\nand environment looking at both existing\npractical applications and potential\nfuture applications\nthe blockchain is a so-called emerging\ntechnology that is currently\nexperiencing very rapid evolution within\nthe space of just two or three years it\nhas already gone through changes in its\ntechnical implementation and our\nunderstanding of what it is and can be\nas such our aim is to future-proof this\ncourse by not dwelling excessively on\nexisting technical implementations but\npresenting a more conceptual\nunderstanding of the blockchain within\nthe broader process of change of the\nemerging next-generation Internet\nis much more than a technology it is\nalso a culture and community that is\npassionate about creating a more\nequitable world through decentralization\nit is a movement to disrupt the\ndisruptors to redesign the Internet and\nin so doing shake up existing\ncentralized incumbents throughout the\ncourse we will introduce you to this\nculture and its aspirations\nthis course is non technical in nature\nit is an introductory course and thus\nall terms will be explained it should be\naccessible to anyone with a basic\nunderstanding of web technologies and\neconomics\nin this video we're going to give a\nhigh-level overview\nlooking at the primary dimensions of\nthis technology that we call the\nblockchain will first talk about the\nunderlining technology then the\ndistributed edges that this technology\nsupports then the token economies that\ncan be built on top of that ledger\nsystem will only touch on these topics\nhere to get an overview before going\ninto them in more detail in future\nvideos on its most basic level the\nblockchain is a new class of information\ntechnology that combines cryptography\nwith distribute computing both of which\nexisted for a number of decades it was\nthe genius of Satoshi Nakamoto to\ncombine them in new ways to create a\nmodel where a network of computers\ncollaborate towards maintaining a shared\nand secure database as such we can say\nthe blockchain as the technology is\nsimply a distributed secure database\nthis database consists of a string of\nblocks each one a record of data that\nhas been encrypted and given a unique\nidentifier called the hash mining\ncomputers on the network validate\ntransactions add them to the block\nthey're building and then broadcast the\ncompleted block to other nodes so that\nall have a copy of the database because\nthere is no centralized component to\nverify the alterations to the database\nthe blockchain depends upon a\ndistributed consensus algorithm in order\nto make an entry onto the blockchain\ndatabase all the computers have to agree\nabout his state so that no one computer\ncan make an alteration without the\nconsensus of others once completed a\nblock goes into the blockchain as a\npermanent record each time a block gets\ncompleted a new one is generated there\nis a countless number of such blocks in\nthe blockchain all connected to each\nother by links in a chain in proper\nlinear chronological order the\nblockchain was designed so that\ntransactions are\nmutable meaning they cannot be deleted\neach block contains a hash value that is\ndependent upon the hash of the previous\nblock so they're all linked together\nmeaning if one is changed then all the\nother blocks linked to it going forwards\nwill be altered this works to make the\ndata entered tamper proof what we've\ndescribed here is the workings of the\nfirst generation of block chains which\nfunction largely simply as databases but\nthe technology is currently evolving to\nbecome much more than this as the second\ngeneration already provides the capacity\nto execute any computer code on the\nblockchain the system is evolving to\nbecome a globally distributed tile\ncomputing infrastructure and as we'll\ndiscuss in a future video it remains\nvery much a work in progress when seen\nfrom this perspective blockchain\ntechnology works to create a permanent\nand secure database this makes\nblockchain suitable for the storage of a\nrecord or transaction that involves\nvalue or in some way it needs to be a\nsecure and trusted source of information\nthese secure distributed records are\ncalled distributed Ledger's a\ndistributed ledger is a consensus of\nreplicated shared and synchronized\ndigital data geographically dispersed\nacross multiple sites countries or\ninstitutions without centralized\nadministration or centralized data\nstorage being maintained instead by a\ndistributed network of computers such\nLedger's can be used for any form of\nasset registry such as inventory or\nmonetary transactions this might include\nthe recording of hard assets such as\nphysical property cars homes etc or\nintangible assets such as currencies\npatents votes identity healthcare data\nor any other form of valuable\ninformation\nthis distributed ledger technology\nenables us to replace a multiplicity of\nprivate databases within each\norganization with one shared database\nthat is trusted and accessible by all\nparties involved in this respect the\nblockchain enables trust between parties\nthat may otherwise not trust each other\nthe results greatly strengthen our\ncapacity for collaboration between\norganizations or between individuals\npeer to peer without dependency on third\nparties centralized institutions\nlikewise their results in transparency\nand many other efficiencies this is of\nmajor significance as we currently have\nmany centralized organizations that may\nbe internally optimized but the inter\norganizational space in between them is\nreally inefficient with huge amounts of\nborder friction redundancy arbitrage and\nresources wasted on competition by\nenabling trusted into organizational\nnetworks these Ledger's enable the\nformation of organization and\ncollaboration where previously there was\nnone such as across whole supply chains\nor for different healthcare providers to\ncollaborate around the patient's needs\nor for different transport providers to\ncollaborate in delivering and integrated\nlogistics network\nlikewise second-generation blockchains\noffer the possibility to automate the\nworkings of these networks through what\nwe call smart contracts smart contracts\nare computer code that is stored inside\na blockchain which encode contractual\nagreements these smart contracts are\nself executing contracts with the terms\nof the agreement or operation directly\nwritten into lines of code which are\nstored and executed on the blockchain\nlike normal computer programs these\ncontainers hold algorithms that take an\ninput of data and depending on the value\nof the input trigger certain events for\nexample this might be a financial\ncontract that takes as the input the\namounts of money in a person's accounts\nif it is above a certain level then it\nincreases the interest rate that they\nearn on their deposits such smart\ncontracts can be used for automating and\nmany basic operations on the network\nonce again working to remove the need\nfor intermediary third party\ninstitutions as smart contracts can be\ntrusted a tamper-proof\nand executes automatically\nmuch of the current discussion\nsurrounding blockchain remains at the\nlevel of the technology and the\npossibilities of distributed edges as he\nshared trusted database enabling the\ncollaboration between organizations with\nthe resulting disintermediation of\ncentralized institutions and market\nexchanges however its implications go\nfar beyond this as the blockchain\nconcepts is more than just a database or\nledger it is a new organizing paradigm\nfor the discovery validation and\ntransfer of all discrete units of value\nand the developments of distributed\norganizations via token market systems a\ntoken is a quantified unit of value that\nis recorded on the blockchain this value\nmay be of any kinds it may be likes on\nsocial media it might be a currency it\nmight be the integrity of an ecosystem\nor might be an electrical units token\nnetworks consists of a network of\nindependent nodes that act autonomously\nbut through incentive structures and the\nsignaling system of the market\nself-organized to create emergent\ncoordination and thus a distributed\nmanagement system for example we might\ncreate a clean air token where anyone\nwho provides a service that contra\nbuttes to the maintenance and provision\nof clean air can earn tokens for example\nby planting a tree while those who\npollutes by say operating a combustion\nengine have to pay in air tokens thus\ninstead of having a centralized\nAuthority and a Clean Air Act's we have\na token market that works to create\nsignals that align people's incentives\nwith maintaining and growing the\nunderlining resource likewise the same\nmodel could be applied to the management\nof technology infrastructure as an\nexample we could think of traffic\ncontrol we currently have traffic\ncontrol systems in cities whose\noperations are monitored by centralized\ncontrol centers but in a world of\nautonomous vehicles and the blockchain\ncars could signal to each other its\nappear bidding tokens to see which gets\npriority\nin such a way the system has dynamically\nallocated resources and self-organized\nvia distributed token networks in short\nblockchain is not just an information\ntechnology but also an institutional\ntechnology in that it enables us to\ndesign incentive structures in the form\nof token economies and in such a way\nconverts centralized organizations into\ndistributed markets via token economics\nthis is where things start to get quite\ncomplex as you move into the realm of\ndesigning economies and incentive\nsystems for coordinating human activity\nin a decentralized fashion something\nthat could potentially enable the\ncoordination of human activity at a much\nlarger scale than has been possible\nbefore the great design innovation of\nthe blockchain is really its capacity to\ncoordinate a network of autonomous nodes\ntowards maintaining a shared\ninfrastructure and this is done not just\nthrough innovations in information\ntechnology but also through the design\nof incentive systems which has\ntraditionally been the domain of\neconomics through adding a layer of\ntrust and value exchange to the Internet\nthe blockchain merges our newly\ndeveloped information networks with the\ninstitutional structures that sit on top\nof them in so doing it greatly\nstrengthens the capacity of those\nnetworks as a new mode for organizing\nsociety and economy by merging economics\nand technology it enables us to redesign\ninstitutional structures and ultimately\nreconceptualize how we organize\nvirtually every aspect of society\neconomy and even technology\ninfrastructure based on networks of\nautonomous nodes that are incentivized\nto collaborate of course it does not do\nthis alone such claims can only be\nrealized in combination with other\ntechnologies and broader processes of\nchange as such the blockchain has to be\nunderstood in the context of a broader\nset of technological transformations\ntaking place with the current evolution\nof the internet most notably much\nwhat the blockchain promises will only\nbe possible given parallel developments\nin the Internet of Things data fication\nand advanced analytics all of which are\ncombining to form the next generation of\nInternet of which the blockchain will be\na critical infrastructure\nin this video we're going to talk about\nthe basics of the blockchain as the\ntechnology on its most basic level the\nblockchain can be understood as a new\nkind of database at least this was its\noriginal design what's different about\nthis database is that it's distributed\ndigital databases have been around for a\nwhile now but until recently they've\nbeen designed to centralize information\non one computer or within one\norganization the blockchain though uses\na distributed network of computers to\nmaintain a shared database the\nblockchain is then a set of protocols\nand encryption methods than enable a\nnetwork of computers to work together in\nsecurely recording data within a shared\nopen database this database consists of\na series of encrypted blocks that\ncontain the data the blockchain is a\ncontinuously growing list of these\nblocks of data which are linked and\nsecured using cryptography this makes it\na trusted database with this trust being\nmaintained by open secure computer code\nan encryption instead of any single\ninstitution the database stores\ninformation in blocks that are linked\ntogether through hash values with\nentries to this database being made by\ncomputers that all have a copy of the\ndatabase and all must come to consensus\nabout its state before they can update\nit so these are three central concepts\nto understanding the system's workings\nthat of blocks and hashing mining and\nproof of work and distributed consensus\nwe'll go over each of these separately\nin terms of its structure a block chain\nmay be considered as a series of blocks\nof data that are securely chained\ntogether new blocks are formed as\nparticipants create new data or wish to\nupdate existing data these blocks are\nencrypted and given a hash value that\nrepresents a unique identifier of the\ndata within that block this hashing\nworks by a standard\nalgorithm being run over the blocks data\nto compress it into a code which is\ncalled the hash which is unique to that\ndocuments no matter how large the file\nor what information is contained it is\ncompressed into a 64 character secure\nhash this hash value can be recalculated\nfrom the underlining file confirming\nthat the original contents have not\nchanged but the reverse is not possible\ngiven just the hash value you cannot\nrecreate the blocks data contained\nwithin it which is encrypted all blocks\nof data which are formed after the first\nblock are securely chained to the\nprevious one this means that the hash\nvalue of the next block in the chain is\ndependent upon the previous one thus\nonce recorded the data in any given\nblock cannot be altered afterwards\nwithout the alteration of all subsequent\nblocks as well as this hash pointer\nlinking to the previous block each block\ntypically contains as well a timestamp\nso that we know what happened and when\nit happens this hashing and linking of\nblocks makes them inherently resistant\nto the modification of their data making\nthem immutable records you can only\nwrite data to the database and once it's\nthere it's very hard to change almost\nimpossible thus data is stored on the\nblockchain is generally considered\nincorruptible blockchain security\nmethods include the use of what we call\npublic key cryptography a public key\nwhich is a long random looking string of\nnumbers is an address on the blockchain\nvalue tokens sent across the network are\nrecorded as belonging to that address\na private key is like a password that\ngives its owner\naccess to their digital assets or the\nmeans to otherwise interact with the\ncorresponding data a public key is\nassociated with the private key so that\nanyone can make an encrypted transaction\nto the public key address but that\nencrypted message can only be deciphered\nwith the private key that corresponds to\nthat public key in such a way effective\nsecurity only requires keeping the\nprivate key privates\nthe public key can be openly distributed\nwithout compromising security for\nexample on the Bitcoin blockchain to\nreceive funds from another person you\nuse a piece of software called the\nwallets which creates a public key that\nyou give to someone else for them to\nsend bitcoins to that address with your\ncorresponding private key you can then\naccess that address with those bitcoins\non it\nthe blockchain is a distributed system\nthis means there is no centralized\norganization to maintain and verify the\nentries on the database this database is\ninstead maintained by a large number of\ncomputers that are incentivized to\nprovide computing resources by earning\nsome form of tokens in exchange\nbut these computer nodes in the network\nthemselves cannot be trusted\nindividually\nthe city's required that the system\nprovide a mechanism for creating\nconsensus between scattered or\ndistributed parties that do not need to\ntrust each other but just need to trust\nthe mechanism by which their consensus\nhas been arrived down any computer that\nis connected to the blockchain network\nand using a client can perform the task\nof validating and relaying transactions\neach of these so-called minor computers\ngets a copy of the blockchain which gets\ndownloaded automatically upon joining\nthe network when new entries into the\ndatabase are made these changes are\nautomatically broadcast across the\nnetwork mining nodes validate\ntransactions add them to the block their\nbuilding and then broadcast the state of\nthe complete block to other nodes on the\nnetwork in order to randomize the\nprocessing of blocks across the nodes\nand to avoid certain service abuses\nblock chains use various time stamping\nschemas such as proof of work proof of\nwork describes a system that requires a\ncertain amount of resources or effort to\ncomplete an activity typically this\nresource is computing time as in the\ncase of the Bitcoin blockchain this is\nrealized on some form of challenge such\nthat no one actor on the network is able\nto solve this challenge consistently\nmore than everyone else on the network\nminers compete to add the next block in\nthe chain by racing to solve a very\ndifficult cryptographic puzzle the first\nto solve the puzzle wins the lottery as\na reward for his or her efforts the\nminer receives the small amounts of\nnewly minted bitcoins and a small\ntransaction fee it can sense this\nalgorithm like bitcoins proof-of-work\nfunctions to ensure that the next block\nin the blockchain is the one and only\nversion of the truth and it keeps\npowerful adversaries from derating the\nsystem block chains are trying to create\na secure trusted shared database and\ndo this through encryption and hashing\nproof of work and network consensus the\nhashing and linking of blocks makes it\ndifficult to go back and change a\nprevious block once it's entered but\nthis alone would not be suffice to\nensure that the data is truly tamper\nproof so then the proof of work system\nintentionally makes it computationally\nmore difficult to alter the database\nthus making it extremely difficult to\nalter all the blocks on top of this it\nplaces that distributed consensus\nmechanism so that even if someone did\nmanage to do this their record would not\nmatch that of others and thus would not\nbe accepted as a valid record so to\nsuccessfully tamper with the block chain\nyou would need to alter all the blocks\non the chain redo the proof of work for\neach block and take control of more than\n50% of the peer-to-peer network only\nthen would your altar block become\naccepted by everyone else on a block\nchain of almost any size this would be\nalmost impossible to do indeed the\nBitcoin blockchain is very good proof of\nthis given that it now secures hundreds\nof billions of dollars using this method\nwithout the network having yet been\ncompromised at the end of the day what\nthis technology enables is a database\nthat is secured with automatic trusts\nthat is enabled by open source code and\nencryption the data is tamper proof once\ninformation is put into the database it\ncannot be altered afterwards it is a\nshared database as many people across a\nnetwork have a copy which is\ncontinuously being updated so that all\nhave a single source of truth likewise\nit is transparent meaning that everyone\ncan see all of the transactions and\nalterations made to the database if\nneeded data quality and the resilience\nof the network is maintained by massive\ndatabase replication across many\ndifferent nodes on the network no\ncentralized official copy exists and no\nuser is trusted more than any other\nhaving started out life is simply a\nmechanism to enable Bitcoin it has\nbecome increasingly recognized that this\nsystem is secure enough to work as a\nledger for the recording and exchange of\nany value what we now call a\ndistribution there germ over the past\nyears blockchain evolving fast from the\noriginal Bitcoin protocol to the second\ngeneration aetherium platform to today\nto where were in the process of building\nthe third generation of block chains in\nthis evolution we can see how the\ntechnology is evolving from its original\nform as essentially just a database to\nbecoming a fully fledged globally\ndistributed cloud computer in this video\nwe're going to trace the past present\nand future of blockchain technology the\nfirst blockchain was conceptualized in\n2008 by an anonymous person or group\nknown as Toshi Nakamoto the concepts and\ntechnicalities are described in an\naccessible white paper termed Bitcoin a\npeer-to-peer electronic cash system\nthese ideas were then first implemented\nin 2009 as a core component supporting\nBitcoin where it served as the public\nledger for all transactions the\ninvention of the blockchain for Bitcoin\nmade it the first digital currency to\nsolve the double spending problem\nwithout the need of a trusted Authority\nor central server it was only later that\nwe came to really separate the concept\nof the blockchain from that of its\nspecific implementation as a currency in\nBitcoin we came to see that the\nunderlining technology had a more\ngeneral application beyond digital\ncurrencies in its capacity to function\nas a distributed ledger tracking and\nrecording the exchange of any forms of\nvalue the Bitcoin design has been the\ninspiration for other applications and\nhas played an important role as a\nrelatively large scale proof-of-concept\nwithin just a few years the second\ngeneration of blockchains emerged\ndesigned as a network on which\ndevelopers could build applications\nessentially the beginning of its\nevolution into a distributed virtual\ncomputer this was made technically\npossible by the development of the\netherium platform aetherium is an\nopen-source public blockchain based\ndistributed computer platform featuring\nsmart contract functionality it provided\na decentralized turing-complete virtual\nmachine which can execute computer\nprograms using a global network of nodes\naetherium was initially described in a\nwhite paper by the italic Bertrand in\nlate 2013 with a goal of building\ndistributed applications the system went\nlive almost two years later and has been\nvery successful attracting a large and\ndedicated community of developers\nsupporters and enterprises the important\ncontribution of etherium as the second\ngeneration of blockchains\nis that it worked to extend the capacity\nof the technology from primarily being a\ndatabase supporting Bitcoin to becoming\nmore of a general platform for running\ndecentralized applications and smart\ncontracts both of which we'll discuss in\ncoming videos as of 2018 aetherium is\nthe largest and most popular platform\nfor building distributors applications\non many different types of applications\nhave been built an app from social\nnetworks to identity systems to\nprediction markets and many types of\nfinancial applications aetherium has\nbeen a major step board and with its\nadvent it has become ever more apparent\nwhere we're heading with the technology\nwhich is development of a global\ndistributed computer a massive globally\ndistributed cloud computing platform on\nwhich we can run any application at the\nscale and speed of today's major\nwebsites with the assurance that it has\nthe security resilience and\ntrustworthiness of today's block chains\nhowever the existing solutions that we\nhave are like extremely inefficient\nComputers the existing blockchain\ninfrastructure is like a really bad\ncomputer that is not able to do much\nexcept proof of concepts getting to the\nnext level remains still a huge\nchallenge that involves some original\nand difficult computer science game\ntheory and mathematical challenges\nscalability remains at the hearts of the\ncurrent stage in the journey that were\non and this is what the third generation\nof blockchain technologies are trying to\nsolve the mining required to support the\nBitcoin network currently consumes more\nenergy than many small nations being\nequal to that of Denmark and costing\nover 1.5 billion dollars a year in the\nlectures deem a lot of this is being\nfueled by cheap but dirty coal energy in\nChina where almost 60% of the mining is\ncurrently being done this high energy\nconsumption is simply not scalable to\nmass adoption etherium and Bitcoin use a\ncombination of technical tricks and\nincentives to ensure that they\naccurately record who owns what without\na centralized Authority the problem is\nit's difficult to preserve this balance\nwas also growing the number of users\ncurrently blockchain requires global\nconsensus on the order an outcome of all\ntransfers in aetherium all smart\ncontracts are stored publicly on every\nnode of the blockchain which has its\ntrade-offs the downside is that\nperformance issues arise in that every\nnode is calculating all the smart\ncontracts in real time which results in\nthose speeds this is clearly a\ncumbersome task especially since the\ntotal number of transactions is\nincreasing approximately every 10 to 12\nseconds with each new block added the\nvolume of transactions is likewise an\nexisting constraint with cryptocurrency\nspeed is measured by TPS transaction per\nsecond the Bitcoin network theoretical\nmaximum capacity is up to seven\ntransactions per second while the\nethereum blockchain as of 2018\ncan hand\nabout 15 transactions per seconds by\ncomparison a credit card network is\ncapable of handling more than 20\nthousand transactions per seconds\nequally Facebook may have about 900\nthousand users on the site in any given\nminutes meaning that its handling about\na hundred and seventy thousand requests\nper second another issue is that of cost\nthe fact that it costs some small amount\nto run the network so as to pay the\nminers for maintaining the ledger what\nwe have is okay for a limited number of\nlarge transactions such sending money\nbut making a small transaction by\npurchasing a coffee could not be done by\nmost block chains they simply can't in\ntheir existing form deal with a very\nlarge amount of micro transactions such\nas will be required to enable\nhigh-volume machine-to-machine exchanges\nit would prove too expensive to operate\nthese kind of economies that involve\nmany small exchanges but this is exactly\nwhat many people will want to use the\nblockchain for in the future\nin response to these constraints a third\ngeneration of blockchain networks are\ncurrently under developments many\ndifferent organizations are currently\nworking on building this next-generation\nblockchain infrastructure such projects\ninclude Definity Neo Geo's iota and a\ntheorem itself they're each using\ndifferent approaches to try and overcome\nexisting constraints going into the\ndetails of how these different networks\nwork is a bit advanced for this course\nso we'll just give a brief overview to\ntwo of them the Lightning Network is one\nsuch project that seeks to extend the\ncapacities of existing block chains the\nmain idea is that small and non\nsignificant transactions do not have to\nbe stored on the main blockchain this is\ncalled an off chain approach because\nsmall transactions happen off of the\nmain goal chain it works by creating\nsmall communities where in transactions\ncan take place without each of those\ntransactions being registered on the\nmain blockchain a payment channel is\nopened between a group of people with\nthe funds been frozen on the main\nblockchain those members can then\ntransact between each other using their\nprivate key to validate the transactions\nthis is a bit like having a tab or an\nIOU with the shop where you just mark\ndown what you've exchanged so that you\ndon't have to update the main record in\nthe bank each time you make a purchase\nthe record stays local between the\nmembers involved before at some time\nsetting the finances and updating the\nmain bank record this only requires two\ntransactions on the main blockchain one\nto open the transaction channel and once\nclosed here all other transactions\nhappen just within the network without\nit being registered on the main\nblockchain this both reduces the\nworkload on the main blockchain and\nmakes it possible to run a very many\nvery small transactions within the sub\nnetwork as of the start of 2018 there is\na proof-of-concept running live on the\nBitcoin test net but the system will not\nbe fully operational until later in the\nyear as is the case with most of these\nprojects IATA is another example where\nas existing block chains are sequential\nchains where blocks are added in a\nregular linear chronological order the\ndata structure of the iota system is\nable to achieve high transactional\nthroughput by having parallel operations\nthe data structure is more like a\nnetwork rather than a linear chain\nwherein processing and validation can\ntake place alongside each other the\nother big difference is that there are\nno specialized minors in this network\nevery node that uses the network\nfunctions as a minor in the i/o to\nnetwork every node making a transaction\nalso actively participates in forming\nthe consensus that is to say everyone\ndoes the mining this means that there is\nno centralization of mining within the\nnetwork which is what creates\nbottlenecks and demands lots of energy\nlikewise with this network there are no\ntransaction fees for validation and with\niota because it is more user generated\nthe more people that use the network the\nfaster becomes which is the opposite of\nexisting systems and obviously makes it\nvery scaleable there are lots of other\npossible approaches to overcoming\nexisting constraints but suffice to say\nthe blockchain should be understood as\nan emerging technology whose existing\nimplementation is like a large-scale\nproof-of-concept running on a very\ninefficient system but through lots of\nexperimentation and iteration well\nhopefully in the coming years evolved\ninto this global distributed computer as\nnan Lee Swan writes in her book first\nthere was the mainframe PC personal\ncomputer paradigms and then the internet\nrevolutionized everything mobile and\nsocial networking were the most recent\nparadigm the current emerging paradigm\nfor this decade could be the connected\nworlds of computing relying on\nblockchain cryptography\nto understand this better in the next\nsection we're going to talk about the\nblockchain in the context of the broader\ntechnological changes that are currently\nunderway as we build the next generation\nof the Internet's what we call the\ndecentralized web or web 3.0 how we\nunderstand the blockchain and where we\nare with it today is extremely\ntransitory in this respect what we're\ntalking about in this course when we\ntalk about the blockchain is ready this\nemerging IT infrastructure of a\ndistributed global cloud computer the\nnext generation of block chains will\ntake us a step further on that journey\nwhat we called the blockchain today is\nreally just a very limited and often\nvery inefficient version of this we\nstill have many very difficult problems\nto solve before we'll get there possibly\nthat end stage will look something like\nthe blockchain of today but possibly it\nwould look very different\npeople will make big claims about the\npotential of the blockchain to\nrevolutionize the foundations of social\nand economic organization but the\nblockchain can only have such potential\nas part of a broader ecosystem of\ntechnologies that are emerging as the\nnext generation of the Internet's what\nmay be called web 3.0 or the\ndecentralized web today powerful\ntechnological changes are coalescing to\ntake us into a new technology paradigm\nthese include the rise of advanced\nanalytics coupled with data fication and\nthe Internet of Things the blockchain\nwill have to work synergistically with\nthese if it's true capacities are to be\nrealized but to understand this next\ngeneration web we need to understand a\nbit about the history of the Internet\ngoing back to the early 90s web 1.0 was\nthe first generation of the world wide\nweb it was based primarily on the\ntechnology of HTTP which worked to link\ndocuments on different computers and\nmake them accessible over the Internet\nHTML was then used to display these\ndocuments so that any connected computer\nwith a browser could access and read a\nweb page this first iteration of the web\nwas all about information as it enabled\nus to exchange information much more\nefficiently and head Sagat the name\ninformation superhighway even though it\nwas a revolution in information exchange\ncontent creators were few with the vast\nmajority of users simply acting as\nconsumers of contents it was really very\nstatic and lacked interactivity whereas\nin the web 1.0 era people were limited\nto pass a viewing of contents with web\n2.0 websites allowed users to interact\ncollaborates and become the creators of\ncontents with web 2 people could not\nonly read from the web but also write to\nit and thus it got the nickname the\nreadwrite web by the early 2000s\nnew server-side scripting technologies\nsuch as PHP enabled developers to easily\nbuild applications where people could\nwrite information to a database with\nthat information then being dynamically\nupdated every time they refresh the page\nalmost all of the websites that dominate\nthe web today are based on this\nserver-side scripting technology it gave\nthe social networking blogging video\nsharing obey YouTube Facebook and all\nthe other large platforms the most\npeople spend most of their internet time\nusing the idea of web 3.0 has been\naround for a while but it's only very\nrecently with the development of the\nblockchain that it is actually starts to\nbecome something real web 2.0 has\nevolved to become highly centralized\naround very large platforms running out\nof ever larger data centers creating\nmany issues surrounding security privacy\ncontrol and concentration of power in\nthe hands of large enterprises it's only\ntoday that these issues are starting to\nenter into mainstream discourse web 3 is\nset to disrupt this whole technology\nparadigm as the critical change that is\ncoming about is the word D centralizing\nthe web the blockchain provides the\nprotocols and cryptography for a\nglobally distributed network of\ncomputers to collaborate on maintaining\na public secure database and with a\nvirtual machine like aetherium we can\nrun code on this creating a new set of\ndistributed applications these new\ntechnologies of the blockchain ipfs and\nthe distributed web enabled us to\nreconfigure the internet into a\ndistributed global computer so that\nwe're no longer dependent upon the web\nplatforms and data centers of web 2.0 to\nrun the internet but now can build and\nrun applications on this shared global\ncomputing infrastructure as might be\npolled of the Institute for the future\nnoted it starts with the realization\nthat the internet that we know today is\nonly one possible interpretation of the\noriginal vision\nof an open clear to peer network\nindependent of any centralized\ntechnology commercial entity or\nsovereign governments think of it as a\nfirst curved internet one that is\nincreasingly vulnerable to abuse and\neven collapse to date we've largely\ntaken the infrastructure of the internet\nfor grants it's all of the innovation\nand action has been focused on the\napplication layer that sits on top of it\non web applications like social\nnetworking or e-commerce with the\ndevelopments of blockchain and\nparticularly with this third generation\nwe're starting to innovate on the low\nlevel protocols asking not if we can\nbuild a better web application but if we\ncan build a better internet the\nimplications of the decentralized web\nare indeed radical in that it enables us\nto create automated services\ndisintermediate existing incumbents and\nenable people to set up their own secure\nnetworks of exchange empowering them in\nnew ways the blockchain will be a core\npart of web 3.0 but the next-generation\ninternet would also see the convergence\nof the Internet of Things and big data\nanalytics the ongoing fundamental\nprocess of data fication will be a key\naspect to this next-generation Internet\nas we increase in the instrument our\nworld's data will flow from all sources\nabout everything data fication is the\nterm given to our newly found ability to\ncaptures data many aspects of the world\nin our lives that have never been\nquantified before this process results\nin what we call big data vast amounts of\nunstructured data that can be mined by\nadvanced analytical methods to gain new\ninsight into the world around us this is\nimportant with respect to the blockchain\nbecause firstly it means we'll have a\nlot of sensitive data that we want to\nstore secondly we will be quantifying\naccounting for and exchanging all sorts\nof value that we did not or could not in\nthe past thirdly such a diversity of\nsources of data\ncombined with advanced analytics which\ncould find cross correlations and\npatterns within it can provide a new\nsource to verify the data that is being\ninputted to the blockchain without\ndepending on a centralized Authority for\nvalidation the next-generation internet\nwill be much smarter\nwhereas web 1 was dumb and web 2 was\ndynamic web 3 will incorporate various\naspects of machine learning and\ncognitive computing as a service as it\nbecomes infused into almost all\napplications making the web truly\nadaptive responsive and personalized\nwhereas web 1 and web 2 were largely\nabout people exchanging information in\nweb 3 machines will come online and the\ninternet will become something much more\nphysical as billions of devices and\nactuators connected to all sorts of\nthings from tractors to watches to\nfactories and drones enabling them to\ninteract and coordinate machine to\nmachine the value of the Internet of\nThings IOT will not be in making one\ndevice or system smart it will be in\nenabling seamless processes across\nsystems\nthis will require open networks that can\ncommunicate and coordinate components on\ndemand across domains organizations and\nsystems the envision of IOT is not to\nhave our lives populated with thousands\nof smart things but instead to change\nour world from discrete things to\nservice processes to do this these\ntechnologies will have to communicate\nsecurely it appear dynamically\nallocating resources and this will\nrequire some kind of distributed secure\ninfrastructure like the blockchain and\nlikewise micro economies this ties in\nwith the broader process of change which\ncomes about as we move into a services\neconomy called services ation which is\nthe shift from products and the\nownership of things to the access of\nservices on demands for example instead\nof only a car you simply have access to\na car sharing service\nthis economy of temporary usage VA\nservices requires the formation of\nfrictionless markets and automated\nexchanges that the blockchain is\nwell-suited to support as we'll discuss\nin a future video these components of\nthe next generation internet the\nblockchain the Internet of Things and\nadvanced analytics are each of them very\npowerful technologies that will have a\nprofound effect on society they will\ntake us much further into this new\nworlds of the information age as power\nshifts in a radical way from people in\nhierarchical institutions to automated\nnetworks and the algorithms that\ncoordinate them in the coming decades\nmore and more of our systems of\norganization will move to the Internet\nand it will become vastly more complex\nthan today in web-one and web 2 we\ndevelop the internet from small to large\nthrough a client-server architecture the\nwork decentralized the web around large\ndata centers but the internet after data\nfication and all these IOT devices have\ncome online will not be large it will be\nmore like infinite you can get from\nsmall to large by centralizing but you\nget from large to infinity through\ndistributing and that's what the\nblockchain can do for this next\ngeneration Internet\ntechnologies are just tools that enable\nus to do things the interesting part of\nthe blockchain is really what it enables\nin terms of new forms of distributed\norganization as one commentator noted\nthe blockchain is an institutional\ntechnology not an information technology\nthere's an enormous difference between\nthe two institutional revolutions are\nthings that don't happen very often\nblockchain technology enables new forms\nof network distributes to organizations\nsomething that runs very much contrary\nto our existing organizational paradigm\nand that's what makes it somewhat\ndifficult for us to understand the\norganizational model of the Industrial\nAge that we inherit today was one of\ncentralization in order to achieve\neconomies of scale through mass\nproduction thus reducing unit cost and\nproviding for a mass society the\ntechnologies of the Industrial Age\nselectively favored centralization of\nproduction within closed hierarchical\norganizations manufacturing is in\ncentralized factories transport systems\nare centralized around transport hubs\neducation within schools and\nuniversities entertainment centralized\nwithin mass media organizations and\ngovernance centralized within state-run\norganizations and so on the information\nrevolution is in the process of taking\nus into a new world of distributed\nnetworks as the organizational paradigm\nof the Information Age the combination\nof telecommunications networks and\ncomputerized coordination enables us to\nreplace centralized management with\nenclosed hierarchies with open networks\nas the underlining technology matures\nwere able to convert more and more\nsystems that were previously closed and\ncentralized and have them managed\nthrough automated networks and the\nblockchain is just one more stage in\nthis process we saw this with the rise\nof the online platforms like eBay uber\nor Alibaba social networks blogging etc\nthat built massive networks of uses\nexchanging goods and\nservices but these platforms were still\ndependent upon the centralized\norganization to manage the shared\ndatabase for the computing\ninfrastructure for the algorithms for\nfinancial transactions and to enable\ntrust and authentication in the network\nthe decentralized web takes these\nplatforms a step further by offering a\nshared open and secure database that can\nbe trusted by all parties and a set of\nprotocols for the secure exchange of\nvalue between organizations and\nindividuals peer-to-peer the web\nplatforms are open networks this means\nthey do not just optimize within a given\norganization but can enable coordination\nacross whole industries indeed this is\nwhy and how they're quickly supplanting\nthe closed organizations what\ncentralized organizations enabled was\ntrust cooperation and coordination\nwithin organizations but what the\nblockchain enables is trust coordination\nand cooperation between organizations\nand between individuals if we look at\nhow our society and economy is currently\norganized\nwe'll see many closed organizations that\nare internally optimized but when we\nlook at the inter organizational space\nit's extremely inefficient along many\ndimensions if we look at the way\nbusinesses coordinate along a supply\nchain or the way nation-states\ninteroperate in the global political\nsystem we will see there is huge\nredundancy and friction caused by\ndiscontinuities a classical example of\nthis is the border system between\nnation-states and the bureaucratic\nprocedures for obtaining a visa for\nmoving from one nation to another which\ncreates a massive amount of friction at\nthe inter organizational space and it's\nbecause those organizations don't have\nan effective into organizational\ninfrastructure for collaboration and\ncoordination this greatly reduces the\noverall effectiveness of these systems\nand the delivered outcome for the end\nuser when we look internal to these\norganizations they look like efficient\nwell-oiled machines but when we look\nbetween them the whole space is very\ninefficient\nthe whole space is very ineffective at\ndelivering overall outcomes and this is\npart of the significance of the\nblockchain because it provides a shared\ntrusted database between organizations\nit has the potential to switch to\ndynamics within economy and society from\ncompetition between close centralized\norganizations to collaboration between\norganizations and greatly strengthened\nworking capacities across organizational\nboundaries the results of this would be\nmuch more efficient overall societal and\neconomic outcomes indeed we can note\nthat achieving coordination across\norganizations could result in quantum\nleaps in delivering outcomes and our\ncapacity to tackle major global\nchallenges of today such as\nenvironmental degradation where weak\nexisting into organizational\ninstitutional infrastructure has gained\nlittle traction in this respects the\nblockchain has the potential to give us\nnot just incremental improvements but an\norder of magnitude greater capacities\nwithin society through collaboration\nwithin whole ecosystems it is precisely\nthis coordination across organizations\nindustries nations and people that is\nrequired to provide the resources needed\nto tackle some of today's most complex\nchallenges and it's precisely this that\nis significantly absent within existing\ninstitutional structures because of the\ncentralizing forces prevalent within the\nindustrial age we live in societies that\nare operated by many different closed\norganizations many different companies\nall producing cars and competing for\nmarket share many different governments\nthat all focus on the interests of their\ncitizens over those of others many\ndifferent health care providers\ntransport providers at cetera\nthe results of this is though a huge\namount of inefficiency in redundancy\nwhen taken as a whole many different\ncompanies all recreating the wheel\nwithin their own organizations and\nexpending huge amounts of time and\nenergy on trying to get ahead of their\npeers\nwe assume that this is the normal state\nof operations that it's just human\nnature in some way but in fact it's\nreally just a function of the\ninstitutional structures we have built\nover the past centuries as game theory\nwill tell us people respond to the\nincentives and the socio-economic forces\nacting on them in the absence of\ncooperative structures competition is\noften the optimal strategy for\nindividuals and organizations but once\nthere is the institutional structures to\nenable trust and coordination between\nmembers cooperation can become a much\nmore viable strategy for the agents\ninvolved because the blockchain enables\nthis shared and trusted database that\ndoesn't belong to any single\norganization it makes it greatly more\npossible and viable for organizations to\ncollaborate on a single solution or\nsingle source and achieve much better\nresults for each organization and the\neconomy as a whole as an example of this\ncooperation across different closed\norganizations we could think about the\ndesign and construction of a building\nthere may be many different companies\ninvolved in this process or creating\ntheir own designs and diagrams for the\nbuilding with each having to\ncontinuously contact each other to\naccess exchange and cross-reference all\nthis information given a single shared\ndatabase they could though or\ncollaborate on a single design of the\nbuilding making for a greatly more\nefficient overall process while at the\nsame time each organization would\nbenefit and thus the overall results are\nmore efficient likewise the same is true\nfor identity we currently have many\ndifferent copies of our identity spread\nacross many different organizations\ngovernments social networks employees\netc but each of these only has a partial\nunderstanding of us currently we're\nrecreating the will for each\norganization while data and reputation\ndoes not move well between them instead\na single identity could be created on\nthe blockchain that belongs to the\nindividual with each organization then\ncontributing to this data as they work\ntogether to create\na more complete record of identity and\nreputation in so doing we've moved from\nall those frictions between these closed\norganizations to collaboration and\nsynergies between them creating\nsomething that is greater than any of\nthe parts they had before the same for a\nsupply chain instead of each participant\nholding their own documents and records\nduring each stage in supply chain a\nsingle record for the item could be\ncreated on the blockchain with each\norganization then contributing their\ninformation to it to create a single\nsource of truth that is accessible to\nalways need it while at the same time\nbeing more secure than having separate\nrecords in each centralized database the\nend results of this new institutional\ntechnology is a much greater capacity\nfor inter organizational collaboration\nand powerful ecosystems that are greater\nthan the sum of their parts given that\nall our current systems of organization\nthat are centralized could be\ndecentralized in this fashion using\nblockchain technology we can see how it\nreally could enable every organization\nof society and economy organizations\nwithin society rarely operate in\nisolation they function as parts of\necosystems and the value for society is\nnot created by anyone but instead by the\nflow of value across the ecosystem it's\nnot Apple that delivers our iPhones\nit's a massive global supply chain of\nhundreds of different organizations\ncollaborating whereas our previous\ninstitutional structures optimized for\nindividual organizations the blockchain\noptimizes for the value within the whole\necosystem and thus potentially a much\ngreater value for society as a whole the\ninformation revolution is changing the\nworld from disconnected to connected the\ngenie of hyper-connectivity is out of\nthe bottle and connectivity along\nvirtually all dimensions is\nproliferating daily as a consequence our\nsystems of organization will change from\nbeing based around fixed structures and\nboundaries to being coordinated via\nconnections\ninstead of the controller components\nthrough fixed higher\nstructures organization would emerge out\nthe interaction and the exchange of\nvalue along those interactions enabling\nthat will require a massive build-out of\nsecure frictionless information networks\nthis global cloud computer of blockchain\nto understand better how this shared\ndatabase that enables inter\norganizational collaboration works we'll\ntalk about distributed ledger technology\nas we've been talking about the\nblockchain is like another layer to the\nInternet that enables secure trusted\nrecords and transactions between people\nwho may not otherwise trust each other\nthe trust is in the technology computer\ncode in mathematics rather than people\nand centralized institutions in this\nrespect people sometimes talk about the\nblockchain as a trust machine in its\ncapacity to enable a network where Trust\nis created by design it's built into the\nsystem automatically because the\nblockchain creates a trusted database it\ncan function as a record of value\nstorage in exchange these records of\nvalue and transactions may be called\nLedger's since ancient times\nLedger's have formed the backbone to our\neconomies to record contracts and\npayments for the buying and selling of\ngoods or the exchange of assets like\nproperty these ledges started out as\nrecords in stone clay tablets and\npapyrus and later paper as they evolved\ninto the ledger books supporting modern\naccounting these Ledger's enabled the\nformation of currencies trade lending\nand the evolution of banking\nover the last couple of decades though\nthese records have moved into the\ndigital realm as whole rooms of people\nworking to maintain accounts have been\nreplaced by digital computers which have\nmade possible the complex global\neconomic system we live in today this\nrecord-keeping system is once again\nbeing revolutionized as these Ledger's\nare shifting to a global network of\ncomputers which is cryptographically\nsecure fast and decentralized what we\ncall distributed ledger or distributed\nledger technology DLT for shorts a\ndistributed ledger can be described as a\nledger of any transactions or records\nsupported by a decentralized network\nfrom across different locations and\npeople eliminating the need of a\ncentralized Authority\nall the information on ledger is\nsecurely and accurately stored using\ncryptography and can be accessed using\nkeys and cryptographic signatures any\nchanges or additions made to ledger are\nreflected and copied to all participants\nin a matter of seconds or minutes the\nparticipants at each node of the network\ncan access the recording shared across\nthe network and can own an identical\ncopy of it at the same time these\nnetworks make constantly available for\nexamination a full audit trail of the\ninformation history which can be traced\nback to the moment when a piece of\ninformation was created and every\nparticipant in the network can get\nsimultaneous access to a common few of\nthe information these Ledger's can be\nused for the recording tracking\nmonitoring and transacting of all forms\nof assets all asset registries\ninventories and exchanges including\nevery area of economics finance and\ncurrencies physical assets such as cars\nand houses and intangible assets such as\nvotes ideas health data reputation etc\nin this case the blockchain can serve as\na public record repository for whole\nsocieties including the registration of\nall documents events identity and assets\nin this system all property could become\nsmart property this is the notion of\nencoding every assets of the blockchain\nwith the unique identifier such that the\nasset can be tracked controlled and\nexchanged on the blockchain for example\ndistributed edges could be used to\nreplace or supplement all existing\nintellectual property management systems\nas they can register the exact content\nof any digital asset such as a file\nimage health record or code to the\nledger and give it a unique identifier\nin the form of the hash values that we\ndiscussed earlier there are two main\nclasses of distributed ledger public\nLedger's and permission Ledger's\nthe former type is maintained by public\nnodes and is accessible to anyone\nBitcoin is a well-known example of a\npublic blockchain where anyone can read\nthe chain anyone can make legitimate\nchanges and anyone can write a new block\ninto the chain ripple is an example of a\npermission blockchain where the creators\nof the network determine who may act as\ntransaction validators on that network\ndistributed ledger platforms in each\ncategory have their own unique features\nsome are designed for specific types of\napplication and others for more general\nuse for instance in the quarter DLC\nplatform which is a consortium of more\nthan 70 of the world's largest financial\ninstitutions the sharing of individual\nledger data is limited to parties with\nthe legitimate need to know which is not\nthe case for public platforms DLT\ntechnology can have a powerful\ndisintermediation effect as data can be\nput directly onto the shared database by\nthe nodes in the network there is no\nlonger need for a centralized\norganization to provide this service a\ndeveloper can create a DLT on a\nblockchain and use public/private key\ncryptography to give people secure\nstorage space on that ledger allowing\npeople to own their own data which\ncreates a very different scenario to the\nworld we live in today\ncurrently centralized organizations like\nGoogle and Facebook suck up all of the\nlittle bits of data we need behind us\nand use it to serve us customized\nadvertisements from which they create\ntheir revenue this results in a huge\npower imbalance within society where\ncentralized organizations armed with\nteams of mathematicians and computer\nscientists use mountains of data to\ninfluence people's behavior towards\npurchasing with products of their\nappetizers data that is a very valuable\nasset and the information society and of\ncritical importance to tackling major\nsocietal challenges is being used\nagainst us in many ways creating a\nstumbling\nthe societies are becoming increasingly\naware of in a world of distributed edges\npeople have their own little databases\non the blockchain and can own their own\ndata giving it to organizations to use\nwhen and where needed\nfundamentally reversing the current\ndynamic and truly empowering individuals\nyour health records reside in your\nhealth ledger and different health care\nproviders can access and update that\nsingle record but only with the\npermission of the end-user as the data\nremains theirs and they choose who can\nhave access to it likewise when people\nown their own data on a distributed\ntheir germ they can transact directly\nits appear as is the case with Bitcoin\nwith the existing traditional system\nwhen you pay for a ride in a taxi with a\ncredit card it looks like you're paying\nthe driver directly when in fact what is\nhappening is that a database record\nbelonging to my bank is being debited\nand a database belonged to the bank of\nthe company that the driver works for is\nbeing credited in this respect we can\nnote that in our society value and data\ndo not really belong to individuals all\nthe time they're being held behind the\nwalls of some centralized organization\nand we are dependent upon them to secure\nand validate it's creating huge power\nimbalances within society in contrast\nwith the Bitcoin blockchain the\nindividual has a ledger record and a\nsecure key with which they can access\ntheir records when they send money they\nsend it directly to the other person's\nrecord it simply gets debited from your\nrecord and added to theirs directly\npeer-to-peer no centralized organization\nholds that data distributed ledger\ntechnology can greatly improve\ntransparency reduce corruption and\nimprove security while reducing overhead\ncosts of auditing accounting and legal\nissues currently records of value are\nhidden within the databases of\ncentralized organizations where they're\nlargely in excess\nfor their many possible uses within\nother systems they are open to\nmanipulation by members within those\norganizations which breeds corruption\nand because of that there has to be all\nsorts of regulation and legal\nrequirements that create many overhead\ncosts and it's this they are centralized\npoints of failure for critical data\nsources as large concentrations of\nvalued data proved very attractive for\nmalicious actors likewise it is\ninefficient to be constantly updating\nand synchronizing data across many\ncentralized databases by putting the\ninformation on a shared ledger it can be\neasily made accessible and visible on\ndemand as needed\nbecause there is tamper proof we can\nremove many existing points of\ncorruption and the associated need for\nregulation likewise it is made secure by\ndistributed networks without a single\npoint of failure and continuously\nsynchronized across all nodes to create\na single source of truth for all users\none of the key technology innovations of\nsecond-generation blockchains\nhas been the development of what are\ncalled smart contracts smart contracts\nare computer code that is stored inside\nof a blockchain which encode contractual\nagreements smart contracts are self\nexecuting with the terms of the\nagreement or operation directly written\nin two lines of code stored and executed\non the blockchain computer a contract in\nthe traditional sense is a binding\nagreement between two or more parties\nto do or not do something each party\nmust trust the other parties to fill\ntheir side of the obligation they are a\nwritten or spoken agreement that is\nintended to be enforced by law a\nmultiplicity of different contractual\nagreements form the institutional\nfoundations to our modern society and\neconomy which have evolved since ancient\ntimes if we think about something as\nseemingly simple as a cafe serving a cup\nof coffee we will see that this process\nis really enabled by a massive amount of\ncontractual agreements between different\nparties that enable them to cooperate in\ndelivering that outcome contracts\nbetween employees and employer of the\ncoffee shop contracts that provide\nworkers with health coverage contracts\nthat ensure the coffee-shop contracts\nbetween suppliers along the supply chain\ncontracts between property owner and\ntenant etc our economies are powered by\na massively complex set of contractual\nagreements that are currently created\nand enforced by centralized\norganizations like insurance companies\nand banks which themselves are supported\nby the ultimate centralized authority in\nthe system\nthe nation-states institutions are\nsocieties and economies almost\ncompletely dependent upon third party\norganizations to maintain and enforce\nthose contractual agreements smart\ncontracts feature these same kind of\nagreements to act or not act\nbut they removed the need for the\ntrusted third party between members\ninvolved in the contracts this is\nbecause a smart contract is both defined\nby the computer code and executed or\nenforced by the code itself\nautomatically without discretion at such\nblockchains as smart contract technology\ncan remove the reliance on centralized\nsystems and enable people to create\ntheir own contractual agreements that\ncan be automatically enforced and\nexecuted by the computer code these\nsmart contracts are decentralized in\nthat they do not subsist on a single\ncentralized server but are distributed\nand self executing across a network of\nnodes\nthis means that untrusted parties can\ntransact with each other in a much more\nfluid fashion without depending upon\nthird parties to initiate and maintain\nthe rules of the transaction likewise\nsmart contracts enable autonomy between\nmembers meaning that after it is\nlaunched and running a contract in its\ninitiating agents need not be in further\ncontacts one illustration of this\nconcept is offending machine unlike a\nperson a vending machine operates\nalgorithmically you provide the source\ninput of money and product selection\nwhich the machine takes as input and\nsimply execute on a rule automatically\nto produce the pre-specified output the\nsame instruction set will be followed\nevery time in every case when you\ndeposit money and make a selection the\nitem is released there is no possibility\nof the machine not wanting to or not\nfeeling like complying with the contract\nor only partially complying as long as\nit's functional there's another example\nwe can think about a situation where\nfour people pool their money to make a\njoint investment that will return\ninterests of them a smart contract could\nbe programmed on the blockchain to take\nany interest that is created divided\ninto four and sent each amount to the\ncorresponding wallets of the different\nstakeholders\na smart contract is then ready just an\nAccounts on the blockchain that is\ncontrolled by code instead of by user\nbecause it's on the blockchain it is\nimmutable that means the code cannot be\nchanged and thus all participants in\nthis investment can be assured that they\nwill get their fair share automatically\nthe code dictates how the process will\ntake place and no individual has the\npower to change it no individual no\norganization no government can censor\nalter or manipulate the contracts in\nthis respect it's often said that code\nis law in the sense that the code will\nexecute no matter what of course\ncomputer code has been for a while now\nacting as the law for example as\nservices have gone online we're\nincreasingly faced with web forms that\nstrictly control what inputs are allowed\nif you want to buy an item on iTunes USA\nthen you'll have to have a credit card\nwith the US address the system will also\nenforce this by not letting you complete\nthe purchase with an incorrect address\nas another example a logistics company\ncould use smart contracts to execute\ncode that says if I receive cash on\ndelivery at this location then trigger a\nsupplier request to stock a new item\nsince the existing item was just\ndelivered\na combination of smart contracts with\nblockchain encoded property gives us the\nidea of smart property smart property is\nsimply property whose ownership is\ncontrolled via blockchain encoded\ncontractual agreements for example a\npre-established\nsmart contract could automatically\ntransfer the ownership of a vehicle\ntitle from the holding company to the\nindividual owner when all the loan\ninstallments have been cleared the key\nidea of smart property is controlling\nownership and access to an asset by\nhaving it registered as a digital asset\non the ledger and connecting that to a\nsmart contract in some cases physical\nworld hard assets could quite literally\nbe controlled via the blockchain one\nexample of such an IOT blockchain system\nis SLOC it a door lock that is connected\nto a smart contract on the blockchain\nwhich controls when and who can open the\nlock this enables anyone to rent sell or\nshare their property without need of a\nmiddleman with such innovations parking\nspots can be subletted on-demand\nAirbnb accommodation could become fully\nautomated or someone with twenty bikes\nin Bangladesh could rent them out with\nsmart contract locks the bike could shut\nitself off if it is not been paid for or\nif it's stolen then there could be an\nautomatic deposit system or likewise if\nthe person wanted they could simply pay\na certain price to purchase the bike at\nany time\nlike all algorithms smart contracts\nrequire input values and only act if\ncertain predefined conditions are met\nwhen a particular value is reached the\nsmart contract changes its state and\nexecutes that programmatically\npredefined algorithms automatically\ntriggering an event on the blockchain\nthus the workings of the overall\ncontracts can only be as good as the\ninputted data if both data is imported\nto the system then false results will be\noutputted blockchains\ncannot access data outside of their\nnetwork\nthus requires some form of trusted data\nfeed as input to the system what may be\ncalled an Oracle an Oracle is a data\nfeed provided by an external service and\ndesigned for use in smart contracts on\nthe blockchain Oracle's\nprovide external data and trigger smart\ncontract executions\nwhen predefined conditions are met such\nconditions could be any data like\nweather temperature the quantity of\nitems in stock the completion of a\nsuccessful payments changes in the\nprices on the stock market etc an Oracle\nin the context of block chains and smart\ncontracts is then an agent the finds and\nverifies real-world occurrences and\nprovides this information to a\nblockchain to be used by smart contracts\nOracle's are third-party services which\nare not part of the blockchain consensus\nmechanism thus whether it be a news feed\nwebsite or a sensor the source of\ninformation needs to be trustworthy as\nan example we could think of an online\nbetting platform based on the blockchain\nthat uses smart contracts to\nautomatically execute payouts to people\nwho have placed bets on sports matches\nthe smart contract system would then\nhave to be connected to a trusted Oracle\nto provide it with the score of the\nmatches as of present this Oracle would\nlikely have to be associated with some\ntrusted third party centralized\norganization like a sports channel or\nBloomberg for stock prices however in\nthe future through data fication an IOT\npervasive sensing this might also be\nautomated given the use of advanced\nanalytics using automated Oracle's that\ndraw data from a myriad of sources and\ncomplex analytics to find cross\ncorrelations that provide a statistical\nassurance that for example a given event\noccurred or did not occur the advantages\nof smart contracts are numerous firstly\nthey are automatic which could remove\nthe\ntime and costs associated with managing\nand enforcing them making them more\nefficient as they can be cheaper and\nfaster to run through this form of\nautomation a much greater amount of\nexchange could take place that otherwise\nwould have never happens in such a way\nwe can see how distributive edges and\nsmart contracts are key parts in\nenabling a true services economy where\nownership is displaced by temporal usage\nthrough the on-demand provisioning of\nservices secondly they could reduce\ncorruption as code is both transparent\nin its workings and automatically\nexecuted this leaves the room for\nindividuals or organizations to alter it\nto their advantage thirdly they can\nreduce dependency upon centralized\norganizations that people may be able to\nset up their own contractual agreements\npeer to peer thus limiting the arbitrary\npower of centralized organizations\nlastly they can also deliver certainty\nas smart contracts guarantee a very\nspecific set of outcomes that are\npredetermined before hands enabling all\nparties know exactly what will happen\nbut herein also lies some of their\nlimitations by automating the execution\nof a contract they are dependent upon\nformal rules with well specified inputs\nand leave little room for a multiplicity\nof eventualities where the rules may\nneed to be slightly altered because of\nunforeseen circumstances for example a\ncar that's being used on demand that\noperates through a smart contract may\nsimply shut the user out if they have\nnot paid their bill and would take\nlittle accounts of the facts but it may\nbe a life-or-death emergency usage in\nthe real world many unpredictable and\nunforeseen events to occur and rules\nsometimes need to be flexible and adapt\nSporto accommodates and this is one\nadvantage of having human oversight as\npeople are much more capable at judging\nsuch circumstances and responding\nappropriately to complex unforeseen\neventualities so the degree to which we\ncan automate contracts is relative\nthe kind of environment that is being\noperated in and in more complex\nsituations they will often need to be\nsome form of governing body to intervene\nwhen needed and this creates new\ncomplications surrounding governance\nthat are still yet to be figured out the\nadvent of the etherion platform in 2015\nhas worked to provide a virtual\ncomputing infrastructure for running\napplications on the blockchain this new\nform of program is called a distributed\napplication or DAP for short aetherium\nwas the first developer platform for\nbuilding distributed applications it was\na foundational general-purpose\nblockchain based platform that is a\nturing-complete virtual machine meaning\nthat it can run any computer code\nalthough etherium was the first and\nstill the largest platform for building\ndistributed applications there are now\nothers such as block stack oreos all of\nwhich provided the underlining\ninfrastructure for building DAB's\nour working definition of a DAP is an\napplication that runs on a network in a\ndistributed fashion with participant\ninformation securely protected and\noperations executed in a decentralized\nfashion across a network of nodes taps\nuse open source code operate\nautonomously with data and records\ncryptographically stored on a blockchain\non a technical level a tab is very much\nsimilar to a normal web application\nexcept unlike with the normal web app\nwhere the back-end code is running on a\ncentralized server a dab has its code\nrunning on a distributed peer-to-peer\nnetwork a tap can have front-end code\nand user interfaces written in any\nlanguage just like a normal app as such\ntaps will often look and feel very much\nlike regular apps and people will soon\nbe using them in the coming decade\nwithout even realizing him like all apps\nperform specific functions whereas\nbitcoin is the decentralized value\nexchange a decentralized application\naims to achieve functionality beyond\ntransactions the middie exchange value\nmany types of decentralized apps are\nstarting to emerge as the underlining\ntechnology continues to progress already\nwe can see many tabs represent\nalternatives to the existing popular web\napplications probably the most\nsuccessful DAP to date is steam it steam\nit is a blogging and social networking\nwebsites on top of the steam it\nblockchain database\nthe general concept is very similar to\nother blogging websites or social news\nsites like Reddit but the text content\nis saved in a blockchain using a\nblockchain enables rewarding comments\nand posts with secure tokens value in\nthis way users can earn currencies for\ntheir posts and comments likewise for\nexisting marketplace applications like\neBay and Craigslist we have the\ndecentralized version open Bazaar open\nBazaar is an open source project\ndeveloping a protocol for e-commerce\ntransactions in a fully decentralized\nmarketplace because the application\nconnects people directly via peer to\npeer network it cost nothing to download\nand use it unlike sites like eBay or\nAmazon there are no fees to list items\nand no fees when an item is sold open\nBazaar is not a company like eBay but an\nopen source projects each user\ncontribution etwork equally and is in\ncontrol of their own storage and private\ndata\nanother example is Storch which is the\ndecentralized cloud storage application\nsimilar to job box storage is based on\nblockchain technology and peer-to-peer\nprotocols to provide secure private and\na-fishing cloud storage system the\napplication incentivizes storage\nproviders and connects them with those\nwho require it each file saved on the\napplication is free\nencrypted and spread across the network\nuntil you're ready to use it again the\nkeys to the database remain with the\nowners meaning the data is not\naccessible by a centralized cloud\nprovider there are many other examples\nof DAPs but the general concepts can be\napplied to any area that requires secure\nrecords and benefits from\ndecentralization these applications are\nautomated which means they can operate\nat very low or even zero cost because of\ntheir snaps may be used to disrupt the\nexisting platform economy as whole\nplatforms like uber or Airbnb may\neventually be converted into dabs that\nrun automatically without the need for\nthe centralized platform the advantages\nof dabs is that they're fully automated\nhave superior fault tolerance and\ntrustless execution these decentralized\napps potentially represent the next\ngeneration of computing because the\nblockchain is a secure system that\nenables a trusted network it's often\ndescribed as a value exchange protocol\nin this respect people often say that\nwhat the web did for the exchange of\ninformation the blockchain will do for\nthe exchange of value just as the web\nrevolutionized the use an exchange of\ninformation within society disrupting\nwhole industries based upon the\ncentralization of information so to the\nblockchain is set to do the same for the\nrecording and exchanging of all forms of\nquantifiable value this idea of value\nlies at the hearts of the blockchain if\nthere is no value involved in the\nprocess then there is no need for trust\nand no need to use the blockchain the\nvision of the internet of value is for\nany quantum of value to be exchanged as\nquickly and as fluidly as multimedia is\ntoday on the web\nalthough multimedia can move around the\nworld almost instantaneously a single\npayment from one country to another is\nslow expensive and unreliable\noften taking days and involving numerous\nintermediary third parties to validate\nand process transactions at a\nsignificant cost\nthus it is no accident that the first\nwidespread use of the blockchain was for\ncurrencies because it is the most\nimmediate and obvious source for\nquantified value within society however\nto truly understand the revolutionary\npotential of this technology is to\nappreciate how value and its exchange\ninfluences and regulates almost all\naspects of human affairs as a\nconsequence the control of how value\ngets defined measured and exchanged is\nthe key source of power and control\nwithin society and has been since the\norigins civilization today value of\nalmost any kind is defined quantified\nand regulated by centralized\norganizations whether this is a national\ngovernment creating their own currency\nor one's role within a hierarchy\ndefining one's economic status or the\nbranded clothing that we wear to signal\nto others our social status and value in\nsociety however the move into the\nnetworked society shifts the locus of\norganization from closed institutions to\nindividuals and networks but off chain\ntechnology is a key element enabling\nthis process by creating a shared ledger\nwhere people can own their own data it\nalso enables a shift in the locus of\nvalue within economy to the individual\nin networks in a world of limited\nconnectivity limited transparency\nunlimited peer-to-peer trust it was\nnecessary to have third party\ninstitutions to define quantify and\nauthenticate sources of value within\nsociety and economy but in a world of\npervasive peer-to-peer connectivity\ntransparency and trusted low cost\nautomated networks value can be defined\nthrough a negotiation between peers\nwithin distributed networks\nthe rise of digital currencies about one\nsuch example of this the surprising\nthing for a lot of people is that most\nmajor currencies like the dollar yen and\neuro aren't backed by anything they're\njust pieces of metal paper and entries\nin a bank account that get their value\nfrom everyone simply believing that they\nhave value and accepting them as a\nmedium of exchange and that's all it's\nreally necessary\ncurrencies and money work a little bit\nlike languages they are subject to\nnetwork effects to give them value the\nmore people who agree to and understand\nthe language the more valuable that that\nspecific language has as a form of\ncommunications dollars remnant B euros\nand bitcoins have no intrinsic value\nthey're all social protocols and they\nmerely represent a way of supporting the\nvalue flows between individuals in the\npast because of low levels have trusted\nhere connectivity we required\ncentralized institutions like\ngovernments and banks to get these value\nexchange networks started to support\nthem regulate them and maintain them and\nthis gave those organizations a lot of\npower this is a critical aspect that the\ninternet and the blockchain are changing\nthe blockchain enables us to create\ntrusted and automated peer networks of\nexchange which greatly strengthens the\ncapacities of people to negotiate and\ndefine value via direct here to peer\nexchanges people can now set up their\nown currencies with the value of the\ncurrency depending simply on what others\nare willing to pay for it Veeran\nautomated peer-to-peer network exchange\nbut the internet of value is more than\njust currencies because value is of\ncourse a much broader concept than just\npure economic utility in talking about\nthe internet of value it's important to\nrecognize that on a societal level were\nmoving into a post-industrial services\neconomy the traditional conception of\nwhat society values is being revisited\nas a new set of societal and\nenvironmental factors re-enter the\nequation people are less and less\ncontent with the traditional concept of\nGDP as the sole metric for how well\nthey're doing and more and more\ndemanding actual quality of life which\nof course engenders a broader spectrum\nof values beyond economic utility over\nthe past decades we've increasingly\nbegun the process of tracking and\naccounting for different forms of value\nwhether this is green bonds social\nimpact bonds company loyalty schemes\ncarbon accounting or a multiplicity of\nother forms but simply the erosion and\nloss of social and environmental capital\nthat occurred during the Industrial Age\nis generating a recognition and growing\nawareness to their value metrics for how\nwell a society is doing increasingly\ntake account of many more environmental\nand social parameters in combination\nwith GDP along with this recognition to\nthe importance of different forms of\nvalue comes also the technical means the\nquantify an exchange them through the\nprocess of data fication information\ntechnology lets us measure track and\nexchange evermore types of value at ever\nsmaller increments likes on Facebook\npeople's attention carbon emissions etc\nwith the rise of big data and IOT will\nbe quantifying an ascribed value to\nalmost everything and the blockchain\nwill provide the network infrastructure\nfor tracking and exchanging all these\nmicro and macro quanta of value this\nshift from the narrow form of economic\nvalue that dominated in the Industrial\nAge to a broader spectrum of values that\nemerges within a post-industrial society\nis enabled by the\nTribute alleges system that supports\nwhat we call token economies wherein we\ncan define a token as a measure of any\nform of value and then built an economy\naround that token economies and the\ninternet of value built upon the current\nexpansion of digital markets brought\nabout by the rise of the platform\neconomy over the past decades with web\n2.0 we've begun the process of expanding\nmarkets to more and more spheres of life\nthat were previously organized via\ncentralized coordination after only ten\nyears or so of this process the biggest\naccommodation service in the worlds is\nno longer a centralized organization\nlike the Hilton it's now an online\nmarket the same is true for the taxi\nindustry the same is true for commerce\nwith 10 million merchants and 440\nmillion active users the Alibaba network\nis now reported as the largest retailer\nin the worlds after just 19 years of\nexistence markets are complex they\ntypically require the aggregation of\nlarge amounts of information and\npeer-to-peer interactions without the\ntechnology it is much more viable to\nachieve coordination very centralized\nhierarchical model but has become to\nquantify an account for more and more\nareas of life blockchain based networks\nwill expand the capacities of\nplug-and-play markets to all spheres of\nactivity social economic technological\nand environments on the Internet of\nvalue will function as the\ninfrastructure to the emergence of the\nservices economy which is currently\ntaking place within post-industrial\neconomies the move into a services\neconomy results in the conversion of\nindustrial age products into services\nwhereas the product based economic\nparadigm was about the production and\nconsumption of more products as measured\nby GDP a services economy is about value\ndelivered a service is an exchange of\nvalue you don't get the product you just\nget its function and the value that it\ndelivers\nas such all spheres of economy become\nredefined away from the static\nconception of units of products towards\nthe more fluid exchange of value\nyou don't buy lift to put in your office\nbuilding you get it as a service paying\nonly for the functional value it\ndelivers in some offices now they don't\neven buy the carpets on the floor the\nfunction of the carpet is delivered as a\nservice and they pay only for the value\nthat's exchanged the blockchain is a key\ninfrastructure enabling this services\neconomy as it requires a very fluid\ndynamic an automatic tracking an\nexchange of value smart property and\nsmart contracts will form the\ntechnological infrastructure powering\nthe services economy as they operate\nwithin large peer networks automatically\nallocating resources and processing the\nfinancial debits and credits of value\nexchanges behind the scenes this huge\nshift in our economy lets us\nreconceptualize every industry to really\nquestion what is the actual value that\nit delivers and then reconstructed by\nbuilding token markets around that value\nwhere anyone can participate in the\ndelivery of the service with web 2.0 and\nthe platform economy we extended the\ncapacities of markets so that many more\npeople could participate as exemplified\nby uber enabling anyone to operate as a\ndriver\nhowever these markets were centralized\naround the platform operators and they\nwere dependent on traditional currency\nsystems and the financial system for\nprocessing transactions in web 3.0\nblockchain applications will function as\ndistributed automatic plug-and-play\nmarkets were extremely small increments\nof value can be exchanged directly it\nappear with very high levels fluidity\nwhen this is coupled with IOT and data\nanalytics we'll be able to track the\nreal value that things deliver which\nwill help us to make the much-needed\nmove from our product based economies to\nan outcomes economy the better reflects\nthe underlying value being created in\nexchange\nwith the ongoing revolution in\nin technology our economic systems of\norganization are being transformed and\ndisrupted by the rise of information\nnetworks it started with the advent of\nthe personal computer World Wide Web and\nwith the rise of online platforms the\ndisruptive power of information networks\nto reshape economic organization became\never more apparent today this process of\neconomic transformation continues with a\nnew set of technologies as we are\ncurrently in the process of remaking the\ntechnology stack of the Internet\nbuilding what is called web 3.0 a\nprimary component of which is the\nblockchain the defining feature of this\nnext stage of economic development is\nthat it decentralizes our economy and\nshifts operations to global information\nbased networks like never before\nthis distributed internet technology\nstack that is currently being built\nenables a network of computers to\nmaintain a collective database of value\nownership and exchanges via internet\nprotocols this bookkeeping is neither\nclosed nor the control of one party\nrather it is public and available in one\ndigital ledger which is distributed\nacross the network the most mature\nexample of this is what we call the\nblockchain in the blockchain all\ntransactions are logged including\ninformation on the date time\nparticipants and amount of every single\ntransaction on the basis of\nsophisticated mathematical principles\nthe transactions are verified by the so\ncalled miners who run the computing\ninfrastructure required to maintain the\nLedger's\nthe technology of web 3.0 enables a new\nform of decentralized economy as it\nremoves the dependency on a centralized\nauthority for managing the network\ninstead replacing it with a distributed\nconsensus model managed by many this\nshared securely encrypted database\nenables trustless peer-to-peer\ninteractions via new internet protocols\npeople can begin to set up their own\nnetworks for coordination and direct\nexchanges of value peer-to-peer and it\nenables the rules of these transactions\nto be automated in new ways\nat the heart of this system is the\ndistributed ledger which records the\nexchanges of value these distributed\nLedger's can account for and validate\nthe exchange of any form of value it may\nbe a currency it may be property it may\nbe a kilowatt hour of energy the usage\nof a parking spot the number of\nfollowers a person has on social media\nthese distributed Ledger's provide the\ninfrastructure for building token\neconomies a token is simply a quantified\nunit of value tokens are both generic\nand fungible it is generic in that it\ncan be used to define any form of value\nand it is fungible meaning it is\nexchangeable between different specific\nforms of value\ntraditional monetary currencies are not\nfully fungible as there are many\ncircumstances when one cannot exchange a\nmonetary currency for other forms of\nvalue for example likes on social media\nmay have a certain value but typically\ncannot be directly exchanged for\nmonetary currencies\na token differs from our traditional\nmonetary currency and that it is more\ngeneric our existing currencies define a\nparticular type of monetary value what\nwe call utility which is based upon the\neconomic logic of the industrial economy\nwhile tokens because they are more\ngeneric can define a broader set of\nvalues social capital natural capital or\ncultural capital for example natural\ncapital is the integrity of an ecosystem\nthat enables it to function and provide\necosystems services to people in our\ntraditional economic model we only\nquantify and account for the services\nthat the ecosystem delivers such as food\nwater materials etc however we do not\naccount for the integrity of the\necosystem that enables it to function\nthe generic nature of the token means it\ncan be used to account for values such\nas this natural capital\nthe capacity to differentiate between\ndifferent forms of value is made\npossible by the programmability of token\nunits because tokens are digital\nthey are also programmable which enables\none to specify certain rules for that\ntoken and have those rules executed when\nit is exchanged thus enabling certain\nconstraints or possibilities in its\nusage one can specify that a certain\ntoken is only spendable under certain\nterms or specify how it can be converted\nfor example one could program the token\nso that it cannot be exchanged for\ndiamonds that are mined in a particular\nlocation of the world known for its use\nof slave labor in this way the token is\nnot just a unit of utility but also\nexpresses social values\nlikewise one could create a health care\nallowance in dollars or Euros that could\nbe programmed on the blockchain so that\nit can only be used to pay for health\ncare at certified parties automating\nthese measures leads to a considerable\ndecrease in bureaucracy this\nprogrammable token system works to shift\nour economies from a single value model\nto a multi value model they create many\ndifferent types of value and economies\nbut still retain the possibility for\nexchange between them\nthe distributed web is the convergence\nof the economic market system with\ninformation technology that enables us\nto convert traditional organizations\ninto distributed markets based on tokens\ntokens define whatever is a value within\nthat organization and the market system\nis used as a distributed coordination\nmechanism for managing and growing that\nresource\nby creating an expanded definition of\nvalue and converting closed\norganizations into open markets this\nmeans that we can vastly expand the\nscope and capacities of the economy the\nprovisioning of services within the\neconomy no longer becomes dependent upon\na limited number of centralized\norganizations acting for profit but\ninstead anyone can now provide the\nservice via these open protocols this\nmeans we can harness the resources of\nthe many in a distributed fashion\ninstead of being dependent upon a few\nlikewise the token economy can harness\nthe motives of individuals not just for\nfinancial rewards but for a multiplicity\nof values\nto illustrate how this works let's think\nabout the service of cloud data storage\ncurrently this is provided by a limited\nnumber of enterprises like Amazon and\nMicrosoft these centralized\norganizations have huge data centers but\nstill those data centers are only a very\nsmall fraction of the storage capacity\nin the world most of the storage is in\nthe personal computing devices of\nend-users and most of that is not being\nused a file coin is one organization\nthat works to create a distributed token\neconomy for this storage file coin is a\ndecentralized storage network that turns\ncloud storage into an algorithmic market\nthe market runs on a blockchain with a\nnative protocol token also called file\ncoin which miners earned by providing\nstorage to clients\nconversely clients spend file coins\nhiring miners to store or distribute\ndata the sum of all these computers that\nare coordinated through an automatic\nmarket system on the blockchain can\nprovide a much larger more resilient\nsystem than the centralized model while\nreducing redundancy and inefficiencies\nin the overall system it also pushes the\nprovision of the service out to the\nlocation where it is demanded as people\nare connecting peer-to-peer locally\ninstead of going to the centralized\nserver that may be on the other side of\nthe planet\ntokens such as file coins can be\nexchanged for other currencies or\nmembers can hold on to their tokens\nwhose value may appreciate as the\nnetworks grow over time\nthis illustrates a very interesting\naspect to tokens anyone who uses the\nsystem is also an investor in the system\nthus tokens merge investment capital and\nliquid exchange capital in new ways in\nthe traditional capitalist model we have\na divide between owners of capital and\nworkers a divide between a more fixed\ninvestment capital and liquid exchange\ncurrencies the shares in a company are\nnot the same thing as what people get\npaid with for working in that enterprise\nand use for everyday exchanges in the\nmarket this creates the notorious divide\nwithin the industrial economy described\nby Karl Marx between the capitalists\nthat make money off their investments in\nthe workers that have to stay selling\ntheir labor for money without ownership\ntokens represent both the inherent value\nof the community which is its capital\ninvestment and they are also units of\nexchange within that ecosystem the\nfounders of the project issue a number\nof tokens at inception and sell those\nfor someone to use the system they have\nto buy the tokens in so doing they\nbecome part investors in the project but\nthey also use those same tokens to make\nexchanges within the market thus the\npeople creating the value in the\necosystem are also getting paid in\ntokens meaning the workers that are\ncreating the value through their work\nalso have ownership within the\norganization\nin the traditional utility-based\nexchange of cash people have no\nownership in the organization they just\ntry to make money and this can create\ndivides between the owners and the users\nthe token system works to better align\nthe incentives of the individuals with\nthe overall system because the value of\nthe tokens they earn is also dependent\nupon the value of the whole when you are\nworking for a token network you are both\nworking for yourself and for the whole\norganization as the to become more\naligned unlike the traditional divide\nbetween capitalist and worker\nthe token system enables networks to\novercome the chicken-and-egg problem if\nyou are the first user of a network like\neBay then the value would be very low\nthus it is difficult to get the network\nstarted because it has to reach a\ncritical mass before it will be of value\nto the users this means that it may\nrequire a large investment to create a\nnetwork the Silicon Valley model worked\nby having large initial venture capital\nbacking that enables them to overcome\nthis but it means that most networks\ndon't get off the ground and that once a\nnetwork reaches scale and has value it\nbecomes dominant and very difficult to\ncompete with resulting in a lock-in\neffect and making it easy for large\nincumbent organizations to become\nextractive over time it also means that\nthose who founded the organization win\nbig time if the network takes off it\ncreates a winner-takes-all dynamic with\nmost people losing because of the\nthreshold\nthe token system extends the benefits of\nbeing an early adopter of a new network\nto all the users and thus helps to solve\nthis issue it does this by issuing\ntokens for anyone to purchase at the\nbeginning of the project as the project\ngrows the tokens come to have greater\nvalue for all of the holders\nthis also works to make the users of the\nnetwork promoters of that organization\nbecause as it grows the tokens that they\nhold become more valuable it\nincentivizes people to join networks\nearly so as to gain the benefits of the\nincrease in their token value as it\ngrows which reduces the problem of\nthresholds with this technology\ncompanies no longer have to go to\ntraditional capital markets through an\ninitial public offering of shares in the\ncompany in exchange for money but\ninstead they simply sell tokens directly\non the Internet to raise initial capital\nfor the project in what is called an\ninitial coin offering or IC o----\nthis means that founders can monetize\ntheir networks directly by simply\nholding their tokens and making the\nnetwork useful\nto date we have had an Internet patched\nonto the side of an economy operated\nthrough the many centralized\norganizations of the Industrial Age\ncreating a strong contradiction between\nthe underlying technology and the\ninstitutional arrangements the\ndistributed web will work to transform\nthis by merging information networks and\neconomic organization as the flow of\ninformation an economic value becomes\none this will greatly reduce our\ndependency on centralized organizations\nexpanding markets as systems of\norganization the global market economy\nwill become available to the many\nthrough small distributed peer-to-peer\ninteractions running through web\nprotocols as the decentralized internet\ntakes us a step further into the\nnetworked economy\n[Music]\n",
