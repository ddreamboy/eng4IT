  "text": "this short video deals with an ethical\naspect of AI and it's something that I\nthink is important for all of us to\nreally think about and start to\nunderstand that there's lots of gray\nareas associated with AI but at the very\nleast it's important for us to have some\nawareness and then for us to think about\nthese things as well as to pose them to\nour students and to have them think\nabout it because that is a great and\npowerful way to help develop their care\nitical thinking so this deals with the\nidea of the data that AI is using in\norder to develop its large language\nmodels specifically open AI right\nthey're they're sort of the main\nplayers here we go in looking at the the\nmany different lawsuits that are going\non right now because open AI has used\nall this data throughout the internet\nwithout permissions from a lot of those\ndifferent sources initially you have to\nthink that oh okay this is this is wrong\nif they don't have permission to do\nsomething then they can't just be taking\nit on some levels yes and no because if\nsomeone is simply reading a book well\nthey're observing that and they're\nlearning from that regardless of where\nthat book is because yes it's\ncopyrighted material but I could have\nchecked it out from library uh I could\nhave read it at a bookstore so now\nthere's a little bit of gray area there\nright because they're not regurgitating\nit word for word no it's just simply\nbeing used as a training aspect so\nthat's an argument that could be made\nnow another argument that open AI is\nspecifically making about this uh comes\nfrom from a journal here I want to read\nspecifically what it states this is from\nAI news and it states that open AI made\nwaves this week with its bold assertion\nto a UK parliamentary committee that it\nwould be impossible to develop today's\nleading AI system systems without using\nvast amounts of copyrighted material in\nwritten testimony open aai stated that\nbetween expansive copyright laws and the\nubiquity of protected online content\nvirtually every sort of human expression\nwould be off limits for training data\nfrom news articles to Forum comments to\ndigital images little online content can\nbe utilized freely and legally according\nto open AI attempts to create capable AI\nwhile avoiding copyright infringement\nwould fail limiting training data to\npublic domain books and drawings created\nmore than a century ago would not\nprovide AI systems that meet the needs\nof today's citizens so that's an\ninteresting take and it does make a lot\nof sense in that if we want uh an AI\nthat has modern capabilities modern\nunderstanding well it needs to be\ntrained on Modern data so now we have\nagain this uh this situation where in\norder for it to to be this capable AI it\nneeds access to to everything basically\nin order to be able to give us this type\nof information this modern upto-date\ncurrent information so as a society we\nreally need to be thinking about that as\nfar as\ncopyright AI open AI they're working\nwith a lot of different Publishers to\ntry and come up with you know payments\nthat they'll give them for access to\nsome of that but that won't cover\neverything\nthroughout the entire internet so it's\ngoing to be something to really think\nabout again to analyze as far as the\nethical implications whether that's\nright that's wrong what about the\ngreater good all these things really\nneed to come into play and again there\ncan be multiple truths this is right and\nso is this but what about the overall\nright and wrong of this I don't have all\nthe answers but I want to bring this out\nso that this is something that we\ncontinually talk about uh here with\nacademics but again this is something\nreally important that should be brought\nup to the students as well have them\nreally think about this come up with\npros and cons some ideas that really\nsupport this some ideas that might be\nagainst this this is where critical\nthinking comes in this is where deep\nlearning comes in by having some more uh\nemotional connection to this and then by\nthinking about this on a deeper level\nfor both sides because there are\narguments to be made for both sides so\nby looking deeper into the the ethical\naspects of of open AI of AI in general\nhow generative AI has developed and will\ncontinue to develop that really will\nhelp students and will help Academia in\ngeneral and remember learning is for\n[Music]\nlife thank you and if You' made it this\nfar and you've gotten some good use out\nof this content please consider liking\nsharing and subscribing I really\nappreciate\nit\n",
