  "text": "so you want to learn artificial\nintelligence then this video is for you\nI'm going to provide you with a complete\nroadmap that I would follow if I had to\nstart over today on my artificial\nintelligence journey and now for context\nI started studying artificial\nintelligence back in 2013 10 years ago\nand over the past years I've been\nworking as a freelance data scientist\nhelping my clients with various\nend-to-end data science and artificial\nintelligence Solutions and applications\nI also share all of this knowledge and\nmy journey on this YouTube channel which\nas of today has over 25 000 subscribers\nand at the end of this video I will also\nprovide you with a resource completely\nfor free where you can follow all of\nthese steps to complete roadmap even\nwith training videos and instructions so\nmake sure to stick around for that and\nnow before we dive into the seven steps\nthat I would take today to go from\nbeginner all the way to monetizing my\ndata and AI skills it's important to\nprovide some context on what is\ncurrently going on with the AI hype\nbecause I see a lot of new people\nentering the field and for a good reason\nbecause the AI Market size is expected\nto grow up to 20 volt by the year 2030\nbringing it all the way to nearly 2\ntrillion US dollars so it's really one\nof the best opportunities I would say\nright now to get into because we're\nstill early we're still at the beginning\nof this AI Revolution and also with the\nrelease of these pre-trained models from\nopen AI it's now also easier than ever\nto enter the field but that said that is\nalso where a lot of the misunderstanding\nand just wrong expectations arise from\nbecause I see a lot of people online as\nwell as on YouTube explaining like how\nyou can quickly start for example your\nown AI automation agency and while there\nare great tools already online out there\nlike both press and stack Ai and\nflowwise which I also made a video on\nwhere you can quickly spin up prototypes\nand and simple Bots and even can get a\nlittle bit more advanced don't get me\nwrong you can definitely build some\ngreat Solutions with that but if you\nreally want to learn artificial\nintelligence and build applications that\ncompanies can count on and build upon\nthen you really have to understand the\ncoding part the technical part really of\nit so that's really where our starting\npoint should be for you and for your\nlearning path figuring out hey do I want\nto just learn how to use these no code\nLoco tools already available or do I\nreally want to learn artificial\nintelligence and with that said there is\nalso just a general misunderstanding I\nbelieve of what really AI is because AIS\nis such a large umbrella term and it's\nalso nothing new it's been around since\nthe 1950s but right now with the chat\nGPT hype and the open AI models people\nthink AI is that really if we look at\nwhat artificial intelligence really is\nit's like I've said a real big umbrella\nterm with various subfields so for\nexample within artificial intelligence\nwhich is here explained as programs with\nthe ability to learn and reason like\nhumans machine learning then we have\ndeep learning which is another subset\nfocusing on neural networks and then we\nhave the field of data science but in my\nwork as a data scientist I use\nartificial intelligence I use machine\nlearning and I also use deep learning\nit's a lot more than what people think\nthe first real question that you gotta\nask yourself is do you want to be a\ncoder and now there's no right or wrong\nanswer here there are plenty of\nopportunities right now and also in the\nfuture for both Pathways for both local\nNOCO tools and building custom\napplications but you just gotta be aware\nof the pros and cons to both of the\nsides and not to be totally clear this\nroadmap is for people that really want\nto learn AI with the depth of\nunderstanding really learn the technical\nside of things and now if you've decided\nthat that is not for you that's of\ncourse totally fine like I said there's\nno right or wrong but then if you want\nto still want to do things with AI then\nI recommend starting out by checking out\nboth press like I've set or stack AI\nwhich are excellent resources or you\ncould check out my video on flowwise\nhere on YouTube where I show you how you\ncan get started with a local NOCO 2 as\nwell completely for free but if you do\ndecide that you want to join the Dark\nSide and become a coder then let's\nproceed with the next steps my Approach\nis quite different from anything else\nyou will find online and now why is that\nand what I typically see online is you\nhave two ends of the the Spectrum\nbasically where on the one hand you have\nthe people talking about these low code\nand no code tools not really getting\ninto the specific the theoretical part\nand then on the other hand you have the\nmore classical approaches towards\nartificial intelligence and machine\nlearning where people really get into\nthe mathematics and the statistics\ngiving you road maps where you really\nhave to get theoretical first I'm a firm\nbeliever of learning by doing reverse\nengineering things that people have\nalready done putting in practice and\nthen trying to fill in the gaps now the\ntechnical roadmap that I'm going to\nprovide to you will really focus on the\nfundamentals that you need in order to\nget started in either artificial\nintelligence data science or anything in\nbetween like I've said I've worked in\nall of these fields over the past 10\nyears and I've really identified the\ncore techniques workflows and tools that\nyou need in order to get started\nregardless of what you want to do so\nthis will work for you if you just want\nto build applications with large\nlanguage models and Lang chain for\nexample but it will also work if you\naspire to become a data scientist or a\nmachine learning engineer now the actual\nfirst step that I would focus on on my\nAI Journey would be to set up my work\nenvironment now what does this mean so\npython is the go-to language that we\nhave to learn if you want to get started\nin AI or in data science but the thing\nis\nTitan if you start to follow these\ntutorials online videos training videos\ncourses even you can quite quickly\nunderstand Python and how it works\nbecause it's one of the easiest\nlanguages to get started with but I\nfound in my personal Journey that\nthere's this initial bump where you see\nthings online and you see people run\nsome code but then you are missing some\ninformation on okay but how do I now\nactually do this on my laptop on my\ncomputer\nand I would really focus on this first\nsetting up an environment on your laptop\non your computer where you have an\napplication a program and a python\ninstallation that you are confident with\nand now I have a specific approach that\nI take over here within fias code and a\nlot of people seem to like that so make\nsure to check that out in the resources\nbut this really is step one they're\ngetting accustomed with that and that\nbrings us then to step two which is\nactually getting started with python\nit's like I said the most important\nlanguage this is going to be your tool\nthat you're going to build these\napplications in now if you're new to\nprogramming at all I would first focus\non the fundamentals of programming which\nI will have resources to but then\nquickly transition into learning the\nbasics of python and then specifically\nsome libraries that are very useful for\nAI and data science in particular so\nthese would be for example the numpy AI\nLibrary the pandas library and the matte\nplus lib library now these are all\nlibraries that you can use to do data\nmanipulation data cleaning creating\nvisualizations this is really your\nstarting point for starting to work with\ndata because in the end all AI\napplications all AI tools are created\nfrom data with data so being able to\nwork with data and turn raw and\nunstructured data into information into\nvaluable insights that you can actually\ndo something with is is really at the\ncore of of artificial intelligence and\nnow step three would be to learn the\nvery basics of git and GitHub now why is\nthat some would argue that that would be\na little bit more advanced and it's not\nrequired in the beginning but what I've\nfound especially with artificial\nintelligence and also the video\ntutorials that I make is that a lot of\nexamples online people will make that\ncode available via GitHub but you have\nto understand kind of at the very base\nsick how these tools work because that\nallows you to easily copy and clone is\nwhat they call it tutorials that brings\nus to step 4 which is working on\nprojects and building a portfolio and\nfor this it's convenient if you already\nknow how to use git so you can download\nsome projects download some code from\nfrom other people and then try to\nreverse engineer it to me that really is\nthe best way to to Learn Python to get\ngood to actually understand holistically\nwhat a project looks like how people are\nstructuring their code and trying to run\nit and then you don't understand what's\ngoing on but then trying to reverse\nengineer so it's really like beginning\nwith the end in mind and then trying to\nchange things and see how that affects\nthe different outcomes and this also\nprovides you with an opportunity to\nexplore what it is specifically that you\nlike about artificial intelligence all\nthe areas we've discussed computer\nvision natural language processing\nmachine learning he here you really find\nout okay these are all the kinds of\nthings that I can do and this is really\nwhat I like to do and then as you're\nworking on these projects selecting them\npicking them you there will be a lot of\ngaps and and things you don't understand\nand that would be a good point if you're\ninterested in that to find specific\npieces of information or courses to help\nyou with just that and now when it comes\nto projects probably the best place to\nstart if you want to learn more about\ndata science and machine learning is\nkaggle so kaggle is an excellent\nresource that you can go through and\nthey host machine learning competitions\nhere so you can see all kinds of\nrequests and you can even win prizes so\nthis is one from Google and the cool\nthing here is if you click on the actual\ncompetition you can also actually have a\nlook at submissions that people have\nmade so here you can see an entire\nnotebook from someone\nthat is trying to solve this problem for\nGoogle all with documentation and and\neven the code so this is such an\nexcellent learning resources source that\nyou can go through like I said there are\nplenty plenty of resources available on\nhere but if that's not for you machine\nlearning data science if you want to\njust explore large language models in\nopen AI for example right now then I\nrecommend to check out my GitHub\nrepository on Lang chain experiments so\nI also have videos on my YouTube channel\nfor that but here on the repository\nthat's why it's good that you at least\nunderstand the basics of git and GitHub\nso you can take this code know how to\nwork with it so here are some cool\nexamples of how you connect can create a\nYouTube bot that can summarize a video\nor even a slack bolt or a Ponders agent\nthat can ask questions and answer\nquestions about large data tables and\nnow if you're really serious about\nlearning artificial intelligence and\ndata science and another great resource\nthat you can check out is Project Pro\nwhich I've recently discovered so\nproject Pro is a curated library of\nverified and solved end-to-end project\nSolutions in data science machine\nlearning and big data so overall this is\njust an excellent resource with with so\nmuch information and all the projects on\nhere that you can pick from all from the\nvarious fields are all created by top\nindustry experts from leading tech\ncompanies so what I really like about\nthis is first of all you have about 3\n000 free recipes that like anyone can\ncheck out but if you get to the\nsubscription and that is why it really\ngets interesting you have access to 250\nplus end-to-end projects so you can\nreally like go in here and see okay what\nis it that you're working on so maybe\nit's data science and you want to\nspecialize in machine learning and you\ngo in here you literally have all kinds\nof projects and this is not only a great\nresource for you to learn from because\nyou will have complete video\nwalkthroughs 24 7 support and you can\nask questions and and you can even\ndownload all of the code so literally\nthe entire project will be made\navailable to you so it's a excellent\nLearning Resource but also for me\npersonally working as a freelance data\nscientist this can also like really help\nme in my professional work that the\nprojects that I take on so for you that\ncould either be in your job or in future\njobs freelancing whatever you really\nhave a library that you can pick from\nthat can really give you that extra kind\nof confidence you need for example to\ntake on a project now like I've said\nreally you see video instructions you\ncan go through everything and then also\ndownload the code so this really is a\ngreat resource that you can check out\nand if you want to learn more about this\nI will leave a link down in the\ndescription and project Pro also has a\nYouTube channel which you can subscribe\nto if you want to stay in the loop learn\nmore on that and that brings us to step\nfive which is picking your\nspecialization and sharing your\nknowledge so right now you understand\nthe fundamentals of python you have a\nwork environment and some some efficient\nworkflows that you can follow you also\nhave some project experience so now you\nget a little bit more clarity of what it\nis that you want to do within the world\nof AI or data science or machine\nlearning so this would be the point\nwhere you pick a focus area you\nspecialize you try to learn more and\nalso what I really would recommend and\nwhat I would do is to start sharing your\nknowledge so you could do this through a\npersonal blog you could do this through\nwriting articles on medium or towards\ndata science or you could even\npotentially like I'm doing share your\nyour knowledge on YouTube and by doing\nso you're not only contributing to the\ncollective knowledge on AI and data\nscience but it's also an essential\nmethod for you to strengthen your own\nlearning because in doing so in\nexplaining Concepts that you're working\non that you're learning to to someone\nelse you really start to identify the\ngaps within your understanding and this\nagain allows you to fill in those gaps\naccordingly and really focus on some\nspecialized learning versus just going\nthrough course after course after course\nand then step six would be continue to\nlearn and upskill because now that you\nhave Clarity on your specialization and\nkind of the direction that you want to\ngo and you also start to identify these\ngaps within your own understanding\nit might be time for you to for example\nfocus on math focus on statistics if you\nwant to become a better machine learning\nengineer or a data scientist but if\nyou've decided to go with the large\nlanguage model and generative AI route\nyou might identify that you need some\nsoftware engineering skills actually\nreally start to understand how you can\nwork with with apis and create\napplications and that's like I think the\nmain main message that I wanna want to\nprovide you with with regards to this\nroadmap and and my Approach is that it's\neveryone's journey is is unique and\ndepending on what you want to do with AI\nthere's a specialized learning path for\nyou specifically so my goal is to really\nprovide you with the tools and\ntechniques to quickly get going\nget your hands dirty identify problems\nwork on projects and then fill in those\ngaps and then finally step 7 would be to\nmonetize your skills now this could\neither be through a job this could be\nthrough freelancing or this could be\nthrough building a product but where the\nreal Learning Happens is is when there\nreally is some pressure onto it so it's\nall fun and games when you're trying to\nexplore this within your free time\nfollowing some courses following some\ntutorials but when it's your boss or\nwhen it's a client that's that's\nbreathing down your neck for the\ndeadline that is where you really push\nyourself that is where you really get\ncreative get resourceful and try to\nabsorb and learn as much information as\npossible to just get the job done and\nthat's it those are the seven steps that\nI would take today if I had to start\nover completely from scratch on my AI\nJourney and now another bonus tip that I\ncan provide you which will make a great\ndifference is surround yourself with\nlike-minded individuals who are on the\nsame track the same path as you who\nshare the same interest where you can\nbounce ideas off where you can share the\nlatest news and tips with and in order\nto facilitate that for you as well I\nhave an exciting announcement because\ntoday I will officially be releasing my\nfree group called Data alchemy that I\nwould like you all to invite you this\nwill be a group where I not only share\nthe complete and entire roadmap that I\njust shared with you with all the links\nresources tools it will also be a hub\nyour go-to place to navigate the world\nof data science and artificial\nintelligence and everything that's going\non and happening right now within this\nrapidly changing field so if you're\nserious about learning artificial\nintelligence and data science and you\nalso also want access to not only this\nentire roadmap but additional courses\nand resources then make sure to check\nout the first link in the pinned comment\nbelow this video and then I look forward\nto seeing you in the group\nforeign\n",
