  "text": "ever wondered how companies know what\nyou think about them well they can't\nread mins but they can read your tweets\nemails reviews and pretty much\neverything else you write online and\nthis is where sentiment analysis comes\nin sentiment analysis involves analyzing\nlarge volumes of text to determine the\nsentiment expressed to see if it's\npositive or negative or somewhere in\nbetween like neutral and it's intended\nto help companies better understand\ntheir customers to deliver stronger\ncustomer experiences and improve their\nbrand\nreputation but it's not without its\npitfalls okay so let's get into this and\nsentiment analysis is built on top of\nsomething called\nNLP natural language processing to train\nsoftware to analyze and interpret text\nin a way that mimics human understanding\nand there are a couple of main\napproaches to this there's rule based\nand then there's machine learning based\nand then sometimes you'll see a hybrid\nof the two and let's start with rule\nbased so what about the rule based\napproach to sentiment analysis well in\nthis approach software is trained to\nclassify certain keywords in a block of\ntext based on groups of words or what\nare\ncalled\nlexicons and lexicons are groupings of\nwords that describe the author's intent\nso for example let's consider some some\nlexicons so\naffordable would be one uh wellmade\nwould be another one uh perhaps we might\nconsider fast as another lexicon what do\nthey all have in common well they would\nall be in the positive lexicon so we can\ngive this a big happy smiley face but\nthen we could say things like expensive\nor we could say poorly made or we could\nsay slow and yes clearly these would all\nbe\nconsidered the sad face these would be\nconsidered negative\nlexicons now the software scans the text\nfor these keywords and then calculates a\nsentiment score based on the frequency\nand the context of these words so if we\nlook at this review here that says these\nshoes are affordable well and shipping\nwas fast well that scores highly in the\npositive lexicon and can be considered\nan overall positive\nsentiment boy this is easy there is no\nway the nuances of human language will\never get in the way of us assigning\nsentiment scores right well that that is\na fine example of sarcasm and sarcasm\ncan really trip up sentiment analysis\nsystems it can be real problem\nespecially for the rule-based approach\nto sentiment analysis so consider this\nreview oh wonderful a pair of shoes so\nwellmade they lasted me one full week a\nrule-based system might pick up on\nwonderful and wellmade as being in the\npositive lexicon category and then\nmisclassify the overall sentiment as\npositive missing the sarcastic tone\nentirely but sarcasm that's just one\nexample another one is\nnegation now negation can really trip\nthese things up as well if we take the\nsentence I wouldn't say the shoes were\ninexpensive uh well the word inexpensive\nthat might typically signal a positive\nsentiment in a alexicon but here it's\nused in a negated form to imply the\nshoes are actually a little bit\nexpensive so without understanding the\ncontext a rules based system might\nmisinterpret the sentiment and then\nthere's\nalso idiomatic language which can trip\nthings up as well so if we think about\nphrases like break a leg or it's a piece\nof cake uh they don't literally mean\nwhat the words suggest so if somebody\nwrites at this price the shoes are a\nsteel a rule based system might\nincorrectly assume theft based\nnegativity instead of understanding that\nit means the shoes were a great\nbargain okay so what about the other\ntype of approach and that is\nmachine learning the machine learning\napproach to sentiment analysis now that\nhelps tackle some of these issues by\ntraining algorithms on large data sets\nto recognize patterns including the\ncomplexities of human language and\ndevelopers use sentiment analysis\nalgorithms to teach software how to\nidentify emotion in text simply the same\nway that humans do now that's performed\ntypically using classification\nalgorithms and let's take a look at a\ncouple of classif application algorithms\nnow so we'll start with the first one\nwhich is called\nlinear regression and linear regression\nis a pretty common classification\nalgorithm that in this case predicts a\nsentiment score based on various\nfeatures in the text so for example to\ndetermine the sentiment of product\nreviews it considers the frequency of\npositive and negative words but also the\nreview length and specific emotive\nphrases uh another one we can use\nis naive base and this uses base theorem\nto classify text by calculating the\nprobability of a sentiment based on word\noccurrences so for instance if we have a\ndata set of restaurant reviews already\nlabeled as positive or negative then\nthis algorithm calculates the likelihood\nthat a new review is positive or\nnegative based on the words it contains\nand another one is svm that is support\nVector machines and there are fast and\neffective classification algorithm used\nto solve two group classification\nproblems so to classify customer reviews\nas positive or negative spvm identifies\nthe optimal boundary that separates the\ntwo groups and it does that by analyzing\nfeatures like word frequencies and\nphrases ensuring the maximum margin\nbetween the positive and the negative\nreviews now together these approaches\ncan help weed out the sarcasm negation\nand idiomatic language expressed in\nhuman generated\nall right now depending on their needs\norganizations can use various types of\nsentiment analysis to get a clearer\npicture of customer sentiments and we're\ngoing to look at a few types and they\nall rely on the software's ability to\ngauge something that is known as\npolarity now polarity is the the the\noverall feeling conveyed by a piece of\ntext and it can be generally described\non a scale so we have positive at one\nend\nneutral in the\nmiddle and negative at the other end and\nthen some models take it even further\ncategorizing text into subcategories\nlike extremely positive and\nextremely negative so we have a scale\nhere that we can rank things on all\nright so let's consider a few of these\nand we're going to start with\nfine grain\nso this is a type of sentiment analysis\nuh also known as graded and sentiment\nanalysis groups text into different\nemotions here and the level of emotion\nbeing expressed so polarity here\nactually is often expressed as a\nnumerical rating on a scale of 0 to 100\nwhere Zer is neutral and then 100\nrepresents the most extreme sentiment\nthere's also also aspect based sentiment\nanalysis so a\nBSA and Narrows the focus to specific\naspects of a product or of a service or\nof a customer experience so for example\nlike a budget travel app might use Absa\nto analyze user feedback specifically\nabout its new customer chatbot this\nhelps businesses understand precisely\nwhat customers like or dislike about\nparticular features allowing them to\naddress those specific issues and\nthere's\nalso\nemotional detection as a different type\nof sentiment analysis and this seeks to\nunderstand the psychological state of\nthe individual behind a body of text\nincluding their frame of mind when they\nwere writing it and their intentions\nit's more complex than either fine grain\nor Absa and it's typically used to gain\na deeper understanding of a person's\nmotivation or their emotional state so\nfor example a support ticket saying\nsomething like I'm extremely frustrated\nby the repeated issues I mean that\nreveals not just negative sentiment but\nit also reveals Le specific emotion of\nfrustration so rather than using\npolarities like positive negative or\nneutral emotional detection can identify\nspecific emotions in a body of text the\ncore idea here is that by building an\nunderstanding of sentiment as it relates\nto a customer's overall experience\nspecific features and underlying emotion\nan organization will be empowered to\nmake meaningful changes so for example\nto learn which issues to escalate in a\nsupport Forum or to conduct market\nresearch on competitive to spot Trends\nand identify New Opportunities\nultimately sentiment analysis is a tool\nto extract meaningful analysis to guide\nbusiness decisions when done right\nsentiment analysis can walk the line of\nhuman Nuance turning even the trickiest\nreviews yeah even the most sarcastic\nones into clear\ninsights if you have any questions\nplease drop us a line below and if you\nwant to see more videos like this in the\nfuture
