  "text": "This cybersecurity tool is\namazing. You need to deploy it.\nNot only is it free and open source,\nwhich I don't know how that's possible,\nbut you're gonna learn so much about\nhacking and security while also protecting\nyour stuff. It's a no-brainer.\nI deployed the server in about five\nminutes and then deployed agents to all of\nmy computers and servers,\nMac, windows, Lennox.\nNow these agents are like the tattletales\nin school. They tell me everything.\nThings like security configuration\nare all my devices misconfigured?\nI don't know, but I do Now it'll check\nfor known vulnerabilities, malware,\nand then this is kind of nuts.\nIt can track a directory and see if any\nchanges occurred, files added removed,\ndocuments edited, and\nthis is even crazier.\nIt can track the changes to the\nWindows registry. Are you kidding me?\nIt's amazing.\nSo all these devices send all the\ninformation to my server and I can see\neverything from one\nlocation. I get alerts,\nwhich can come at me via\nemail or Slack or whatever.\nI can do things in response to\nthose alerts. Active response.\nSo not only can I detect a brute force\nattack, I can do something about it.\nBlock that IP, address. This\nserver or this tool is called waza.\nIt's a type of cybersecurity\ntool called asim,\nsecurity Information and Event Management.\nBut I so badly wanna call it a siem.\nI'm gonna call it a siem. I don't care.\nThis type of tool is what the blue team\nor defensive side of cybersecurity will\nuse to defend against the bad guys to\nstop the hackers. So on this video,\nI'm gonna show you how to deploy this\ncuz you need to. It's amazing. Again,\nnot only will you be\nprotecting your stuff,\nbut you're gonna learn so much and it's\nalso kind of addicting. And seriously,\nthis is something you could probably put\non your resume. This is a project like,\nhey, I run my own seam,\nsim seam seam seams.\nPretty cool, doesn't it? ,\nI That was lame. I'm sorry.\nSo you're convinced, let's talk about\nwhat you need. Really only two things.\nA Linux server or computer and something\nto monitor. So other computers,\nmost flavors of Lennox are supported.\nI'll be installing it on Ubuntu.\nAnd more specifically, I'll be on a cloud\nmachine in ano. That's what I prefer.\nSo I can monitor everything with\nease and also it's ridiculously easy.\nI'll walk you through it here in\na bit. But it can also be on-prem,\non a server you already have. Or\nit can be on a Docker container.\nLemme get some room here, already\ngot a room, scoot down. There we go.\nAnd they even have an ova for\neasy deployment on virtual box.\nNow as far as system\nrequirements for the Wza server,\nlemme show you what they\nrecommend. At minimum,\nthey want two gigs of RAM and two CPU\ncores. That'll work for most people.\nIf you got a lot of devices, if you're\ngonna be collecting lots of logs,\nyou wanna go larger. Four gigs of\nRam and eight CPU cores. Now again,\nI'm gonna walk you through the cloud\noption and then also sprinkle in a little\nbit of dog or two just for fun. Oh,\nalmost forgot the most important thing.\nCoffee. Everything in it requires\ncoffee. It's just the rules.\nNetwork.\nChuck.coffee first. All we'll set\nup. Waza or wsu, I'm not sure.\nI'm just gonna call it waza in the cloud.\nSo let's head on over to od.com/network\nchuck or check the link below.\nNow not only is LY node\nthe sponsor of this video,\nbut they are my favorite cloud provider.\nLike I'm not lying, check this up.\nI have way too many virtual machines in\nthe cloud because I just go in here and\nspin up something.\nAnytime I have a project,\nanytime I wanna mess with\nsomething, I just go to LE Node,\nspin up a quick virtual machine in\nseconds. Now if you're new to LE Node,\nthis is gonna be free for\nyou. For the first 60 days,\nthey're gonna give you $100 credit\nto go crazy and play around with it.\nSo if you haven't already,\ngo ahead and get signed up right now\nand then get signed in and meet me back\nhere.\nNow the other reason I love Le Node is\nthey make deploying virtual machines like\nwaza. Super stinking easy. Check this\nout. I'm gonna go to create Lin node.\nI'll click on Marketplace and then\nI'll search for waza. There it is.\nLet's go and click on that and just\nhave it selected and we'll scroll down a\nbit.\nNow time for just a little bit of config\nFirst put an email address then for the\nSSL certificate. Then a limited\npseudo user account, Bernard hack.\nWell this can be\nanything. Just make it up.\nPut a password in and we'll scroll\ndown just a little bit until we see.\nSelect an image. We're\nusing Ubuntu Perfect region.\nSelect somewhere close to\nyou. Leno is a cloud provider.\nSo they have data centers everywhere.\nPick somewhere close to you so it'll\nbe nice and fast. I'm in Dallas.\nAnd finally our LE node plan. From\nhere, let's click on share. At cpu,\nthey're cheaper. And here we have our\nplans or the size of our virtual machine.\nNow normally I would pick this one\nright here. It's five bucks a month,\nsuper cheap. But for waza, you want\nsomething a bit beefier, a bit bigger,\nsomething more like the\nLE node, four gigabyte.\nNow if you don't select the four gigabyte\noption for this WASA installation,\nit just won't work. I tried it.\nSo just make sure you select this.\nNow if you do wanna go for a smaller\noption, like the LE node, two gigabyte,\nI actually got that working with\nDocker and it worked pretty well.\nI'll walk you through that here in a\nsecond. Well, let's go ahead and do this.\nIt's really not much more. It's\nso easy. So select four gigabyte.\nScroll down just a bit, label\nthis sucker, whatever you want.\nEnter a root password.\nAnd finally we'll scroll down and click\non create LE node at the bottom right.\nReady, set, go. Now\nit's gonna do its thing.\nIt's gonna bake you a VM in\nthe cloud. Quick coffee break,\nit'll be a few minutes. And once you\nsee that your LE node is running,\nwe can try and connect to it. Over\nhere we have our SSH access command.\nWe're gonna go ahead and copy this\nright here and then launch your terminal\nWindows, Mac and Linux. It'll all\nwork. And paste that in there. Enter,\naccept all fingerprints. Put\nyour password in and we're in.\nBut it may not be quite ready. Waza is\nstill going through its installation.\nWe can monitor it kind of right\nnow by typing in H top H T O P.\nAnd we'll see right at the top there,\nthe top process. D P K G or D package.\nThat's how apps on Linux are installed\nand that's what's happening right now.\nSo we can kinda sit there and\nwatch that until that stops.\nAnd we can try to connect here\nin a moment and like see here,\nwe have some wza stuff there. The\nWZA index year is being installed.\nThere's a bunch of pieces to\nit. It's amazing. But again,\nquick coffee break and\nwatch the magic happen.\nNow at this point it's been about\nsix minutes. Let's see if it's done.\nAnd we'll start with grabbing\nour password. By the way,\nI hit control C to get out of that,\nif we type in LS dash al\nand our terminal here,\nwe should see a dot deployment\ndash secrets dot txc file.\nThere it has our secrets or our\npasswords. Let's go ahead and cap that.\nCats dot deployment secrets,\nblah blah. Got it. Bam.\nThere's our passwords right there.\nThe first one we want is the\nadmin password at the top.\nGot our admin username and our admin\npassword. Cool, keep that there.\nLet's go back to our\nLE node dashboard here.\nAnd we're gonna grab our LE node reverse\nDNS name or R D N S. So here Leno node.\nClick on the network tab.\nScroll down just a little bit until\nwe see the IP addresses section.\nAnd then we have the reverse DNS right\nhere. There it is. Just go and grab that,\ncopy it.\nOpen a new tab and go to https colon\nwhack whack paste that in  .\nHere we go. It's there. Now let's get\nlogged in. Use your name admin password.\nLet's grab that from the terminal\nthere. It's copy and paste.\nIt's gonna check and make sure things\nare good. Almost there or good. Awesome.\nThis seems pretty cool. Last time\nI'll do that joke. Probably not.\nSeems like a ock. Sorry .\nIt's terrible. Now before we move on,\nI'm gonna show the docker\ninstall. It's super easy.\nIf you don't care about that,\nthat's fine. Just skip ahead.\nI've got timestamps below. Now\nhere's the docker install. Perfect.\nFour on-prem or a smaller machine on LE\nnode, which is what I'll be doing here.\nLeno. I'm gonna click on create le node.\nI'll just deploy a standard\nUbuntu 2204 lts machine,\nshared cpu. I know that the LE\nnode, two gigabyte plan will work.\nI tried it on the one gig, the containers\njust wouldn't run. Don't try it.\nBut the two gig plan, it worked great.\nSo click that, label it something fun,\nput a password in and then click on\ncreate le node. How fast was that?\nNow if you're doing this on-prem,\njust have a server that's running Docker\nand of course if you want to run the\nova, I'll put a link below and wass\ndocumentation. After a moment or two,\nyou should see that your machine is\nrunning. Let's go and connect to it.\nWe'll grab our SSH access command over\nhere. Just copy that. Launch my terminal,\npaste it, head enter, accept all\nfingerprints, password. And we're in.\nCouple things we'll do real quick.\nFirst we'll update our repositories.\nPseudo a P t update. Now many of you're\ngonna go, why is he doing pseudo?\nYou're route. I always do pseudo\ncause I don't know what you're using.\nYou may not be root right now. I just\nwanna make it simple. Anyways, I digress.\nPseudo PT update to update our\nrepositories. Once that finishes up,\nwe'll do a pseudo PT and\ninstall docker.io and docker\ndash compose. We'll do\na dash y at the end.\nThis is going to install docker\nand Docker compose. So let's go.\nShould be fairly quick. More of a coffee\nsip here. Awesome, it is finished.\nThe next step, I've got a link below.\nGo ahead and pull up the Waza\ndocumentation for a docker deployment.\nWell one two punch this real quick.\nFirst we'll clone the get repository\none command. Let's copy that.\nGo back to your terminal, paste that\ncommand assuming you have get installed.\nMost oss do clone. Awesome type in Ls.\nWe'll see a new directory\ncalled waza Docker.\nLet's go ahead and CD into that cd,\nwaza, Docker type in LS once more.\nAnd we have one more\ndirectory we wanna jump into.\nIt's the single node directory because\nwe're deploying one single node or\ncomputer cd single node. Perfect.\nNow the next thing we'll have to do is\ngenerate some self sign certificates.\nThey make that super easy for us.\nThey even have a Docker compose\nfile to run and do that for us.\nAnd all we have to do is\ncopy and paste this command.\nSo copy this command right here,\npaste that in there, hit enter.\nIt's gonna pull those images down.\nRun, compose. And then that was it.\nThat's done. Now for our next step,\nall we have to do is do the\ndocker dash compose command\nwith the up option. And then we'll do a\ndash D to launch it in the background.\nThis will do everything for us. This\nis our last step in deploying this.\nIt's super easy. I love docker. Ready,\nset, go. This will take a moment.\nIt's deploying a multi-tier\napplication, pulling all the images,\na lot of stuff going on. Little coffee\nbreak. We'll give it some time here.\nOkay, deployment is done, done, done.\nLet's confirm real quick\nby typing in docker stats.\nGet a realtime view of those suckers\nrunning. Let's go get logged in.\nLet's check it out. We'll get\nback to our Leno dashboard here.\nGo to the network tab. Scroll\ndown just a little bit,\nfind our reverse DNS name right\nhere in the IP addresses section.\nGo ahead and copy that and we'll\nopen up a new tab. Type in https,\ncolon whack whack, paste that in\nthere. Let's go. Fingers crossed. Okay,\nthis is a self-signed cert. We'll get\nthis little error message. No big deal.\nShould proceed. Was that sorry. Um,\nthis video has so many lame jokes.\nLet's get logged in. Default. Login will\nbe admin password will be according to.\nWas it documentation? What\nwas it? Was it ? Sorry.\nSorry, not sorry. Oh, it's uh, secret\npassword. Capital S. Capital P.\nEasy enough. Just gotta check and make\nsure things are good. Almost. Okay,\nthings are good. Now that\nwe have, was it installed?\nLet's get some agents added.\nComputers that we can monitor.\nSo right here we'll click on add\nagent right here in the dashboard.\nAnd then right here we'll have\nthe option to deploy a new agent.\nGo ahead and click on that. This\nis super straightforward and easy.\nWe'll start with the\nLinux host first. Again,\nI'm gonna do Ubuntu and we'll do\na Windows after this. By the way,\nUbuntu 15 or more architecture is X 86.\nBut notice we have options\nfor everything. It's awesome.\nThen we'll put our was a\nserver address in here.\nThis will simply be your LE node,\nreverse DNS name if you did it with\nme or it could be an IP address.\nJust something that the agent can have\naccess to. So I'll copy that server.\nAddress the F Q D N fully qualified\ndomain name just like this.\nI will name that agent. It's optional\nbut I like to Callie underscore Linux.\nWe'll select a group. I'll\nput it in the default group.\nAnd then on step six they give you one\ncommand to install the agent. Super cool.\nSuper easy. Let's copy that. Copy command.\nAnd then here in Cali I'll launch my\nterminal. Paste that command head,\nenter pseudo password and it's done.\nCool. One more thing we have to do,\ngetting back to the was a dashboard.\nWe need to enable this as a service.\nWe'll just copy this. Command\nall system, CTL commands,\npaste those commands in there,\nhead enter and done. Awesome.\nSo now getting back to the WASA dashboard.\nWe can go to the top left here on\nthis drop down and click on agents.\nThere it is right there. My first little\nguy, Callie Lennox, his IP address os.\nAnd it's gonna show us so much more.\nOh, I can't wait to show you this,\nbut first, before we do that,\nlet's add Windows real quick.\nBut notice how fast and easy this\nis and Windows. It's just as easy.\nLet's go ahead and do\nuh, deploy new agent.\nOnce more this time we'll\nclick on Windows. Goodness,\nthey still have Windows\nXP in here. .\nI guess you need a scene\nfor this man. But anyways,\nI'm on Windows seven or more or\ngreater. No Windows arm support, sad,\nfully qualified domain name would be our\nsame. I uh, domain name or IP address.\nAgain, just something your agent can have\naccess to. I'll name it default group.\nAnd finally at step six, just like Linux,\nwe're gonna have our little\none-liner command using PowerShell.\nKeeping in mind you will need to run\nthis as administrator cause you will need\nadmin privileges. So I'll\njust copy that command,\njump into my Windows computer here.\nSo here in Windows I'll\nlaunch my Windows terminal.\nKeeping in mind I'll have\nto launch it as admin.\nSo right click this and click on run as\nadministrator. Pace my command in there,\nhit enter. Gonna do its thing.\nAnd then one more command.\nWe'll have to start the\nservice here on Windows.\nJust like Linux net start was a SVC\nwas a is starting and we're off to the\nraces. Let's go check Waza, the Waza\ndashboard. We'll go to our agents.\nOh there it is. It's still coming up.\nLet's click on refresh over here on\nthe right. Refresh, refresh, refresh.\nCome on. Connect. I'm impatient.\nAnd after a billion refreshes. No,\nI'm just kidding. It was like\nthree. Um, it's up. Awesome.\nAnd here's our two machines at Lennox\nand Windows. And you know what,\nI wanna add one more\njust for fun. Ready Go.\nIt was seriously actually\nalmost that fast.\nSo here we have our agents and now let's\nclick on one of these and see what's\ngoing on. This is gonna be fun.\nSo I'm gonna click on the new one.\nI just added the Circs network. Chuck,\nthat's from my CIRCS search video.\nIt's a public box and it's\ngonna be kind of fun to look at.\nIt's click on that guy. And here's our\nagent dashboard for this one computer,\nthis one server. There's a lot going on.\nBut just keep in mind\nat the top here in Waza,\nwe kind of have breadcrumbs\nand I love this.\nWe've got agents and we're drilled down\ninto the specific agent we're looking\nat. And then here at the\ndashboard, so much going on.\nNow I'm not gonna show you\neverything. There's way too much,\nway too much fun to be had.\nBut I will point out a few\nthings that are like kind of wow.\nFirst the Mitre framework.\nThe Mitre attack framework.\nWe won't go too deep into this,\nbut just know it's a database of hacking\ntechniques that hackers will use to\nattack machines. This will look at\nthat framework and tell you, Hey,\nyour machine might be vulnerable to this,\nthese tactics or your machine is\nactively being attacked in these ways.\nAnd notice, um, some things\nare happening to mine.\nWe'll take a look at those here in\na bit. And then quick drive by here.\nCompliance. Many companies have to obey\ncertain compliance standards like pci,\ngdpr, nist, hipaa. This will\ncheck all your computers,\nall your servers and tell you what's\ngoing on. That's kind of crazy. Now,\nyou may not care about policies. You\nshould if you wanna get into security,\nbut it may not be important for\nyou right now. Scroll down a bit.\nWhat about configuration? Is your server\nor your computer configured securely?\nDo you know that for a fact?\nWell this will tell you .\nIt has a module called SCA\nor secure configuration.\nI think it's audit or assessment,\nsecure configuration assessment.\nAnd it will pull out a C I S assessment.\nThis is for buntu Linux and\ntell you how good you are. Um,\n39% on my score failed 715 of these.\nNow let me give you like kind of\na baseline for what that means.\nLet's jump into this report.\nNotice here in the breadcrumbs,\nI did jump into the security configuration\nassessment section and it'll tell me\nall the things I failed at. Let me\nactually sort by. Uh, good stuff.\nIt's gonna be a small list. And\nmost of this is like default.\nSo like App Armor is installed cool,\nbut it'll go deeper and tell you things\nlike hey you should disable USB storage.\nIf that drill down to SSH cuz you can\nsearch for specific things like that.\nKeyword . It'll tell me things\nlike, hey don't install Telenet.\nU F W is not enabled.\nDisable ssh sh root login.\nSo not only is it showing\nyou like hey you're insecure,\nbut it's also teaching you. Cause\nif I click on any one of these,\nit'll tell me like, Hey\nhere's the rationale, here's\nwhy we're telling you this.\nHere's how you fix it,\nhere's how you check it.\nAnd then it shows you all the mire\ntechniques that can be used against having\nthat misconfiguration. That's so\nfreaking powerful. Are you kidding me?\nIt's okay, I'm getting a little\nexcited coffee, you'll calm me down.\nThat's just one module speed mode. Let's\nget back to our agent dashboard here.\nHere on the menu we have security events\nshowing you things like authentication\nfailures, which could be brute force\nattacks. It'll show you top five alerts.\nIt'll give you a list of\nsecurity alerts. Super powerful.\nAnd then here's something you're not\ngonna see right away. If I click on more,\nwe have vulnerabilities.\nIt'll check your system for\nvulnerabilities but it's\nnot enabled by default.\nI'll show you how to do\nthis here in a moment.\nBut I have another system I already\nhad up and running and if I look at\nvulnerabilities for that one,\nit's gonna check all my\napplications and tell me like, Hey,\nare there known CBEs out there\nor common vulnerabilities?\nAnd I've got a bunch  like\na lot. But just look at this,\ndeploy this for your house or your\nservers or whatever you have and play\nsecurity admin. Go in here and go,\noh wow, I've got 170 critical CDEs.\nI should go figure out how to fix\nthose. The learning opportunity.\nAre you kidding me? And then here\non my server I already had going.\nI do wanna show you one thing here on one\nof my Windows hosts or Windows agents.\nThis is kind of fun. I have my daughter's\ncomputer here, this is amazing.\nCheck this out. I'll click on Chloe.\nAnd the one thing you're gonna love\nabout Windows Host is the integrity\nmonitoring module. Oh my gosh,\nthing's amazing. Check it out.\nThe sucker's gonna monitor all the\nimportant files and registry keys that are\nnormally modified when\nsomething's being hacked.\nIt's gonna look at things and tell\nyou when things are being adjusted.\nSo like check this out. If I go to events,\nit'll tell me each time a\nregister key is changed.\nLike this one was deleted firewall\npolicy. I don't know why that happened.\nNow some of these are automatic,\nlike the Windows OS is doing it,\nbut others can be bad\n. It's gotta crazy.\nAnd it's not just registry keys.\nIf I go to inventory over here,\nI can see that it has\ninventory of the files,\nit's monitoring and all the registry keys,\nit's monitoring and what they're\ncurrently set to. Is it not insane?\nAnd here in a moment I'll\nshow you how you can s uh,\nmonitor specific keys and get alerts on\nthose keys and files too. It's so fun.\nNow at this point your seam\nseems to be doing great. I lied,\nI was gonna do it one more time.\nIt seems to be doing pretty good.\nPretty much all you\nhave to do is set it up,\nconnect an agent to it and it collects\ninformation and you can go crazy and\nlearn cybersecurity and\nstart to protect your stuff.\nBut you can also tinker with this quite\na bit. You can enable more modules,\nset up more alerts, monitor more\nthings. So if you're interested in that,\nwe're gonna walk through\na few more options here.\nNow the first thing we'll do is look\nat file monitoring through Windows.\nIt's so powerful and so cool. So\nback here at the WASA incense,\nI deployed with you\nright now in this video.\nCouple things real quick just\nbefore we jump into that.\nIf I click on the home icon,\nit's gonna take me to the WASA dashboard\nand it's gonna show me like all the\nmodules I could jump into. So for example,\nif I wanna jump into security events,\nit's gonna show me security events.\nBut right now it's being\nfiltered to look at one agent.\nI can unpin that to where it's showing\nme everything from every agent.\nThat's pretty cool. And you can do that\nwith most modules. Let's go back home.\nNow let's click on Waza once\nmore. Will Waza drop down here?\nLet's click on agents. Now again,\nI'm not going over everything.\nEvery little thing you can do and you\ndon't have to know all these things,\nbut you can play around\nwith it. You can go crazy.\nI'm just giving you enough to get\nstarted and have a little bit of fun and\nthings I got really excited about.\nSo let's click on agents here.\nWe'll click on my Windows machine.\nA couple things I'm gonna\nshow you real quick.\nIf I click on Integrity Monitoring,\nthis is the module that\nwe'll use to monitor files.\nNotice I don't have any events right now.\nI've got it filtered right now by the\nlast 24 hours and I've just connected this\nthing, nothing's happened.\nBut if I go to the inventory,\nI can see that it already has scanned\nand inventoried all the default files.\nIt'll look for in the\ndirectories. And my registry keys.\nI believe it's set to scan\neverything every 12 hours.\nAnd if it notices a change, it'll let\nyou know. It'll alert you. Pretty cool.\nBut with files we can also do real\ntime notification and rule set.\nCheck this out.\nI'm gonna jump into my Windows host and\nchange some configuration for the agent\nfile. Now you can find that here.\nI'm gonna go to my Windows Explorer,\ngo to my C Drive, go\nto program files X 86.\nNow if this is all like weird for\nyou, like oh man Windows file system,\nI don't know what's going on.\nI do detail a lot of what this means\nand how it's organized in my Windows\nFundamentals course on my academy.\nCheck it out, link below. Anyways,\nlet's continue. It's an X 86 and\nin a folder called OS sec Agent,\njump in there. Continue.\nYou gotta have admin access.\nIf I scroll down just a bit,\nI'll see a file named os sec.com.\nThat's your configuration\nfile for your agent.\nLet's go to open that with notepad.\nOpen with notepad. Oh, by the way,\nyou can do the same thing on Linux.\nI'll put documentation below.\nIt's pretty much the same process, just\nediting the same type of agent file.\nBut let's walk through this\nreal quick here in this file,\nI'm just gonna search for sis check\nto get to the SIS check section.\nThat's hard to say.\n. And here right uh,\nyou can see that I have the file\nintegrity monitoring section.\nAnd you can see right here all the\ndirectories that is by default set to\nmonitor.\nSo what we'll do here is we'll just\nchoose a place amongst all these directory\noptions and we'll add a\nlittle configuration here.\nWe'll type in directories and we'll\nadd an option that'll give us real time\nalerts. It's really simple what's\ncalled real time, just like that.\nHave it equal yes in quotes.\nWe'll add one more option\nreport underscore changes.\nHave that equal yes in quotes and\nwe'll add one more check underscore\nall and have that equal yes as well.\nSo just to make sure we're\nall on the same page here,\nwe're specifying a directory and we're\ngiving it these options real time. Yes,\nreport changes, yes. And check\nall. Yes, we'll close that out.\nAnd then add the directory. We're\ngonna monitor with all these options.\nLet's see to our desktop.\nSo we'll do CE colon slash\nusers slash your username.\nMine is network check slash desktop.\nAnd then we'll close that out with a\nleft arrow forward slash directories just\nlike this. So now we'll\nsave this file, file save.\nAnd then we'll restart the service by\nlaunching our terminal as administrator.\nRight click run as administrator\nand we'll say restart service.\nDash name waza. Cool.\nSo that should be good.\nSo I'm gonna open up my\nWaza dashboard real quick.\nMake sure I'm on the events tab.\nNotice and look at the last 24 hours,\nnothing's happened. Let's\nchange something on our desktop.\nThis is so cool and powerful. I hope\nthis illustrates how cool this is.\nShe's gonna go to my desktop and I'm\ngonna add a new file, new text document.\nCan you see this? Just take\nabout five seconds. One, two,\nlet's take a look. Let's\nrefresh this. .\nThere it is. No, it's weird.\nI said added, deleted, added.\nOh I think because they changed\nthe name in real time. But look,\nit monitored that I add a new, uh, a\nnew file. Um, check this out. So that's,\nthat's one alert. If I change anything\nabout it, let's open it up. Say, Hey,\nI'm changing stuff. We'll save it,\nwe'll see if the new alert comes in.\nI'll refresh my options\nhere or refresh my page.\nThere it is sis check event\nmodified. And it's like, Hey,\nthe check sum changed on this.\nIt'll even tell me down here\nwhat I changed the text I\nadded. How crazy is that?\nNow we can do the same kind of\nthing with the Windows registry.\nNow it won't be real time,\nthey don't have that option,\nbut it will scan every 12 hours.\nYou can change that interval.\nLet me share real quick. We can specify.\nSo right now Pilic was an inventory,\nright? We can see that it does have\nan inventory. Look at our new file.\nIt does have an inventory of registered\nkeys that automatically monitors,\nbut we can add specific ones\nthat we want to have seen.\nSo let's add a custom one real quick.\nI'll open up a red edit here\nin Windows to edit my registry.\nLet's add one inside. Uh, I don't know,\nhq, local machine. We'll go to software,\nmaybe classes. And let's add one\nright here, right click say New key,\nwe'll say Bernard Hack. Well bam,\nwe'll change the value to something fun.\nSo what I'll do here is I'll right click\nthis key and say copy key name and then\nwe'll go back to our\nagent configuration file.\nAnd you'll notice just under that same\nkind of section where we're adding\ndirectories, we also have\nregistry keys we can add.\nSo I'll go kind of\ntowards the bottom here,\njust underneath the last registry entry\nand right before the entry to ignore,\nI'll line myself up with everything\nelse, type in Windows registry,\npaste my key name,\nand then close it out with a left arrow\nforward slash Windows registry and a\nright arrow. Cool, that\nshould be all we need.\nAnd it'll change the\nfrequency cuz like I said,\nit's gonna take 12 hours to find\nthis. We don't want it to do that.\nSo up here we have frequency that CIS\ncheck is executed by default every 12\nhours. 43, 200.\nLet's change that from that\nto 60. So every, every minute.\nActually let's do 30 seconds. Let's\nbe quick. So I'll save this file.\nI'll restart my service. My was a\nservice to once some more restart.\nService name was a Got it go. Cool.\nSo getting back to our WASA dashboard\nhere in our integrity monitoring section\nfor our Windows machine.\nI'm gonna go over here to inventory and\njust see if it finds that new registry\nkey. I'll go to registry, I'll search\nfor, what do we name it Bernard?\nNothing yet. Way for it to find\nit. There it is right there.\nSo it found the key. It's looking\nat it, it's monitoring it. Cool.\nNow let's go to events. Now you see\nthat we've got some registry changes,\nmainly time and we're getting that\nbecause we were setting it to every 30\nseconds. Notice nothing about a\nregistry key here. Let's go change it.\nLet's go modify it. Hammer Bernard, hack.\nWell I'll change the value\nto something else. Fun\nor you got hacked. Cool, let's change\nit there. It'll take about 30 seconds.\nTake a little coffee break and\nlet's monitor our was the dashboard.\nI'll refresh it a few times. And oh\nthere it is. Register key modified.\nHow killer is that? Now you may be\nwondering, okay, big deal Chuck,\nI'll barely even know there.\nBut when does registry is,\nwhy do I care if it's\nchanged? And first of all,\nthe registry like has these settings\nfor the configuration of your operating\nsystem. So if things are changed\nhere, it's changing everywhere else.\nSome common things you might see\nchanged, especially with malware.\nIs this key here? Does it seem Microsoft\nWindows? Where's it at? Where's it at?\nWindows Current version. There's\na lot of keys in here man.\nAnd we have run and run\nonce these keys are changed,\nwhen you add like a new startup\napplication for your system.\nSo what malware will do is I'll go in\nhere and add a new key new string value.\nCall this, I'll call this bad stuff and\nI'll just say internet explorer .\nLet's, let's copy that location.\nOkay? And looking back at Waza,\nit does monitor that by default. And\nhere in the events, if I refresh it,\nthere it is. Register\nkey added and modified.\nThere's the name of it right there. Bad\nstuff. That's pretty powerful, right?\nThe next thing I wanna show you actions.\nThey're so powerful. Check this out.\nLet's go to our agents here and I'll\njump into my Linux machine here.\nCircs Network, Chuck. Now let's go to\nsecurity events and I'll jump to events.\nNow there'll be a lot of events\nhere because this machine's public.\nNow I'm getting things like attempt\nto log in using a non-existent user.\nGetting Bruteforce from Russia using\nthe user name Pie . That's funny.\nAnyways, we can do something with that.\nAnd actually I wanna try it myself.\nI'm gonna try in brute force,\nI'm gonna launch my Callie Linux machine\nhere and I'll use hydro to brute force\nthe login and I'll use the\nusername, uh, Bernard Hack.\nWell and we'll see if\nit sees us. Ready, set,\ngo after a pseudo password. Here\nwe go. Okay, it's attacking.\nWe should see a log. Let's go look at\nthe logs here. Security events. Events.\nThis happened just now. Let's\nsee if it was us. Use your name.\nBernard Hack Wall. So there,\nthere we are. How cool was that?\nLet's stop that nonsense. Let's real\nquick. See if I try to log into it. Okay,\nso I, I'm getting a password\nprompt so I'm not being blocked.\nSo clearly I can sit here and just try\nand try and try again to my heart's\ncontent.\nBut what if I had our seam actively\nrespond to that and add it to the block\nlist, drop it, add it to the firewall.\nWe can do that. Check it out.\nIt's called active response, which\ncan be used for so many things.\nBut I wanna demo this real\nquick. Now, to change this,\nwe're gonna go to the\nconfiguration of our was a server.\nSo we're gonna go here to the was a menu,\ngo to management and then\nclick on configuration.\nFrom here we're gonna go to the top\nright and click on edit configuration.\nAnd we're gonna scroll down a bit until\nwe see a section called active response.\nActually, you know, why am I tripping?\nI'm just gonna search for it.\nActive response. Cool, there\nit is. Active response.\nSo scroll down a bit until\nI see this right here.\nIt's kinda giving you a format\nfor what it should look like.\nAnd I'm gonna copy this config from\nthe documentation. Thank you Waza.\nCheck it out here. Command is firewall,\ndrop location, the server. It's uh,\nthe rule is executing on and then it's\ngonna look at a rule or it's looking for\na rule. This rule is what\ntriggers this firewall drop.\nNow when we tried to brute force what\nrule was triggered? Let's go find out.\nI'm gonna jump to uh, our\nagents. Go back to my circ Circs,\ngo to security Events. Events and\nlet's see, it was just earlier, right?\nLike at 33. Yeah. So here's the alert.\nYou can see yes, it was Bernard Hack.\nWell and there's the alert ID\nright there. The rule ID 57 10.\nThat's what we want it to alert off of.\nSo let's go back to our configuration\nthing here and we'll change that rule from\n57 63 to 57 10 and this will\ntime it out or add the firewall\nrule. And the time out\nhere is 180 seconds.\nIt'll block the attacker for 180\nseconds. Pretty cool. So let's save that.\nClick on save, restart our manager. Just\ngive that a little, little bit of time.\nHere're starting, please wait,\ncoffee break. Okay, it's restarted.\nNow what we wanna do now\nis go back to our agent,\ngo back to Search network Chuck and\nwe'll go to security events and go to\nevents. So last thing we saw agent\nstarted and stopped. Refresh that. Okay,\nwe're here now let's go and try\nto brute force it one more time.\nActually real quickly, see if we can\nlog in. So this time I'm gonna use Root.\nI know a real user on that system.\nLet's see if it lets me. Okay, so we're,\nit's allowing us right now. Now\nwe don't have to brute force.\nWe can just try to log\nin with Bernard Hack.\nWell what that should do is trigger.\nNow it's right now it's 1203.\nIt should trigger that new active\nrule. Let's go see. Bam. There it is.\nSo 1203 attempt. Attempt to log in\nwith non-existent user. Bernard Hack.\nWell immediately the firewall at drop\nactive response blocks me. So now,\nright now for 180 seconds\nanyway, if I even try to log in,\neven with a real user, I\nget nothing. I'm blocked.\nI can't even ping it.\n, it's kinda crazy.\nLet's do a continuous ping and see when\nit lets me out outta jail here. Oh,\nwe're back. We're back. Okay, so how\ncool is that? And just so you know,\nyou can do those active responses based\non a variety of rules. It's so custom.\nThat's why this is so powerful.\nYou can even do it off of like a certain\ncommand was run or a certain log came\nabout in, in the system you can run a\na, an active response. It's so crazy.\nNow two more things I wanna show you\nreal quick. First is vulnerabilities. Um,\nright now if I go to my search network,\nChuck and I go to Vulnerabilities.\nNothing there. Why? Because\nit's not enabled by default.\nThe system does not search for that. So\nit's really, really easy to set this up.\nWe'll go to waza management configuration.\nJust like before we'll\ngo to edit configuration.\nAnd here we're gonna search for\nvulnerability detector. Right there.\nIt tells us enabled. No,\nlet's change that to yes,\nwe definitely want that. Then we click\non save and restart Manager, confirm now.\nSo once this restarts, notice\nthe options it has here.\nIt'll run a full scan every six hours.\nIt'll also run on Start when the service\nstarts up. So once this finishes,\nwe'll restart our service and Windows\nand Linux and see what happens. Okay,\ncool. It's done there.\nI'm gonna go to Windows,\nrestart my service here and\nwe're restart my service here.\nI restarting was at Agents.\nCool. So now at this point,\nand if we check our agents, I'll\njust go to my Windows machine here,\ngo to vulnerabilities. Cool. So\nscan's complete, didn't find anything.\nNow the reason for that is that my Windows\nmachine has like no apps installed on\nit,\nbut just know to enable the vulnerability\nscanning you have to enable it on the\nsystem, on the Waza server. But the\nagents have that configured by default.\nNow if I go back to my other server that\nhas all kinds of fun stuff configured,\nI gotta get logged back in here.\nChloe, she has a bad version of vlc,\nmedia player, high severity cde.\nWow, look at that, dude, this is fun.\nGives you all the details of\nit. Oh my gosh, it's so cool.\nBut I wouldn't have known that if I\ndidn't have this on her system and it just\ntells me automatically.\nNow speaking of telling you automatically\nyou'll need some sort of alert, right?\nWaza has that. They've got\nemail alerts and Slack alerts.\nI'm gonna show you Slack real\nquick. How to set that up.\nThe first one I'll do is open on Slack\nand create a new channel just for waza\nWaza alerts.\nNow I'll go out to Slack\nand create a new app.\nNow this will not be a tutorial\non how Slack apps work.\nI'll just walk you through the basics\nyou need to know about right now.\nAnd this goes without saying\nyou do need a Slack account.\nSo I'll click on create new app\nfrom name it was uh, alerts,\nselect my workspace, create the app.\nAnd then all I wanna add really is\nan incoming webhook. Activate it.\nAnd then at the bottom I'll click\non add new webhook to workspace.\nI'll click on new channel Waza\nAlerts Allow. And that's it.\nAnd all I need from this is this\nwebhook url. I'll copy that,\nget back to my Wza dashboard.\nAnd I'm gonna go back to\nthat configuration page\nwhere we were at before where\nwe spent a lot of time. Click\non Wza, go to management,\nand then go to configuration. Same thing\nas before. Click on edit configuration.\nAnd here I'm gonna search for\nintegrations or just integration.\nAnd it looks like I don't have a\nsection for that. I'll just add it here.\nSo I'll just go to the top and just under\nglobal and I'll paste this config from\nthe documentation.\nThe only thing I'll change here\nis pasting my webhook right there,\nwhich I need to copy\nagain, paste it there.\nAnd actually there is one more thing I\nwanna change just in case you don't wanna\nbe killed with alerts because this default\n setting will have a bunch of\nalerts sent to me based\non like all the events.\nAnd of course you can change the severity\nlevel of events that are sent to you\nor even just specify a specific rule\nID you're looking for. So for example,\nright underneath here I can add\nrule id. And what do you say we do?\n57 10. That same rule as earlier that we\nare doing the action roll off of. Cool.\nSo we have our web hook in place,\nthe url we have our rule to alert off\nof Save it, save and restart manager.\nOnce that is restarted, we'll do\nour little test here in a moment.\nAnd real quick, look, there's\nnothing in the uh, waza alerts yet.\nIt's kind of quiet here.\nCool, it's restarted.\nNow let's try and log in with\nBernard Hack. Well again,\nthat should block us. And\nthen over here, BAM was alert.\nActually hit my watch too. Was I alert?\nLook at that invalid user. Bernard Hack.\nWell, from this IP address, which I'm\ngonna have Nick or Austin block right now,\nthat's awesome, right? So, okay, this is\nprobably a long video, I realize that.\nBut waza is a powerful tool that will\nnot only help you protect your family,\nyour own lab, your business, but\nit'll teach you a ton about security,\nabout hacking about Blue team and the\nfact that it's free and open source that I\njust did all of this, it costs me\nnothing except for the hosting,\nwhich you could do it on-prem,\nit's gonna be free for you.\nIt's just kind of crazy.\nSo I hope you have as much fun with this\ntool as I have and we'll continue to\nhave fun with. Let me know your\nthoughts below. What do you think?\nLet me know how your was a\ninstallation, implementation went.\nI wanna know all about it.\nAnyways, that's all I have.\nThank you for joining me in this video.\nThank you for having a\nlittle bit of coffee with me.\nI'll see you in the next video.\n",
