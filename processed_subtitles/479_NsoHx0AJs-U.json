  "text": "[Music]\nraise lots of pearls around\nmachine-learning why for the most\nimportant reason because everyone likes\nto know the future even before that\nevent happens for example can I know\nmore about my customers and what are\nthey going to buy from me today can I\nrecommend products based on their search\npatterns and find customers who are\ndissatisfied from my service and based\non that who are likely to churn or\nprobably identified customers who are\nlikely to default on their payment\npatterns now the question is why I would\nlike to make all these predictions\nsimply to ensure that I can take\nnecessary corrective action or necessary\ncorrective measure to ensure the future\nbehavior of customers is in line with my\nexpectation so business owners and\nmarketers would like to predict more\nabout their customers would like to know\nmore about their customers what they\nneed why they need when they need those\nproducts all these information will help\nthem generate more profits secondly why\nmachine learning is important all these\nthings that we discussed machine\nlearning helps us to find and know the\nfuture of our customers predict the\nfuture\nbesides that machine learning also helps\nyou adapt and learn with changing\nscenario these machine learning\ntechniques have a capability by which\nthey can Auto refresh they can\nautomatically refresh within with a new\nstream of data that comes into the\nsystem so with the new stream of data I\ncan refresh my model and\nclick the future and thirdly they also\nhelps you automate things such that you\ncan act and react fast with a changing\nscenario these are some of the reasons\nwhy machine learning of late is gaining\nmore and more prominence machine\nlearning and automation is the way going\nforward if that is what is the way going\nforward and businesses are going to\noperate then let's understand what is\nmachine learning\nsimply put machine learning is algorithm\nthat learns from data identifies\npatterns in data and store that learning\nin form of a model and that model can be\napplied on new set of data to predict\nhow it is going to behave how the\ncustomers are going to behave in future\nso that is what machine learning all\nabout by the way machine learning need\nnot just be applied to customers machine\nlearning techniques can be extended to\nmanufacturing industries machines and\nlines and more for example I can apply\nmachine learning techniques on some\nmanufacturing machine to understand\nwhether any component of that machine is\nlikely to fail in near future if I can\nflick whether a component is going to\nfail in near future I can do a\npreventive breakdown repair and\nmaintenance work in advance even before\nthe machine fails so that helps me\nensure my production and manufacturing\nline continues to work smoothly so these\nare some of the reasons why machine\nlearning is in demand\n[Music]\n",
