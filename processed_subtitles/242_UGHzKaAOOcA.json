  "text": "Let me tell you a story\nabout artificial intelligence.\nThere's a building in Sydney\nat 1 Bligh Street.\nIt houses lots of government apartments\nand busy people.\nFrom the outside, it looks like something\nout of American science fiction:\nall gleaming glass and curved lines,\nand a piece of orange sculpture.\nOn the inside, it has excellent coffee\non the ground floor\nand my favorite lifts in Sydney.\nThey're beautiful;\nthey look almost alive.\nAnd it turns out\nI'm fascinated with lifts.\nFor lots of reasons.\nBut because lifts are one of the places\nyou can see the future.\nIn the 21st century, lifts are interesting\nbecause they're one of the first places\nthat AI will touch you\nwithout you even knowing it happened.\nIn many buildings all around the world,\nthe lifts are running a set of algorithms.\nA form of protoartificial intelligence.\nThat means before you even\nwalk up to the lift to press the button,\nit's anticipated you being there.\nIt's already rearranging\nall the carriages.\nAlways going down, to save energy,\nand to know where\nthe traffic is going to be.\nBy the time you've actually\npressed the button,\nyou're already part of an entire system\nthat's making sense of people\nand the environment\nand the building and the built world.\nI know when we talk about AI,\nwe often talk about a world of robots.\nIt's easy for our imaginations\nto be occupied with science fiction,\nwell, over the last 100 years.\nI say AI and you think \"The Terminator.\"\nSomewhere, for us, making the connection\nbetween AI and the built world,\nthat's a harder story to tell.\nBut the reality is AI is already\neverywhere around us.\nAnd in many places.\nIt's in buildings and in systems.\nMore than 200 years of industrialization\nsuggest that AI will find its way\nto systems-level scale relatively easily.\nAfter all, one telling of that history\nsuggests that all you have to do\nis find a technology,\nachieve scale and revolution will follow.\nThe story of mechanization,\nautomation and digitization\nall point to the role of technology\nand its importance.\nThose stories of technological\ntransformation\nmake scale seem, well, normal.\nOr expected.\nAnd stable.\nAnd sometimes even predictable.\nBut it also puts the focus squarely\non technology and technology change.\nBut I believe that scaling a technology\nand building a system\nrequires something more.\nWe founded the 3Ai Institute\nat the Australian National University\nin September 2017.\nIt has one deceptively simple mission:\nto establish a new branch of engineering\nto take AI safely, sustainably\nand responsibly to scale.\nBut how do you build a new branch\nof engineering in the 21st century?\nWell, we're teaching it into existence\nthrough an experimental education program.\nWe're researching it into existence\nwith locations as diverse\nas Shakespeare's birthplace,\nthe Great Barrier Reef,\nnot to mention one of Australia's\nlargest autonomous mines.\nAnd we're theorizing it into existence,\npaying attention to the complexities\nof cybernetic systems.\nWe're working to build something new\nand something useful.\nSomething to create the next generation\nof critical thinkers and critical doers.\nAnd we're doing all of that\nthrough a richer understanding\nof AI's many pasts and many stories.\nAnd by working collaboratively\nand collectively\nthrough teaching and research\nand engagement,\nand by focusing as much\non the framing of the questions\nas the solving of the problems.\nWe're not making a single AI,\nwe're making the possibilities for many.\nAnd we're actively working\nto decolonize our imaginations\nand to build a curriculum and a pedagogy\nthat leaves room for a range of different\nconversations and possibilities.\nWe are making and remaking.\nAnd I know we're always\na work in progress.\nBut here's a little glimpse\ninto how we're approaching\nthat problem of scaling a future.\nWe start by making sure\nwe're grounded in our own history.\nIn December of 2018,\nI took myself up to the town of Brewarrina\non the New South Wales-Queensland border.\nThis place was a meeting place\nfor Aboriginal people,\nfor different groups,\nto gather, have ceremonies,\nmeet, to be together.\nThere, on the Barwon River,\nthere's a set of fish weirs\nthat are one of the oldest\nand largest systems\nof Aboriginal fish traps in Australia.\nThis system is comprised\nof 1.8 kilometers of stone walls\nshaped like a series of fishnets\nwith the \"Us\" pointing down the river,\nallowing fish to be trapped\nat different heights of the water.\nThey're also fish holding pens\nwith different-height walls for storage,\ndesigned to change the way the water moves\nand to be able to store\nbig fish and little fish\nand to keep those fish\nin cool, clear running water.\nThis fish-trap system was a way to ensure\nthat you could feed people\nas they gathered there in a place\nthat was both a meeting of rivers\nand a meeting of cultures.\nIt isn't about the rocks\nor even the traps per se.\nIt is about the system\nthat those traps created.\nOne that involves technical knowledge,\ncultural knowledge\nand ecological knowledge.\nThis system is old.\nSome archaeologists\nthink it's as old as 40,000 years.\nThe last time we have its recorded uses\nis in the nineteen teens.\nIt's had remarkable longevity\nand incredible scale.\nAnd it's an inspiration to me.\nAnd a photo of the weir\nis on our walls here at the Institute,\nto remind us of the promise\nand the challenge\nof building something meaningful.\nAnd to remind us\nthat we're building systems\nin a place where people have built systems\nand sustained those same systems\nfor generations.\nIt isn't just our history,\nit's our legacy as we seek to establish\na new branch of engineering.\nTo build on that legacy\nand our sense of purpose,\nI think we need a clear framework\nfor asking questions about the future.\nQuestions for which there aren't\nready or easy answers.\nHere, the point is the asking\nof the questions.\nWe believe you need to go\nbeyond the traditional approach\nof problem-solving,\nto the more complicated one\nof question asking\nand question framing.\nBecause in so doing, you open up\nall kinds of new possibilities\nand new challenges.\nFor me, right now,\nthere are six big questions\nthat frame our approach\nfor taking AI safely, sustainably\nand responsibly to scale.\nQuestions about autonomy,\nagency, assurance,\nindicators, interfaces and intentionality.\nThe first question we ask is a simple one.\nIs the system autonomous?\nThink back to that lift on Bligh Street.\nThe reality is, one day,\nthat lift may be autonomous.\nWhich is to say it will be able\nto act without being told to act.\nBut it isn't fully autonomous, right?\nIt can't leave that Bligh Street building\nand wonder down\nto Circular Quay for a beer.\nIt goes up and down, that's all.\nBut it does it by itself.\nIt's autonomous in that sense.\nThe second question we ask:\ndoes this system have agency?\nDoes this system have controls\nand limits that live somewhere\nthat prevent it from doing certain\nkinds of things under certain conditions.\nThe reality with lifts,\nthat's absolutely the case.\nThink of any lift you've been in.\nThere's a red keyslot\nin the elevator carriage\nthat an emergency services person\ncan stick a key into\nand override the whole system.\nBut what happens\nwhen that system is AI-driven?\nWhere does the key live?\nIs it a physical key, is it a digital key?\nWho gets to use it?\nIs that the emergency services people?\nAnd how would you know\nif that was happening?\nHow would all of that be manifested\nto you in the lift?\nThe third question we ask\nis how do we think about assurance.\nHow do we think about all of its pieces:\nsafety, security, trust, risk,\nliability, manageability,\nexplicability, ethics,\npublic policy, law, regulation?\nAnd how would we tell you\nthat the system was safe and functioning?\nThe fourth question we ask\nis what would be our interfaces\nwith these AI-driven systems.\nWill we talk to them?\nWill they talk to us,\nwill they talk to each other?\nAnd what will it mean to have\na series of technologies we've known,\nfor some of us, all our lives,\nnow suddenly behave\nin entirely different ways?\nLifts, cars, the electrical grid,\ntraffic lights, things in your home.\nThe fifth question\nfor these AI-driven systems:\nWhat will the indicators be\nto show that they're working well?\nTwo hundred years\nof the industrial revolution\ntells us that the two most important ways\nto think about a good system\nare productivity and efficiency.\nIn the 21st century,\nyou might want to expand\nthat just a little bit.\nIs the system sustainable,\nis it safe, is it responsible?\nWho gets to judge those things for us?\nUsers of the systems\nwould want to understand\nhow these things are regulated,\nmanaged and built.\nAnd then there's the final,\nperhaps most critical question\nthat you need to ask\nof these new AI systems.\nWhat's its intent?\nWhat's the system designed to do\nand who said that was a good idea?\nOr put another way,\nwhat is the world\nthat this system is building,\nhow is that world imagined,\nand what is its relationship\nto the world we live in today?\nWho gets to be part of that conversation?\nWho gets to articulate it?\nHow does it get framed and imagined?\nThere are no simple answers\nto these questions.\nInstead, they frame what's possible\nand what we need to imagine,\ndesign, build, regulate\nand even decommission.\nThey point us in the right directions\nand help us on a path to establish\na new branch of engineering.\nBut critical questions aren't enough.\nYou also need a way of holding\nall those questions together.\nFor us at the Institute,\nwe're also really interested\nin how to think about AI as a system,\nand where and how to draw\nthe boundaries of that system.\nAnd those feel like especially\nimportant things right now.\nHere, we're influenced by the work\nthat was started way back in the 1940s.\nIn 1944, along with anthropologists\nGregory Bateson and Margaret Mead,\nmathematician Norbert Wiener\nconvened a series of conversations\nthat would become known\nas the Macy Conferences on Cybernetics.\nUltimately, between 1946 and 1953,\nten conferences were held\nunder the banner of cybernetics.\nAs defined by Norbert Wiener,\ncybernetics sought\nto \"develop a language and techniques\nthat will enable us to indeed attack\nthe problem of control and communication\nin advanced computing technologies.\"\nCybernetics argued persuasively\nthat one had to think\nabout the relationship\nbetween humans, computers\nand the broader ecological world.\nYou had to think about them\nas a holistic system.\nParticipants in the Macy Conferences\nwere concerned with how the mind worked,\nwith ideas about\nintelligence and learning,\nand about the role\nof technology in our future.\nSadly, the conversations that started\nwith the Macy Conference\nare often forgotten\nwhen the talk is about AI.\nBut for me, there's something\nreally important to reclaim here\nabout the idea of a system\nthat has to accommodate culture,\ntechnology and the environment.\nAt the Institute, that sort\nof systems thinking is core to our work.\nOver the last three years,\na whole collection of amazing people\nhave joined me here\non this crazy journey to do this work.\nOur staff includes anthropologists,\nsystems and environmental engineers,\nand computer scientists\nas well as a nuclear physicist,\nan award-winning photo journalist,\nand at least one policy\nand standards expert.\nIt's a heady mix.\nAnd the range of experience\nand expertise is powerful,\nas are the conflicts and the challenges.\nBeing diverse requires\na constant willingness\nto find ways to hold people\nin conversation.\nAnd to dwell just a little bit\nwith the conflict.\nWe also worked out early\nthat the way to build\na new way of doing things\nwould require a commitment to bringing\nothers along on that same journey with us.\nSo we opened our doors\nto an education program very quickly,\nand we launched our first\nmaster's program in 2018.\nSince then, we've had two cohorts\nof master's students\nand one cohort of PhD students.\nOur students come from all over the world\nand all over life.\nAustralia, New Zealand, Nigeria, Nepal,\nMexico, India, the United States.\nAnd they range in age from 23 to 60.\nThey variously had backgrounds\nin maths and music,\npolicy and performance,\nsystems and standards,\narchitecture and arts.\nBefore they joined us at the Institute,\nthey ran companies,\nthey worked for government,\nserved in the army, taught high school,\nand managed arts organizations.\nThey were adventurers\nand committed to each other,\nand to building something new.\nAnd really, what more could you ask for?\nBecause although I've spent\n20 years in Silicon Valley\nand I know the stories\nabout the lone inventor\nand the hero's journey,\nI also know the reality.\nThat it's never just a hero's journey.\nIt's always a collection of people\nwho have a shared sense of purpose\nwho can change the world.\nSo where do you start?\nWell, I think you start where you stand.\nAnd for me, that means\nI want to acknowledge\nthe traditional owners of the land\nupon which I'm standing.\nThe Ngunnawal and Ngambri people,\nthis is their land,\nnever ceded, always sacred.\nAnd I pay my respects to the elders,\npast and present, of this place.\nI also acknowledge\nthat we're gathering today\nin many other places,\nand I pay my respects\nto the traditional owners and elders\nof all those places too.\nIt means a lot to me\nto get to say those words\nand to dwell on what they mean and signal.\nAnd to remember that we live in a country\nthat has been continuously occupied\nfor at least 60,000 years.\nAboriginal people built worlds here,\nthey built social systems,\nthey built technologies.\nThey built ways to manage this place\nand to manage it remarkably\nover a protracted period of time.\nAnd every moment any one of us\nstands on a stage as Australians,\nhere or abroad,\nwe carry with us a privilege\nand a responsibility\nbecause of that history.\nAnd it's not just a history.\nIt's also an incredibly rich\nset of resources,\nworldviews and knowledge.\nAnd it should run through all of our bones\nand it should be the story we always tell.\nUltimately, it's about\nthinking differently,\nasking different kinds of questions,\nlooking holistically\nat the world and the systems,\nand finding other people who want\nto be on that journey with you.\nBecause for me,\nthe only way to actually think\nabout the future and scale\nis to always be doing it collectively.\nAnd because for me,\nthe notion of humans in it together\nis one of the ways\nwe get to think about things\nthat are responsible, safe\nand ultimately, sustainable.\nThank you.\n",
