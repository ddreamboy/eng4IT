  "text": "last year on this channel i covered this\nbook and i said i thought it was the\nbest\nintroduction the best practical\nintroduction to machine learning\nthat i'd ever seen and i really do i\nthink it's an excellent book\nand a lot of people agreed with me well\nat the end of last year the second\nedition of this book came out and here\nit is\nand the question is is this book as good\nas the first edition\nlet's take a look i think this book is\neven\nbetter than the previous book it has 250\nextra pages\nlet's take a look at the index so you\nget an\noverall description of machine learning\nyou then get an\nend to em machine learning project so\nwhat i like about this book\nis that it starts at sort of a high\nlevel and then you go into\nmore details differences from the other\nbook where we have this section on\nuh unsupervised learning techniques\nspecifically k-means\nand uh gaussian mixtures they weren't in\nthe previous one\nand then the section on neural networks\nhas been expanded\nand there's a nice section on deep\ncomputer vision using convolutional\nneural networks the book has also been\nupdated to cover tensorflow 2 and\ncarers i think this is even better than\nthe\nfirst edition it has it's an expanded\nversion of the first edition and it has\nall the strengths of the first edition\nplus it covers extra topics\nwhy do i like it i like the way it\nstarts with a high level\nyou know explanation of the field and\nthen you get in chapter two an\nend to end machine learning project to\nfollow through this gives the rest of\nthe book context\nthe topics are very well explained\nthere's a lot of code\nuh and you know code examples and it's\nvery well presented by the time you've\ngone through this\nyou will understand the topic very well\nand in practical terms you'll understand\nhow to\nimplement and build your own projects\nsome criticisms of the book are that\nit's not for beginners you know it's a\nlittle bit too advanced for beginners\nand whilst you could argue that that is\ntrue if you've never done any python\nbefore\nor you don't know linear algebra or a\nlittle bit of calculus\nyou might get a bit lost but i think for\nthe\nreally motivated beginner it would be\nvery good so even if that is you even if\nyou don't know any python\nyou know you'll go away and learn enough\npython to be able to do the book and and\nif you don't know enough math you'll be\nable to go away and learn enough math\nit's the bar is set low enough for you\nto be able to\nteach yourself those things and then\npursue the book\nbut it is true that it's not for\nabsolute beginners\nso if you feel that you're an absolute\nbeginner perhaps\njust read up learn a little bit of\npython and in just enough maths to be\nable then to start using this book\nthe other thing about this book is that\nit's for determined readers only if\nyou're just\na little bit interested in machine\nlearning and wondering here how it might\nbe implemented using python\nthis book won't be for you because you\nknow to be able to learn from this book\nyou've got to\nbe very motivated to want to get all the\nway through it\nthe things in this book the topics that\nare covered are you know they're\nthey're complex they're challenging and\nthey will require\nthought this isn't bedtime reading it's\ngoing to take you if you're a beginner\na good few months to get through it but\nthat's no bad thing because it's so\ncomprehensive\nyou'll know the subject very well and\nyou know in the uk it's 35\npounds which for such a comprehensive\nbook on the subject\ni think is extremely good value and if\nyou look at the cost of\nmachine learning courses out there it\ncompares very\nfavorably to that so if you are a deter\nyou know if you're determined to learn\nmachine learning if you're very\nmotivated to learn machine learning\nlearning using python i would very much\nrecommend this book to you\n",
