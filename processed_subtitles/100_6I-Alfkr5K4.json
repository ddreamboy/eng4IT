  "text": "hey everyone in this video we'll be\ntalking about NLP in the next 10 minutes\nso what can you expect from this video\nwhat's in it for you first we'll give\nyou a basic understanding of NLP we'll\ntell you why we need NLP and we'll talk\nabout what NLP exactly is next we'll\nlook at NLP pipelines NLP pipelines\ncover the basic processes involved in\ntext passing in NLP which means\nconverting text to a form suitable for\nmachines to understand as humans would\nunderstand it and finally we'll talk\nabout some real world applications of\nNLP which are all around us and a lot\nmore common than you might have realized\nso let's get started so what exactly is\nNLP before we talk about NLP let's talk\nabout how humans talk and interact with\neach other humans communicate with each\nother mostly via speech or text to\nconvey your intent to someone you may\ndirectly talk to them or send them a\nmessage the human way of communicating\nis known as natural language around the\nglobe many languages are spoken and\nmessages are shared virtually every\nsingle day all these conversations\nfeedbacks and messages are data in\nthemselves this data is extremely\nvaluable as it can give us customer\ninformation and insight into human\nsentiment\nhowever this data is not useful to\ncomputers as it is not in a form that\ncan be understood by machines machines\ncommunicate using ones and zeros and not\nvia words they cannot understand English\nFrench or Spanish only binary and this\nis where NLP comes into the picture NLP\nstands for natural language processing\nnatural language processing is a branch\nof artificial intelligence that deals\nwith the interactions between humans and\ncomputer\nusing the natural language the ultimate\nobjective of NLP is to read decipher\nunderstand and make sense of human\nlanguages in a manner that is valuable\nand to build systems that can make sense\nof text and perform tasks like\ntranslation grammar checking or topic\nclassification NLP basically is the task\nof processing written forms of languages\nand making a computer understand them\ncompanies are increasingly using NLP\nequipped tools to gain ins sites from\ndata and to automate routine tasks a\nsentiment analyzer for instance can help\nBrands detect emotions in text such as\nnegative comments on social\nmedia NLP at the end of the day is\nnothing more than accumulation of\nartificial intelligence computer science\nand the human language the next topic\nthat we'll be looking at are NLP\npipelines so what exactly are pipelines\na pipeline is a set of data process\nprocessing Elements which are connected\nin series where the output of one\nelement is the input of the next one it\nbasically represents the various steps\nwhich have to be taken in our\ncomputation and the order in which they\noccur in this pipeline we are going to\nbe passing our data parsing means\nconverting our data from one form to\nanother in this case we are passing our\ninput Text data to a file which can be\nunderstood by a computer the text is\nfirst broken into segments and the\nsegments are then converted into even\nsmaller\ntokens the word stems of all of these\ntokens are found followed by finding the\nroot words of these stems in a process\nknown as\nlemmatization we will then recognize\nwhich part of speech the word belongs to\nwhich means if the word is a verb a noun\nor a pronoun and finally we will\nseparate the instances of everyday\npopular entities\nfrom our words to better understand what\nthe sentence is trying to convey the\nfinal file that we'll get will be a file\nwhich will be understood by a computer\nsegmentation the first process of a\npipeline is segmentation now what\nexactly is\nsegmentation sentence segmentation or\ntext segmentation is basically dividing\nthe given text into logically\ndecipherable units of information we\ndivide the sentence into its constituent\nsub sent sentences usually along the\npunctuations like full stops or commas\nor along line breaks and Page components\nfor HTML files dividing a document into\nits constituent sentences allows us to\nprocess it without losing its Essence\nand the necessary information that it\ncontains in this case let's consider a\nsentence the lemonade quenched her\nthirst but not her longing after\nsentence segmentation we are going to\ndivide the sentence into two the first\nsentence is going to be the lemonade\nquenched her thirst and the second one\nis going to be but not her longing the\nnext step of our pipeline is called\ntokenization tokenization is nothing but\nthe process of dividing a sentence into\nits constituent words the sentence that\nis given to us will be separated and all\nthe words in the sentence will be stored\nseparately this is done so we can\nunderstand the syntactic and semantic\ninformation contain AED in each sentence\nthus we decipher the relevance of a\nsentence by analyzing it word by word\nthereby making sure that no loss of\ninformation occurs the computer does not\nunderstand punctuations and special\ncharacters hence we can remove any\npunctuations and special characters\nwhich may occur let's take a part of a\npreviously segmented sentence over here\nlet's consider the lemonade quenched her\nthirst after tokenization we are going\nto separate every single word in this\nsentence so after tokenization we are\ngoing to get five different tokens the\nlemonade quenched her and thirst all of\nthese are going to be treated as\nseparate entities after tokenization we\nperform stemming stemming is a process\nof obtaining the word stems of a word\nword stems are also known as the base\nform of a word and we can create new\nwords by attaching a fixes to them in a\nprocess known as inflection St is a\nprocess of recognizing the word stems of\nindividual words this is done by\nremoving affixes such as in s ed etc for\nexample consider our sentence jump jump\nis the word stem of various different\nwords like jumping jumped and jumps if\nwe remove all of these affixes we will\nget our basic word stem which is Jump\nthis is basically what we want at the\nend of stemming the next process in our\npipeline is called lemmatization\nlemmatization is the process of figuring\nout the root form or root word which is\nnothing but the most basic form also\nknown as the LMA of each word in the\nsentence lemmatization is very similar\nto stemming where we remove word a fixes\nto get the base form of a word the\ndifference is that the root word is\nalways a word which is present in the\ndictionary but the root stem may not be\nso lemmatization uses a knowledge BAS\nBase called word net let's consider\nthree different words went going and\ngone at the end of the day all of these\nwords have originated from a single word\nwhich is go in this case go is our Lemma\nall the other words which are derived\nfrom go can be traced back to it the\nnext part of a pipeline is called part\nof speech tagging part of speech tagging\nis a process of converting a sentence to\ndifferent forms it can be a list of\nwords or a list of\ntuples the tag in case of is a part of\nspeech tag and signifies whether the\nword is a noun adjective verb and so on\nwe are basically splitting our verbs\ninto their grammatical components to\nunderstand the meaning of any sentence\nor to extract relationships and to build\na Knowledge Graph part of speech tagging\nis a very important step as the same\nword can have different part of speeches\nin different\nsentences for example let's consider\nthis sentence give me your answer in\nthis sentence answer is a noun but if\nyou consider another sentence answer the\nquestion over here answer will be a verb\nusing part of speech tagging we can take\nour different tokens and find the\ndifferent part of speech that it belongs\nto in this case the is a determiner\nlemonade is a noun quenched is a verb\nher is a pronoun and thirst is a noun\nthe final step in our NLP pipeline that\nwe are looking at here is nothing but\nnamed entity recognition named entity\nrecognition also known as named entity\nidentification entity chunking and\nentity extraction is a subtask of\ninformation extraction that seeks to\nlocate and classify named entities which\nare mentioned in unstructured text into\npredefined categories extracting the\nmain entities in a text helps us sort\nunstructured data and detect important\ninformation which is crucial if you have\nto deal with large data sets the\nsubcategories that we are considering\nare person whether the named entity is a\nperson whether it's a quantity like\nkilograms a\nlocation an\norganization the name of a movie or\nwhether it's a monetary value like\ndollars or euros\nso far we've looked at what NLP is and\nhow we can perform natural language\nprocessing but what are some\napplications of it and where is it used\nin the real\nworld one of the applications of NLP is\nin chatbots chatbots can help you solve\nissues while performing natural language\ngeneration in other words they can hold\na conversation in plain English a\nchatbot is nothing but a software\napplication which can be used to conduct\nan online chat CH conversation either\nthrough text or speech in place of\nproviding direct contact with a life\nhuman agent you might have seen those\ntalk to one of our agents section on\nwebsites those are usually chat Bots a\nlot of companies also use WhatsApp chat\nBots to make the process seem less\nmechanical another application of NLP is\nspeech recognition probably the most\npopular example of NLP in action are\nvirtual assistants like Google assist\nSiri and Alexa natural language\nprocessing understands and translates\nthe human language like Hey Siri where\nis the nearest gas station into numbers\nmaking it easy for machines to\nunderstand they recognize when you are\ntalking converting speech to text and\nunderstand what you requested over the\nyears virtual assistants have become\nstreamlined enough to be able to emulate\nhuman speech patterns almost flawlessly\nanother application of NLP is\nautocorrect\nautoc correction also known as text\nreplacement replace as you type or\nsimply autocorrect is an automatic data\nvalidation function commonly found in\nword processors and text editing\ninterfaces for smartphones and tablet\ncomputers it acts as a spell check and\ncorrects any spellings or grammar\nmistakes which may arise as you are\ntyping some language check softwares\nlike grammarly paper rator reverso and\nothers can even check how unique and\nengaging your articles are and all of\nthis is done using NLP now this brings\nus to the end of this video on NLP in 10\nminutes we hope that the video was\nuseful to your journey to learning NLP\nto learn more about natural language\nprocessing and related topics you
