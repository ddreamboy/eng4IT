  "text": "foreign\nintroduction to cyber security\nFrameworks in today's digital age cyber\nsecurity has become a top priority for\nindividuals and organizations alike with\nthe increasing number of cyber threats\nand attacks it is essential to have a\ncomprehensive cyber security framework\nin place to protect sensitive\ninformation and data cyber security\nFrameworks provide a structured approach\nto managing and mitigating cyber risks\nby outlining best practices guidelines\nand standards in this article we will\nexplore three of the most widely used\ncyber security Frameworks this cyber\nsecurity framework ISO 270001\ninformation security management system\nand CIS controls for Effective cyber\ndefense by understanding these\nFrameworks you can better protect\nyourself and your organization from\ncyber threats and ensure that your cyber\nsecurity measures are up to par with\nindustry standards\n2. this cyber security framework\nthe nist cyber security framework is a\nset of guidelines and best practices\ndesigned to help organizations manage\nand reduce cyber security risks it was\ndeveloped by the National Institute of\nStandards and Technology NISD in\nresponse to executive order\n13636 which call for the creation of a\nframework that would help critical\ninfrastructure organizations improve\ntheir cyber security posture the\nframework consists of five core\nfunctions identify protect protect\nrespond and recover each function is\nfurther broken down into categories and\nsubcategories that provide more specific\nguidance on how to implement the\nframework\nthe identify function focuses on\nunderstanding an organization's cyber\nsecurity risks and vulnerabilities this\nincludes identifying all assets systems\nand data that need to be protected as\nwell as assessing the potential impact\nof a Cyber attack\nthe protect function involves\nimplementing safeguards to protect\nagainst cyber threats this includes\nmeasures such as access controls\nencryption and security awareness\ntraining for employees\nthe detect function involves monitoring\nsystems and networks for signs of a\nCyber attack this includes implementing\nintrusion detection and prevention\nsystems as well as conducting regular\nvulnerability scans and penetration\ntesting\nthe respond function involves developing\nand implementing a plan to respond to a\nCyber attack this includes establishing\nan incident Response Team defining roles\nand responsibilities and developing\nprocedures for containing and mitigating\nthe effects of an attack\nfinally recover function involves\nrestoring normal operations after a\nCyber attack this includes developing a\nbusiness continuity plan conducting\nbackups of critical data and ensuring\nthat systems can be quickly restored in\nthe event of an outage overall the nist\ncyber security framework provides a\ncomprehensive approach to managing cyber\nsecurity risks by following its\nguidelines and best practices\norganizations can better protect\nthemselves against cyber threats and\nensure the confidentiality integrity and\navailability of their sensitive data 3.\nISO 27001 information security\nmanagement system the iso 27001\ninformation security management system\nis a globally recognized framework that\nprovides a systematic approach to\nmanaging sensitive information it\noutlines a set of best practices for\nestablishing implementing maintaining\nand continually improving an\norganization's information security\nmanagement system the frame work is\ndesigned to help organizations identify\nand manage risk to their information\nassets including confidential data\nintellectual property and customer\ninformation it also helps ensure\ncompliance with legal Regulatory and\ncontractual requirements related to\ninformation security\nISO 27001 consists of several key\ncomponents including risk assessment and\ntreatment security controls and\ncontinuous Improvement the framework\nemphasizes the importance of a\nrisk-based approach to information\nsecurity which involves identifying\npotential threats and vulnerabilities\nassessing the likelihood and impact of\nthose risks and implementing appropriate\ncontrols to mitigate them one of the\nstrengths of iso 27001 is its\nflexibility the framework can be adapted\nto suit the specific needs of different\norganizations regardless of their size\nindustry or location it can also be\nintegrated with other management systems\nsuch as quality management or\nEnvironmental Management to create a\ncomprehensive approach to organizational\ngovernance\noverall the iso 27001 information\nsecurity management system is a valuable\ntool for organizations looking to\nestablish a robust and effective\ninformation security program by\nfollowing the framework's guidelines\norganizations can better protect their\nsensitive information reduce the risk of\ncyber attacks and demonstrate their\ncommitment to security to stakeholders\nand customers alike\n4. CIS controls for Effective cyber\ndefense the center for Internet Security\nCas controls is a set of best practices\ndesigned to help organizations protect\ntheir systems and data from cyber\nthreats the controls are organized into\nthree categories basic foundational and\norganizational\nthe basic controls include measures such\nas inventory and control of Hardware\nassets inventory and control of software\nassets continuous vulnerability\nmanagement and controlled use of\nadministrative privileges these controls\nare considered essential for any\norganization that wants to establish a\nstrong cyber security posture\nthe foundational controls build upon the\nbasic controls and include measures such\nas email and web browser protections\nmalware defenses data recovery\ncapabilities and secure configurations\nfor network devices these controls are\ndesigned to provide additional layers of\nprotection against common cyber threats\nfinally organizational controls focus on\nthe policies procedures and training\nnecessary to maintain an effective cyber\nsecurity program these controls include\nmeasures such as security awareness\ntraining incident response planning and\npenetration testing by implementing the\nsys controls organizations can establish\na comprehensive cyber security program\nthat addresses both Technical and\norganizational aspects of security the\ncontrols are regularly updated based on\nnew threats and vulnerabilities ensuring\nthat organizations stay up to date with\nthe latest best practices in cyber\nsecurity\nforeign\n[Music]\n",
