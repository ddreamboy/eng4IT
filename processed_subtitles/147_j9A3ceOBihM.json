more and book a free\nconsultation with a\nfriendly coach at www.gradcoach.com\nalright with that out of the way let's\nget into it\nto understand qualitative data analysis\nwe need to understand qualitative data\nso let's take a step back and ask the\nquestion what\nexactly is qualitative data well\nqualitative data\nrefers to pretty much any data that's\nnot numbers\nin other words it's not stuff that you\nmeasure using a\nfixed scale or complex statistics or\nmathematics\nso if it's not numbers what is it\nwords you guessed well sometimes yes\nqualitative data can and often does take\nthe form of\ninterview transcripts documents and\nopen-ended survey responses\nbut it can also involve the\ninterpretation of\nimages and videos in other words\nqualitative data\nisn't just limited to text-based data so\nhow's that different from quantitative\ndata well simply\nput qualitative research focuses on\nwords descriptions concepts or ideas\nwhile quantitative research focuses on\nnumbers\nand statistics qualitative research\ninvestigates the\nsofter side of things to explore and\ndescribe\nwhile quantitative research focuses on\nthe hard\nnumbers to measure differences between\nvariables\nand the relationships between them if\nyou're keen to learn more about the\ndifferences between\nqual and quant we've got a detailed post\nover on the grad coach blog\ni'll include a link below now you might\nbe thinking\nqualitative is probably easier than\nquantitative\nright well not quite in many ways\nqualitative data can be incredibly\nchallenging and\ntime consuming to analyze and interpret\nat the end of your data collection phase\nwhich takes a lot of time in and of\nitself\nyou'll likely have pages and pages of\ntext-based data or hours upon hours of\naudio to work through\nyou might have subtle nuances of\ninteractions or discussions\nthat have danced around in your mind or\nthat you've scribbled down in messy\nfield notes\nmaking sense of all of this is no small\ntask\nand you shouldn't underestimate it so\nlong story short\nqualitative analysis can be a lot of\nwork\ndon't stress though in this video we'll\nexplore qualitative data analysis\nqda for short by looking at the six most\npopular analysis methods these qda\nmethods can be used on\nprimary data data you've collected\nyourself or secondary data\ndata that's already been published by\nsomeone else so\nwithout further delay let's get into it\nright let's start by outlining the\nanalysis methods and then we'll\ndive into the details for each one the\nsix most popular qda methods\nor at least the ones we see at grad\ncoach are\nnumber one qualitative content analysis\nnumber two narrative analysis number\nthree discourse analysis number four\nthematic analysis number five\ngrounded theory and number six\nipa if that all sounds like gibberish\ndon't worry we will explore each of them\nin this video\nso let's do it\nfirst up is a qda method called\nqualitative content analysis\nor just content analysis for short\ncontent analysis is possibly the most\ncommon and straightforward qda method at\nthe simplest level\ncontent analysis is used to evaluate\npatterns within a piece of content\nfor example words phrases or images\nor across multiple pieces of content or\nsources of communication\nfor example a collection of newspaper\narticles or political speeches\nwith content analysis you could for\ninstance\nidentify the frequency with which an\nidea\nis shared or spoken about like the\nnumber of times a kardashian is\nmentioned on twitter\nor you could identify patterns of deeper\nunderlying interpretations for instance\nby\nidentifying phrases or words in tourist\npamphlets\nthat highlight india as an ancient\ncountry\nbecause content analysis can be used in\nsuch a wide variety of ways\nit's important to go into your analysis\nwith a very specific\nquestion and goal or you'll get lost in\nthe fog\nwith content analysis you'll group large\namounts of text\ninto codes summarize these into\ncategories\nand possibly even tabulate the data to\ncalculate the frequency\nof certain concepts or variables because\nof this\ncontent analysis provides a small splash\nof quantitative thinking within\na qualitative method naturally while\ncontent analysis is\nwidely useful it's not without drawbacks\none of the main issues with content\nanalysis is that it can be\nvery time consuming as it requires lots\nof reading and\nre-reading of the text also because of\nits multi-dimensional focus\non both qualitative and quantitative\naspects\nit is sometimes accused of losing\nimportant nuances in communication\ncontent analysis also tends to\nconcentrate on a\nvery specific timeline and doesn't take\ninto account what happened before\nor after that timeline this isn't\nnecessarily a bad\nthing though just something to be aware\nof so keep these factors in mind if\nyou're considering content analysis\nevery analysis method has its drawbacks\nso don't be put off by these\njust be aware of them\nright let's take a look at the next qda\nmethod\nnarrative analysis\nokay next in line we have a powerful\nqualitative analysis method called\nnarrative analysis\nas the name suggests narrative analysis\nis all about\nlistening to people telling stories and\nanalyzing what that means\nsince stories serve a functional purpose\nof helping us make sense of the world\nwe can gain insights into the ways that\npeople deal with\nand make sense of reality by analyzing\ntheir stories and the ways they're told\nyou could\nfor example use narrative analysis to\nexplore whether\nhow something being said is important\nfor instance the narrative of a prisoner\ntrying to justify their crime\ncould provide insight into their view of\nthe world and the justice system\nsimilarly analyzing the ways\nentrepreneurs talk\nabout the struggles in their careers or\ncancer patients telling stories of hope\ncould provide powerful insights into\ntheir mindsets\nand perspectives in other words\nnarrative analysis\nis about paying attention to the stories\nthat people tell and\nmore importantly the way they tell them\nof course the narrative approach has its\nweaknesses just like\nall analysis methods sample sizes are\ngenerally quite small due to the\ntime-consuming process\nof capturing narratives because of this\nalong with the multitude of social and\nlifestyle factors\nwhich can influence a subject narrative\nanalysis can be quite difficult to\nreproduce in subsequent research this\nmeans that it's difficult to test the\nfindings of some of this research\nsimilarly research bias can have a\nstrong\ninfluence on the results here so you\nneed to be particularly careful\nabout the potential biases that you can\nbring\ninto your analysis when using this\nmethod nevertheless\nnarrative analysis is still a very\nuseful\nqualitative method just keep these\nlimitations in mind and be careful\nnot to draw broad conclusions\nall right let's take a look at the next\nqda method\ndiscourse analysis\nnumber three on the list is discourse\nanalysis\ndiscourse is simply a fancy word for\nwritten or spoken language or debate so\ndiscourse analysis is all about\nanalyzing\nlanguage within its social context in\nother words\nanalyzing language such as a\nconversation a speech etc\nwithin the culture and society it takes\nplace in\nfor example you could analyze how a\njanitor speaks to a ceo\nor how politicians speak about terrorism\nto truly understand these conversations\nor speeches\nthe culture and history of those\ninvolved in the communication\nis important for example a janitor\nmight speak more casually with the ceo\nin a company that emphasizes equality\namong workers similarly a politician\nmight speak\nmore about terrorism if there was a\nrecent\nterrorist incident in the country so as\nyou can see\nby using discourse analysis you can\nidentify\nhow culture history or power dynamics to\nname a few\nhave an effect on the way concepts are\nspoken about\nso if your research aims and objectives\ninvolve\nunderstanding culture or power dynamics\ndiscourse analysis can be a powerful\nmethod\nbecause there are many social influences\nin how we speak to each other\nthe potential use of discourse analysis\nis\nvast of course this also means it's\nimportant to have\na very specific research question\nor questions in mind when analyzing your\ndata\nand looking for patterns and themes or\nyou\nmight end up going down a winding rabbit\nhole\ndiscourse analysis can also be very time\nconsuming as you need to sample the data\nto the point of saturation\nin other words until no new information\nand insights emerge but this is of\ncourse\npart of what makes discourse analysis\nsuch a powerful technique\nso keep these factors in mind when\nconsidering\nthis qda method\nright so far we've covered content\nanalysis\nnarrative analysis which analyzes\nstories\nand discourse analysis which analyzes\nconversations and interactions\nnext up we've got thematic analysis\nwhich focuses on themes and patterns\nlet's jump into that\nthematic analysis looks at patterns of\nmeaning in a data set\nfor example a set of interviews or focus\ngroup transcripts\nbut what exactly does that mean well a\nthematic analysis takes bodies of data\nwhich are often quite large\nand groups them according to\nsimilarities\nin other words themes these themes help\nus make sense of the context and derive\nmeaning from it\nlet's take a look at an example with\nthematic analysis you could analyze\n100 reviews of a popular sushi\nrestaurant\nto find out what patrons think about the\nplace by reviewing the data\nyou would then identify the themes that\ncrop up repeatedly within the data\nfor example fresh ingredients or\nfriendly wait\nstaff so as you can see thematic\nanalysis can be\npretty useful for finding out about\npeople's experiences\nviews and opinions therefore if your\nresearch aims and objectives\ninvolve understanding people's\nexperience or\nview of something thematic analysis can\nbe a great\nchoice systematic analysis is a bit of\nan exploratory process\nit's not unusual for your research\nquestions to develop or even change as\nyou progress\nthrough the analysis while this is\nsomewhat natural in exploratory research\nit can also be seen as a disadvantage as\nit means that the data\nneeds to be re-reviewed each time a\nresearch question is adjusted\nso basically thematic analysis can be\nquite time consuming but for a good\nreason\nso keep this in mind if you choose to\nuse thematic analysis\nfor your project and budget extra time\nfor\nunexpected adjustments\nright let's hop on to the next qda\nmethod of choice\ngrounded theory\nall right it's time to get grounded well\nkinda grounded theory is a powerful\nqualitative analysis method where the\nintention is to create a\nnew theory or theories using the data at\nhand\nthrough a series of tests and revisions\nfor example you could try to develop a\ntheory about what factors\ninfluence students to watch a youtube\nvideo about\nqualitative analysis the important thing\nwith grounded theory\nis that you go into the analysis with an\nopen mind\nand let the data speak for itself rather\nthan dragging\nin existing hypotheses or theories into\nyour analysis\nin other words your analysis must\ndevelop from the ground\nup hence the name in grounded theory you\nstart with a\ngeneral overarching question about a\ngiven population\nfor example graduate students then you\nbegin to analyze a small sample like\nfive graduate students in a department\nat a university\nideally this sample should be reasonably\nrepresentative of the broader population\nyou'd then interview these students to\nidentify what factors led them to watch\nthe video\nafter analyzing the interview data a\ngeneral hypothesis\nor pattern could emerge you might notice\nthat graduate students are more likely\nto read a post about qualitative methods\nif they are just starting on their\ndissertation journey\nor if they have an upcoming test about\nresearch methods\nfrom here you'll look for another small\nsample\nmaybe five more graduate students in a\ndifferent department\nand see whether this pattern or this\nhypothesis holds true for them\nif not you'll look for more\ncommonalities and adapt your theory\naccordingly\nas this process continues the theory\ndevelops\nwhat's important with grounded theory is\nthat the theory develops from the data\nnot from some preconceived idea you need\nto let the data\nspeak for itself so what are the\ndrawbacks of grounded theory\nwell some do argue that there's a tricky\ncircularity to grounded theory\nfor it to work in principle you should\nknow as\nlittle as possible regarding the\nresearch question and population\nthis helps you reduce the amount of bias\nin your interpretation\nhowever in many circumstances it's also\nthought to be very\nunwise to approach a research question\nwithout knowledge of the current\nliterature\nso basically it's a bit of a chicken\nor the egg situation regardless grounded\ntheory remains a popular\nand a powerful option it can be a very\nuseful method when you're researching a\ntopic that is completely new\nor has very little existing research\nabout it\nit allows you to start from scratch and\nwork your way from the ground\nup\nright time for us to move on to the\nfinal qualitative analysis method\nipa let's jump into it\ninterpretive phenomenological analysis\nipa okay no let's just stick with ipa\nokay ipa is designed to help you\nunderstand the personal experiences of a\nsubject\nfor example a person or a group of\npeople\nconcerning a major life event an\nexperience or a situation\nthis event or experience is the\nphenomenon or\nphenomena that makes up the p in\nipa these phenomena may range from\nrelatively\ncommon experiences such as motherhood or\nbeing involved in a car accident\nto those which are extremely rare for\nexample\nsomeone's personal experience in a\nrefugee camp\nso ipa is a great choice if\nyour research involves analyzing\npeople's\npersonal experiences of something that\nhappened to them\nit's important to remember that ipa is\nsubject centered it's focused on the\nexperiencer\nthis means that while you'll likely use\na coding system to identify\ncommonalities\nit is important not to lose the depth of\nexperience\nor meaning by trying to reduce\neverything to codes\nalso keep in mind that since your sample\nsize will generally be\nvery small with ipa you often will\nnot be able to draw a broad conclusions\nabout the generalizability of your\nfindings\nbut that's okay as long as it aligns\nwith your research aims\nand objectives now another thing to be\naware of with ipa\nis personal bias while researcher bias\ncan creep into all forms of research\nself-awareness is critically important\nwith ipa\nas it can have a major impact on the\nresults\nfor example a researcher who was a\nvictim of a crime himself\ncould insert his own feelings of\nfrustration\nand anger into the way that he\ninterprets the experience of someone who\nwas kidnapped\nso if you're going to undertake ipa you\nneed to be\nvery self-aware or you could muddy the\nanalysis\nkeep these limitations and pitfalls in\nmind and you\nwill have a powerful analysis tool in\nyour arsenal\nall right so there we have it the six\nmost popular qualitative data analysis\nmethods\nthat we work with here at grad coach so\nat this point you're probably asking\nyourself the question\nhow do i choose the right one well\nselecting the right\nqualitative analysis method largely\ndepends\non your research aims objectives and\nquestions\nin other words the best tool for the job\ndepends on what you're trying to build\nfor example perhaps your research aims\nto\nanalyze the use of words and what they\nreveal about the intention of the\nstoryteller and the cultural context of\nthe time\nperhaps your research aims to develop an\nunderstanding\nof the unique personal experiences of\npeople that have experienced a certain\nevent\nor perhaps your research aims to develop\ninsight regarding the influence of a\ncertain culture on its members\nas you can see all of these research\naims are distinctly different\nand therefore different analysis methods\nwould be suitable for each one\nalso remember that each method has its\nown strengths\nweaknesses and general limitations\nno single analysis method is perfect\nso it often makes sense to adopt more\nthan one method\nthis is called triangulation but this\nis also quite time consuming\nas we've seen these approaches all make\nuse of coding and\ntheme generating techniques but the\nintent\nand approach of each analysis method\ndiffers quite substantially\nso it is really important to come into\nyour research\nwith a clear intention before you even\nstart thinking about which analysis\nmethod\nor methods to use start by reviewing\nyour research\naims objectives and research questions\nto assess what exactly you're trying to\nfind out\nthen select a method that fits never\npick\na method just because you like it or\nhave experience\nusing it your analysis method or\nanalysis methods\nmust align with your broader research\naims and objectives\nokay so let's quickly recap on the six\nmethods firstly we looked at content\nanalysis\na straightforward method that blends a\nlittle bit of quant\ninto a primarily qualitative analysis\nthen we looked at narrative analysis\nwhich is about analyzing how\nstories are told next up was discourse\nanalysis\nwhich is about analyzing conversations\nand\ninteractions then we moved on to\nthematic analysis which is about\nidentifying\nthemes and patterns from there we went\nsouth with grounded theory which is\nabout starting from scratch\nwith a specific question and using the\ndata\nalone to build a theory in response to\nthat question\nand finally we looked at ipa\nwhich is about understanding people's\nunique experiences\nof a phenomenon now of course these\naren't the\nonly approaches to qualitative data\nanalysis\nbut they are a great starting point if\nyou're just\ndipping your toes into the waters
