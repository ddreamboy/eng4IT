  "text": "hello everyone thanks for joining the\nsession\nso as all of you know this is conducted\nby figurative on top of blockchain and\nits application so as part of this\nagenda we'll be discussing about\nblockchain what are the different\napplications of blockchain what is the\ntechnology stack we have on blockchain\nand we'll also take an example of how do\nwe\nuse or what are the different cases that\nwe we use a hands-on on this part okay\nso now let's talk about this blockchain\nso let's try to talk about what is a\nblockchain so blockchain is a technology\nwhich is introduced\nbasically by\nthe technology called bitcoin so where\npeople will end up with creating the\nnumber of blocks and it will change\nwhich means every block each and every\nblock will be attached to each and every\nblock which is next to it so unless\notherwise you cannot\nif your first block is starting and your\nyour block will continue to grow and you\nknow that what is the start of it what\nis the end of that which means every\nblock will contain the information of\nstart of the block and end of the block\nso which means in that case if you are\nsupposed to know what is the entire\nblockchain you are supposed to hack the\nentire blockchain system and which is\npractically not possible by anybody so\nthat's where that's what we typically\ncall it as a blockchain technology and\nit's a concept which can be implemented\nby any language which means it's not a\nlanguage barrier or anything you can use\nany technology or any programming\nlanguage to implement it and it is\nsomething which is mostly preferred\nimplement some programming that can help\nyou to create a blockchains okay so in\nany blockchain so you'll end up with\nhaving all the transactions log\nincluding the information based on the\ndate and time and everything so that\neach and every transaction can be\nvisible and you'll be able to verify\nwhenever you wanted to and there will be\nsomething called endnote work and not\nnetwork won't full copy of the block\nchange and you'll end up with having\neach node will contain the network of a\nfull copy of the blockchain so that uh\neven if someone tried to hack it and you\nbecause of the reason that it has to\nhold the entire full blockchain and one\nwill be done\nso now there are different types of\ntechnologies in the blockchain itself\nyou are supposed to have different types\nof processes which are enabled which\nmeans your transactions will be verified\nby the venus which means power is\nactually going to mine your or start\nmining your transactions or which are\npresent and it will be verified by each\nand every miner so that once each and\nevery miner confirms that okay this is\nthe right block that we're trying to add\nthat we're trying to achieve and that's\nwhen it will be verified and if at all\nthere is any attempt to which someone is\ntrying to make a corruption or anything\nobviously you may not be able to go and\nget all the information for all the\nblocks and obviously it will start\ntrading so that nobody will be able to\nadd or either break anything as part of\nthe chain because any transaction can be\nenabled only by verifying all the\ntransactions as part of the check right\nso uh now uh what are the different\napplications which are implemented using\nthese blockchains and there are a lot of\napple applications especially the api uh\ndifferent different apis especially if\nyou take a look at uh how the\ntransactions are being happening or how\nthese organizations are making a lot of\ntransactions to make sure that nobody\nwill hack it mostly or nobody will will\nblock them unnecessarily and you will\nend up with using all these applications\nsimply using these apis\nand uh if\nat all there is a\ndecentralized application especially\nthere is a decentralized situation the\nmajor advantage is so it's not something\nthat somebody can go and uh block it or\nhack it because it's not something that\na particular private person or regular\norganization will want to own it and it\nis something which will be owned by the\nanti-network of the people so that it is\nnot something that is possible for\nanyone to shut it down or go to go and\nstart controlling it unless otherwise if\neverybody started not to use it so\nthat's what we typically call as\ndecentralization so that's where there\nis no regularization regulations that\npeople can transfer so it's on the\ntechnology stack wise and you'll end up\nwith having a different technologies and\nwe have different different technologies\nlike javascript or any kind of\ntechnology that you can use which can\nintegrate with your blockchain\ntechnology and with your\napplications enough for doing this\nand anatomy of this so where you'll end\nup with having marketing agreement and\nthere is no need of a broker or any\nlawyer so you can just structure\nconsidering that you have a block which\nis associated with you you can continue\nto use it and there is no documentation\neverything which is required you can\ncontinue to warn\nwhich is available which is actually\npart of your blockchain and you can\ncomplete it and you can continue to take\nyour backup and you can also continue to\nhave duplicates also but only thing is\nthat once you you cannot create a new\none as part of it and the accuracy is\ngoing to be 100 and it cannot be avoided\nit's something because of anywhere\nso and you'll also have a concept called\nblock verify so what is the verify means\naudible by\ncounterfeits or are there no duplicates\nor company verify or global solutions\nthere are different types of\nverifications which are available and\nwhich are differently used by different\ndifferent technologies which can help\nyou to build different different um type\nof applications so counterfeit boots or\ndiversified products or the stolen\nmerchandise or the foreign transactions\ncan be can continue to be verified as\npart of their blockchain so that these\nkind of activities can be controlled\nvery well\nand of course as i said there are\ndifferent type of applications which are\nbuilt using this and one of the example\nis ripple which is one of the coin which\nis created uh one of the digital\ncurrency i mean so the ripple network is\nsomething which is instrumental payment\nfor the providers such as bankers or\nmoney solutions which have been given uh\nit is unreliable so uh which means that\nokay whatever the people who want to use\nit\none of the blockchain one of the digital\ncurrency which is created it's\ninexpensive it's very expensive and it's\nalso slow because of the reason that it\nis slow in terms of processing and\nanything and it may not be that easy for\npeople to hack because you may have to\nverify all the transactions and that's\nwhere you'll have access to transactions\nwhich are being promised by the network\nwill be the network will be and you'll\nend up with having the access faster\naccess to it and then you'll be able to\naccess you'll be able to make\ntransactions very faster and it is also\nhighly reliable and lower cost and it\nwill take all the disadvantages of\navailable off on top of it and it's\ngoing to you end up with having the\ntransactions over ripple network which\npromises that okay you can achieve all\nthese accesses and faster process and\nthe lower cost accuracy so likewise\nthere are a different type of\napplications like scotch and you can\nalso continue to use uh different\ndifferent ways of dealing with them\nright you'll have other advantages of\nhaving the transactions completely\ncheaper and then after we maintain\nprivate and we have a faster face which\nmeans everything the transactions can be\nverified very faster\nand you can primarily use them for as\npart of your encryption and in case if\nyou want to start an information which\ncan which nobody can recollect it once\nyou start it i can continue to use them\nand you'll also have audits which means\nthat we can continue to have continuous\nauditing to make sure that the things\nare working and is also highly\ndistributed which means and when it's a\ndistributed unit obviously you can\ncontinue to get a factor in extreme\nso likewise we have a few other concepts\nlike auger or other things you can kind\nof use it and they have their own\nadvantages like our weather prediction\nwhich typically can be used for\npolitical forecasting and even heading a\ncompany forecasting so likewise these\nkind of applications can be used uh\nthese are the examples of the old\napplications that are being used\nokay so what are the things that you'll\nend up with learning when you're going\nthrough the recovery banner page what\nare the themes that you will end up with\nso you will have start with origin of\nworking with the blockchain and you will\nattend you can learn about\ncryptocurrency and blockchain\napplications and you have a hands-on in\neach and every part as you can see and\nthen you will understand about what is\nthe bitcoin platform how exactly the\nbitcoin platform is built and you'll\nalso start looking at what is the\nbitcoin mining how do we start with\nbitcoin and i think whatever you'll\nunderstand the basics of it and then you\nthe very famous and very much widely\nused you know blockchain concept uh of\nthis currency\nand you'll continue to learn about\nethereum and how the basic scholarship\nwill be implemented in the theory and\nwhat are the advantages of it how to\nimplement it using a hands-on experience\nand what are the advantages of it okay\nso and then you will continue to using\ntuple and this is one of the handsome\nthat you're thinking\nthat can help us to implement one of the\nemployees\nand as part of it you'll end up with\nhyperledger concepts as part of the\noverall session you'll end up with\nlearning all these concepts along with\nthe hearts along with the hands-on\nsessions and this is the entire course\npart of the entire roadway roadmap that\nyou're going to learn as part of your\nsessions okay so uh once you continue\ncontinuing with that and that's where we\nwill continue to become master\nunderstood\nokay so that's the overall process and\nyou'll also have multiple examples of um\natlanta which you have zero service\ncharge decentralized for or restrictions\nor anything\nokay so that's what you have so these\nare the different different activities\nthat you'll end up with learning as part\nof your usual um\nokay yeah thank you very much now\nlimitless for your blockchain\nyou\n",
