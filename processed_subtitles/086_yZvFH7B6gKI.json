video we're going to cover five key points \nto give you a better understanding of what it is  \nto be a Data Analyst and how do you start working \nin this field as you're watching the video

get more  \nweekly videos like this so let's dive into step \nnumber one perhaps you're thinking about becoming  \na data analyst and want to know exactly what a \ncareer in the field involves most companies are  \ncollecting loads of data all the time but in its \nraw form this data doesn't actually mean anything  \nthis is where data analytics comes in data \nanalytics is the process of analyzing raw data  \nso that we can pull out insights which are useful \nto companies these insights are super important to  \ndrive smart business decisions what a data analyst \ndoes is they take all this complex jigsaw of data  \nthey take it out and they make it into \nsomething which you can really use  \nhaving interpreted the data the data analyst can \nthen pass these insights on so that the company  \ncan then make the most informed decisions \nso you can think of data analytics as a  \nkind of business intelligence used to solve \nproblems and challenges that every company has  \nit's all about finding patterns in the data which \ncan tell you something useful or relevant about  \nthe business operations so for instance how \ncustomers engage with a particular product or  \nemployees engage with a particular tool armed with \nthe insights of data companies are then able to  \nmake better decisions about their audience company \nas a whole and the industry in which they work in\nStep one we looked at what Data Analytics \nactually is in step two we're going to look  \nat how data analytics is used so what does data \nanalytics actually look like in action and how is  \nit used in the real world so the fact is data is \neverywhere so it actually has an infinite amount  \nof uses across all kinds of businesses and \norganizations globally broadly speaking data  \nanalytics is used to make faster and better \nbusiness decisions to reduce overall business  \ncosts and to develop new and innovative products \nand services in more specific terms data analytics  \nmight be used to do the following to predict \nfuture sales or purchasing behaviors for security  \npurposes to help and protect against fraud to \nanalyze the effectiveness of marketing campaigns  \nto boost customer acquisition and retention or \nto increase supply chain efficiency so that gives  \nyou a little bit of an overview of what data \nanalytics can be used for in the real world\nStep three let's dive into what a data \nanalyst actually does on a day-to-day basis  \nif you're thinking about becoming a data analyst \nyou're probably interested in the roles and  \nresponsibilities that you'll have in the field \nbased on some real job ads here are some typical  \nroles and responsibilities that you'll have to \nundertake as a data analyst manage the delivery  \nof user satisfaction surveys and report on \nresults using data visualization software  \nwork with business line owners to develop \nrequirements define success metrics  \nmanage and execute analytical projects and \nevaluate results monitor practices processes  \nand systems to identify opportunities for \nimprovement translate important questions  \ninto concrete analytical tasks gather new \ndata to answer client questions collating  \nand organizing data from multiple sources \ndesign build test and maintain back-end code  \nestablish data processes define data quality \ncriteria and implement data quality processes  \nwork as part of a team to evaluate and analyze key \ndata that will be used to shape future business  \nstrategies so those are just some examples of what \na data analyst would be doing in any given role  \nto learn more about the kinds of things that \nyou'll be undertaking as a data analyst why  \nnot search on job boards like linkedin indeed \nand icrunchdata.com so that was step three  \nit was just a broad overview of what you \ncan expect to be doing as a data analyst\nSo now we've looked at data analytics as a role \nwe're now going to go into the process of data  \nanalysis so now we're going to outline \nthe five main steps a data analyst would  \ntake when approaching a new project step one \ndefine the questions that you want to answer  \nyou need to answer why you're conducting this \nanalysis and what questions and answers you  \nneed to find at this stage you'll take a clearly \ndefined problem and then you'll make a hypothesis  \nor research question that you can go on and \nanswer you'll then need to identify what types  \nof data you'll need but importantly where it \nwill come from for instance a business problem  \nmight be that customers aren't subscribing to \na paid membership once that free trial ends  \nyour key question can then be what kind \nof strategies can the business implement  \nto retain their customer base step two would be \nto collect this data with a clear question in mind  \nyou're ready to start collecting that data data \nanalysts will usually gather data from primary  \nsources or internal data that the company already \nhas such as CRM software or email marketing tools  \nthey may tend to secondary or external sources \nsuch as open data sources so this can include  \ndata from government portals tools like \ngoogle trends but also data from international  \norganizations like the world health organization \nso step three you need to clean scrub that data  \nonce you've got that data you need to prepare \nit and ready it for analysis your original data  \nmight include duplicates anomalies or missing data \nwhich could distort how the data is interpreted  \nthese all need to be removed data cleaning can be \na manual task and it can take some time but it's  \ncrucial if you want to get the right business \ninsights step four is to analyze the data now  \nfor the actual analysis how you analyze the data \nwill depend on the question that you're asking  \nand the kind of data that you're working \nwith but some common techniques include  \nregression analysis cluster analysis and time \nseries analysis to name just a few we're going to  \ngo into these analysis terms much deeper in future \nvideos but if you have any specific questions now  \ndrop us a comment in the comments below moving \non to step 5 we need to interpret and share the  \nresults the final step in this process is where \ndata is turned into valuable business insights  \ndepending on the type of analysis conducted you'll \npresent your findings in a way that others can  \nunderstand in the form of a chart or a graph for \nexample at this stage you'll be able to say what  \nthe data analysis actually shows you in regards \nto your initial question or business challenge  \nand you'll collaborate with key stakeholders \non how to move forward this is a great moment  \nto reflect and look at the limitations of your \ndata and what further analysis might be conducted  \nrounding off step four we're going to move \non to the next step what skills you need  \nto actually become a data analyst in addition to \nthe role description and the processes that we've  \ndescribed so far data analysts are also expected \nto demonstrate certain skills and abilities  \nhere are some of the most important hard and soft \nskills that you'll need to become a data analyst  \nyou'll need to have some mathematical and \nstatistical ability data analysts spend a lot  \nof their time crunching numbers so you'll need to \nhave a mathematical brain you'll have to have some  \nworking knowledge of programming languages such \nas python oracle and sql data analysts rely on  \na number of programming languages to carry out \ntheir work this may seem daunting at first but  \nit's nothing that can't be learned over time with \npractice you'll also need an analytical mindset  \nit's not just about crunching the numbers and \nsharing your data sometimes you'll need to dig  \ndeeper to understand really what's going on \nit's all in the name an analytical mindset is  \na must remember data analytics is about answering \nquestions and solving business challenges and that  \nrequires some keen problem-solving skills data \nanalysts have a wide variety of tools at their  \ndisposal and you'll need to know which one to use \nand when you'll also need excellent communication  \nskills once you've harvested your data for \nvaluable insights it's important to share your  \nfindings so that it benefits the business data \nanalysts work in close collaboration with key  \nbusiness stakeholders and they may be responsible \nfor sharing their insights to those stakeholders  \nbut also the entire company so if you're thinking \nabout becoming a data analyst you need to be  \ncomfortable with this aspect of the job so that \nsummarises some of the key hard and soft skills  \nyou'll require as a data analyst i hope this \nhas been a value obviously this isn't a broad  \noverview of the field at hand if you've enjoyed \nthis video we've
