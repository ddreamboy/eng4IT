  "text": "if you use microsoft excel to analyze\ndata at work\nyou use piv tables and charts and things\nlike that but you\nneed more power you are interested in\nanswering\nmore complicated more impactful business\nquestions with data then this is the\nvideo for you\nin this video i'm going to go through my\ntop four data mining techniques using\nmicrosoft excel and what's so awesome\nabout data mining with excel is that any\nprofessional can do it\nand i mean any professional i don't care\nif you work in hr\nor finance marketing supply chain i.t\nproduct management\nwhatever these techniques are useful for\nany professional that wants to have more\nimpact at work with data analytics\nso what i will do is i will go through\nmy top four techniques for data mining\nwith excel in this video\njust so you know i have tutorials\nin-depth tutorials for all four of these\ntechniques on my channel\nso i'm not going to go into too much\ndetail in this video but what i will do\nis reference the appropriate video that\ni have on my channel at that particular\npoint in time just in case you're\ninterested\nin diving deeper and learning more about\nthe techniques\nso let's go ahead and get started with\nnumber one on the list and that is\nexploratory data analysis so here i am\nin excel and i want to show you what i\nmean when i talk about exploratory data\nanalysis\ntypically what this means is grabbing a\ndata set\nand formulating some sort of very\ninteresting or potentially\nimpactful business question and to\nreally exemplify this what i've got here\nis a famous data set this happens to be\na machine learning data set by the way\njust so you know\naround titanic passengers and the\nquestion\nthe relevant and impactful business\nquestion with this data is hey\nare there any patterns in the data that\nare highly associated or highly\npredictive\nof survival even though this is a\ntitanic machine learning data set\ndon't think of it that way just think of\nit as a proxy for customer data\nand let's say the example question you\nhave is hey is a customer going to\nconvert to paying\nis a customer going to buy more is a\ncustomer going to churn and leave us for\na competitor\nthese are the types of awesome questions\nthat you can answer using excel\nand exploratory data analysis techniques\nand i'm just going to briefly show you\nsome examples of what i'm talking about\nso i've got the data here and\nthe business question that we're trying\nto answer is hey what\ntypes of patterns in the data are highly\npredictive\nhighly associated with survival one of\nthe first things that you can do\nis create what's known as a histogram\nwhich is a particular kind of data\nvisualization and you can see an out of\nthe box\nhistogram right here and these are\nuseful but what's even better\nis when you actually use a pivot chart\nas a histogram and what you get is a\nmuch much more powerful data\nvisualization to help you answer\nquestions now\ncheck this out so you can see here i've\ngot the ages of the passengers on the\ntitanic\nand the colored bars here in the\nhistogram tell you the orange\nor the survival rates and the blue are\nfor the folks unfortunately that didn't\nmake it\nbut here's the thing check it out you\ncan use these slicers and you can say\nlook i'm interested in only\nfemales or males and only males let's\nsay females in\nfirst class i mean look at that look how\nit just changes and it shows you that\nwow\nfemales and first class overwhelmingly\nsurvive\nthis is the kind of exploratory data\nanalysis that isn't commonly\ndone by most excel users but is totally\neasy to do in excel\nand super super powerful but there's\nmore so for example there's another type\nof data visualization\nknown as a box plot what this shows you\nessentially is is what is the range of\nage values in the data set\nbased on whether someone didn't make it\nthey perished or they survived\npowerful stuff right because what you\ncan see here is\nokay generally speaking those that\nsurvived they kind of skewed to be\nyounger\nimagine that and then lastly and this is\njust one more example\nis a scatter plot which is you know just\nthese dots but notice what i've done\nhere\nis i've color coded these dots here\nto represent whether or not someone\nsurvived or perished and what you can\nsee is\nthe age on one axis in the family size\nhow many people\nwere traveling together on the titanic\nand what you can see here clearly\nis that it's kind of a mixed bag right\nit's like okay if your family size is\nbig and your\nage is young maybe you have a tendency\nto perish\nwhich might make some sense based on the\nnature of the data but all that to say\nexploratory data analysis is the\nfundamental thing if you want to uplevel\nyour data analytics game\nand in excel it is wildly easy and as i\nmentioned i have a whole\nseries of tutorials on exploratory data\nanalysis i'll put the playlist up here\nthis is number one on the list if you're\nonly going to do one thing out of the\nfour in this video\nthis is the thing to do exploratory data\nanalysis\nso after exploratory data analysis with\nexcel which is super awesome\nthe next thing on the list number two on\nthe list\nis market basket analysis and\nif you're not familiar market basket\nanalysis is a quintessential data\nanalysis technique\nused in the grocery store and retail\nindustries however\nit is super powerful you can do all\nkinds of things with it so let's pop\nover to excel and let me show you what i\nmean\nhere i am in excel and once again i'm\ngoing to be using\nthe titanic data set here as the frame\nof reference\nand that's only to cement this idea that\nyou can use market basket analysis\nin excel to mine all kinds of data and\ngenerate\nnew and powerful insights so once again\nin this particular case what we're\ninterested in\nis trying to find out what\ncharacteristics of individual\ntitanic passengers were highly\nassociated with survival\nand once again just think of this like\ncustomer data and the number of\nquestions you can\nanswer with market basket analysis is\nimmense\ni'm going to go ahead and ignore most of\nthis because\ni have a tutorial on my channel which i\nwill put\nright up here for you to take a look at\nand what you can see here is an example\nof market basket analysis\nin action and what i've asked excel to\ndo for me\nin this market basket analysis is to say\nlook it survived all right i want you to\nhold that steady i want you to find out\neverything else to the left of this\nparticular\ncell that is highly associated with the\nthing in the cell\nand survival in this case market basket\nanalysis is super powerful\nwhat you can see here is i'm only asking\nexcel to find the top two things that\nare highly associated with survival\nbut i don't have to only have two i\ncould have three or four or five this is\nwhere market basket analysis becomes\nreally really super powerful\nand what happens in this particular\nanalysis is that excel said okay dave\ni will find the top two things based on\nthe data that we saw\nin the table that are highly associated\nwith\nsurvival and they are being an adult\nfemale\nand what this tells me over here at this\npoint here\nthe lift this this is what this is\nwhat's so awesome about market basket\nanalysis\nwhat this tells me is based on the data\nthat i have\nthat if you're an adult female you are\n1.99\nbasically two times twice as likely to\nsurvive\nthis is the power of market basket\nanalysis in action\nand it doesn't have to be titanic\npassengers right it could be anything so\nfor example if you work in product\nmanagement\nyou could list the features in your\nsoftware application and say okay\nof all these different combinations of\nsoftware features which ones are most\nhighly associated with people\nnot only signing up for our software\nservice but also stick around and pay us\nmonth after month after month for a long\nperiod of time\nthere are scenarios in hr and\nmanufacturing\nin logistics you name it market basket\nanalysis is a\nwildly wildly useful tools so that's why\nit's number two on the list\nand not surprisingly once again i've got\na tutorial for this up here if you're\ninterested in learning more about market\nbasket analysis but this is the thing\nyou should tackle\nnext after exploratory data analysis\nafter market basket analysis number\nthree on the list the third thing that\nyou might find\nsuper super useful as a professional\nlooking to have more\nimpact at work with data is cluster\nanalysis\nand in particular the k-means algorithm\nfor cluster analysis\nis easily implemented in excel and is\nquite powerful\nand to kind of give you some sort of\nidea of what goes on with cluster\nanalysis let me flip over to powerpoint\nfor a quick intro this is a contrived\nexample to be sure\nbut it illustrates the idea of cluster\nanalysis\nthe idea is that you have a pile of data\nand what you want to do is you want to\nsay look\nare there any patterns in the data are\nthere any associations are there any\ngroupings in that data\nthat maybe i'm not aware of that might\nbe potentially useful\na quintessential example of using\ncluster analysis\nis what is known as customer\nsegmentation so for example you have a\nbig pile of customer data\nand what you want to do is group them\ninto groups and then take a look at\nthose groups and say\nwhat are the characteristics of this\ngroup that makes it different from this\ngroup and\nis this group more likely to buy or more\nlikely to do xyz\nthat sort of thing so cluster analysis\nis super useful but it goes way beyond\njust customer segmentation\nfor example in supply chain using\ncluster analysis\nin logistics is an awesome awesome\ntechnique\nso this is a contrived example and what\nyou can see here obviously\nare clusters right two obvious clusters\none right here\none right here but what's super\ninteresting in cluster analysis\nis actually situations like this this\ndata point right here\nand just just be clear this is a very\nvery contrived example because\nnotice that i'm only using two\ndimensions here an x-axis\nand a y-axis two dimensions but in a\nreal-world cluster analysis scenario\nyou might use four dimensions or five\ndimensions\nor seven dimensions and by the way just\nthink of a dimension as a column of data\nin an excel table the more columns that\nyou're using the more dimensions you\nhave and then of course obviously it\ngets more and more complicated to find\nthese groupings effectively so we're\njust going to use two dimensions here\nbecause\nthat's basically all powerpoint can\nhandle\nso what's going to happen is that we\nwould run a k-means\nclustering algorithm on this data and\nobviously it's going to find this\ncluster in this cluster but the question\nis what's going to happen to that data\npoint right here\nwhat's gonna happen to the data point\nand if you run the k-means\nalgorithm you see here that it decides\nthat eventually it becomes\nan orange dot so it becomes part of this\ncluster right here which is colored\norange and you've got this one\ndown here just in case you're curious\nthis\nbig orange dot and this big green dot\nthey're cluster centers\ni go into detail in the video up here on\nk-means cluster analysis with excel to\nexplain what these mean in more detail\nfor our purposes right now we don't care\nwhat happens is that k-means\niterates through the data over and over\nand over again until it finds all the\ndata and assigns it to all the clusters\nthat you specify\nthis is a super super useful algorithm\nk-means is very easy to implement in\nexcel\nall you need is basic functions tables\nof data and just a little bit of power\nquery\nand like i said i've got a video up here\nthis tutorial goes into how you can do\nthis\nin depth cluster analysis is a wildly\nuseful skill to have and which is why\nit's number three\non the list k-means clustering wildly\nuseful that's why it's number three on\nthe list\nthe last and final technique number four\non the list is naive bayes\nclassification now if you're not\nfamiliar with classification\njust think of it as a way of analyzing\nyour data\nto create a predictive model that allows\nyou to decide\nwhether something's good or bad yes no\napprove\ndeny that sort of thing and in this\nparticular case what i'm going to show\nyou is\na naive base classifier that allows you\nto predict whether or not an sms\ntext message is ham a legitimate text\nmessage from one of your friends or\nfamily members\nor it's spam something bad\nright hey buy this or whatever it might\nbe so let's flip over to excel and let\nme show you a naive bayes classifier in\naction\nall right here i am in excel where i've\nimplemented a naive bayes classifier\nand as with all of these techniques\nhere's my tutorial video up\nhere in case you want to learn more\nabout naive bayes\nnow all we're going to look at is this\nparticular table of data right here\nwhich says okay i've taken my existing\ndata\ni've used excel to build a naive bayes\nclassifier to determine whether or not a\ntext message is ham or spam\nham being good spam being bad and what\nthis\ntable shows you is hey if a new text\nmessage comes in\nwith this particular words in it or if\nthis message came\nin with those particular words in it\nwhether or not it is ham or spam and\nwhat you can see here\nare the predictions based on the text\nmessages that came in so for example\ncall claim you get home that is based on\nthe data that we had to build this\nclassifier we are going to predict that\nthat's ham that that's legit\nhowever if we get a message like this\ntext call free claim mobile you can get\nlove home\nno the video the tutorial will go into\nmore detail this is a contrived example\nbut just just roll with me on this\nso if you got this particular text\nmessage based on the data that we had\nto build this classifier we would\npredict that that's actually a spam\nmessage\nand by the way just so you know this is\nthe same type of tools and techniques\nthat are used for email as well to\ndetermine whether or not you're giving\njunk or spam email\nand put it automatically in your junk\nspam folder\neven though a spam filter this is what\nthis is called by the way a spam filter\nis a classic use case for naive bayes\nclassifiers\nit can be anything it doesn't have to be\nthis it could be\nfor example uh is a customer going to\nchurn\nis a customer going to leave us for a\ncompetitor yes or no\nyou can use a naive bayes classifier to\npredict that sort of thing\nthis thing is wildly useful the number\nof business scenarios that boil down\nto a yes no approved deny\nlegitimate fraudulent kind of scenario\nit's immense\nand it's across everything hr hr it's a\ngreat example so in hr\nyou could say for example i want to\ncreate a naive bayes classifier\nthat predicts whether or not a good\nemployee\nis going to quit and go to work for one\nof our competitors which is kind of like\na custom return scenario if you think\nabout it\nthat's the kind of thing that you can do\nwith your data in excel\nwith this technique naive bayes is\nawesome that's why it's number four on\nthe list of cool data mining techniques\nthat are wildly useful\nfor any professional okay i'm going to\nput up a couple more of my videos right\nhere just in case you're interested in\nlearning more about what's\npossible in terms of more advanced\nanalytics with excel there you have it\nmy top four data mining techniques in\nexcel for any professional if you want\nto\nup level your data analysis game these\nare the things to focus on\ni hope you enjoyed the video i hope you\nfound this useful until next time\nplease stay healthy and i wish you very\nhappy day to sleuthing\n",
