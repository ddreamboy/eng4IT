  "text": "This is a 3.\nIt's sloppily written and rendered at an extremely low resolution of 28x28 pixels, \nbut your brain has no trouble recognizing it as a 3.\nAnd I want you to take a moment to appreciate how \ncrazy it is that brains can do this so effortlessly.\nI mean, this, this and this are also recognizable as 3s, \neven though the specific values of each pixel is very different from one \nimage to the next.\nThe particular light-sensitive cells in your eye that are firing when \nyou see this 3 are very different from the ones firing when you see this 3.\nBut something in that crazy-smart visual cortex of yours resolves these as representing \nthe same idea, while at the same time recognizing other images as their own distinct \nideas.\nBut if I told you, hey, sit down and write for me a program that takes in a grid of \n28x28 pixels like this and outputs a single number between 0 and 10, \ntelling you what it thinks the digit is, well the task goes from comically trivial to \ndauntingly difficult.\nUnless you've been living under a rock, I think I hardly need to motivate the relevance \nand importance of machine learning and neural networks to the present and to the future.\nBut what I want to do here is show you what a neural network actually is, \nassuming no background, and to help visualize what it's doing, \nnot as a buzzword but as a piece of math.\nMy hope is that you come away feeling like the structure itself is motivated, \nand to feel like you know what it means when you read, \nor you hear about a neural network quote-unquote learning.\nThis video is just going to be devoted to the structure component of that, \nand the following one is going to tackle learning.\nWhat we're going to do is put together a neural \nnetwork that can learn to recognize handwritten digits.\nThis is a somewhat classic example for introducing the topic, \nand I'm happy to stick with the status quo here, \nbecause at the end of the two videos I want to point you to a couple good \nresources where you can learn more, and where you can download the code that \ndoes this and play with it on your own computer.\nThere are many many variants of neural networks, \nand in recent years there's been sort of a boom in research towards these variants, \nbut in these two introductory videos you and I are just going to look at the simplest \nplain vanilla form with no added frills.\nThis is kind of a necessary prerequisite for understanding any of the more powerful \nmodern variants, and trust me it still has plenty of complexity for us to wrap our minds \naround.\nBut even in this simplest form it can learn to recognize handwritten digits, \nwhich is a pretty cool thing for a computer to be able to do.\nAnd at the same time you'll see how it does fall \nshort of a couple hopes that we might have for it.\nAs the name suggests neural networks are inspired by the brain, but let's break that down.\nWhat are the neurons, and in what sense are they linked together?\nRight now when I say neuron all I want you to think about is a thing that holds a number, \nspecifically a number between 0 and 1.\nIt's really not more than that.\nFor example the network starts with a bunch of neurons corresponding to \neach of the 28x28 pixels of the input image, which is 784 neurons in total.\nEach one of these holds a number that represents the grayscale value of the \ncorresponding pixel, ranging from 0 for black pixels up to 1 for white pixels.\nThis number inside the neuron is called its activation, \nand the image you might have in mind here is that each neuron is lit up when its \nactivation is a high number.\nSo all of these 784 neurons make up the first layer of our network.\nNow jumping over to the last layer, this has 10 neurons, \neach representing one of the digits.\nThe activation in these neurons, again some number that's between 0 and 1, \nrepresents how much the system thinks that a given image corresponds with a given digit.\nThere's also a couple layers in between called the hidden layers, \nwhich for the time being should just be a giant question mark for \nhow on earth this process of recognizing digits is going to be handled.\nIn this network I chose two hidden layers, each one with 16 neurons, \nand admittedly that's kind of an arbitrary choice.\nTo be honest I chose two layers based on how I want to motivate the structure \nin just a moment, and 16, well that was just a nice number to fit on the screen.\nIn practice there is a lot of room for experiment with a specific structure here.\nThe way the network operates, activations in one \nlayer determine the activations of the next layer.\nAnd of course the heart of the network as an information processing mechanism comes down \nto exactly how those activations from one layer bring about activations in the next layer.\nIt's meant to be loosely analogous to how in biological networks of neurons, \nsome groups of neurons firing cause certain others to fire.\nNow the network I'm showing here has already been trained to recognize digits, \nand let me show you what I mean by that.\nIt means if you feed in an image, lighting up all 784 neurons of the input layer \naccording to the brightness of each pixel in the image, \nthat pattern of activations causes some very specific pattern in the next layer \nwhich causes some pattern in the one after it, \nwhich finally gives some pattern in the output layer.\nAnd the brightest neuron of that output layer is the network's choice, \nso to speak, for what digit this image represents.\nAnd before jumping into the math for how one layer influences the next, \nor how training works, let's just talk about why it's even reasonable \nto expect a layered structure like this to behave intelligently.\nWhat are we expecting here?\nWhat is the best hope for what those middle layers might be doing?\nWell, when you or I recognize digits, we piece together various components.\nA 9 has a loop up top and a line on the right.\nAn 8 also has a loop up top, but it's paired with another loop down low.\nA 4 basically breaks down into three specific lines, and things like that.\nNow in a perfect world, we might hope that each neuron in the second \nto last layer corresponds with one of these subcomponents, \nthat anytime you feed in an image with, say, a loop up top, \nlike a 9 or an 8, there's some specific neuron whose activation is going to be close to 1.\nAnd I don't mean this specific loop of pixels, \nthe hope would be that any generally loopy pattern towards the top sets off this neuron.\nThat way, going from the third layer to the last one just requires \nlearning which combination of subcomponents corresponds to which digits.\nOf course, that just kicks the problem down the road, \nbecause how would you recognize these subcomponents, \nor even learn what the right subcomponents should be?\nAnd I still haven't even talked about how one layer influences the next, \nbut run with me on this one for a moment.\nRecognizing a loop can also break down into subproblems.\nOne reasonable way to do this would be to first \nrecognize the various little edges that make it up.\nSimilarly, a long line, like the kind you might see in the digits 1 or 4 or 7, \nis really just a long edge, or maybe you think of it as a certain pattern of several \nsmaller edges.\nSo maybe our hope is that each neuron in the second layer of \nthe network corresponds with the various relevant little edges.\nMaybe when an image like this one comes in, it lights up all of the \nneurons associated with around 8 to 10 specific little edges, \nwhich in turn lights up the neurons associated with the upper loop \nand a long vertical line, and those light up the neuron associated with a 9.\nWhether or not this is what our final network actually does is another question, \none that I'll come back to once we see how to train the network, \nbut this is a hope that we might have, a sort of goal with the layered structure \nlike this.\nMoreover, you can imagine how being able to detect edges and patterns \nlike this would be really useful for other image recognition tasks.\nAnd even beyond image recognition, there are all sorts of intelligent \nthings you might want to do that break down into layers of abstraction.\nParsing speech, for example, involves taking raw audio and picking out distinct sounds, \nwhich combine to make certain syllables, which combine to form words, \nwhich combine to make up phrases and more abstract thoughts, etc.\nBut getting back to how any of this actually works, \npicture yourself right now designing how exactly the activations in one layer might \ndetermine the activations in the next.\nThe goal is to have some mechanism that could conceivably combine pixels into edges, \nor edges into patterns, or patterns into digits.\nAnd to zoom in on one very specific example, let's say the \nhope is for one particular neuron in the second layer to pick \nup on whether or not the image has an edge in this region here.\nThe question at hand is what parameters should the network have?\nWhat dials and knobs should you be able to tweak so that it's expressive \nenough to potentially capture this pattern, or any other pixel pattern, \nor the pattern that several edges can make a loop, and other such things?\nWell, what we'll do is assign a weight to each one of the \nconnections between our neuron and the neurons from the first layer.\nThese weights are just numbers.\nThen take all of those activations from the first layer \nand compute their weighted sum according to these weights.\nI find it helpful to think of these weights as being organized into a \nlittle grid of their own, and I'm going to use green pixels to indicate positive weights, \nand red pixels to indicate negative weights, where the brightness of \nthat pixel is some loose depiction of the weight's value.\nNow if we made the weights associated with almost all of the pixels zero \nexcept for some positive weights in this region that we care about, \nthen taking the weighted sum of all the pixel values really just amounts \nto adding up the values of the pixel just in the region that we care about.\nAnd if you really wanted to pick up on whether there's an edge here, \nwhat you might do is have some negative weights associated with the surrounding pixels.\nThen the sum is largest when those middle pixels \nare bright but the surrounding pixels are darker.\nWhen you compute a weighted sum like this, you might come out with any number, \nbut for this network what we want is for activations to be some value between 0 and 1.\nSo a common thing to do is to pump this weighted sum into some function \nthat squishes the real number line into the range between 0 and 1.\nAnd a common function that does this is called the sigmoid function, \nalso known as a logistic curve.\nBasically very negative inputs end up close to 0, \npositive inputs end up close to 1, and it just steadily increases around the input 0.\nSo the activation of the neuron here is basically a \nmeasure of how positive the relevant weighted sum is.\nBut maybe it's not that you want the neuron to \nlight up when the weighted sum is bigger than 0.\nMaybe you only want it to be active when the sum is bigger than say 10.\nThat is, you want some bias for it to be inactive.\nWhat we'll do then is just add in some other number like negative 10 to this \nweighted sum before plugging it through the sigmoid squishification function.\nThat additional number is called the bias.\nSo the weights tell you what pixel pattern this neuron in the second \nlayer is picking up on, and the bias tells you how high the weighted \nsum needs to be before the neuron starts getting meaningfully active.\nAnd that is just one neuron.\nEvery other neuron in this layer is going to be connected to \nall 784 pixel neurons from the first layer, and each one of \nthose 784 connections has its own weight associated with it.\nAlso, each one has some bias, some other number that you add \non to the weighted sum before squishing it with the sigmoid.\nAnd that's a lot to think about!\nWith this hidden layer of 16 neurons, that's a total of 784 times 16 weights, \nalong with 16 biases.\nAnd all of that is just the connections from the first layer to the second.\nThe connections between the other layers also have \na bunch of weights and biases associated with them.\nAll said and done, this network has almost exactly 13,000 total weights and biases.\n13,000 knobs and dials that can be tweaked and \nturned to make this network behave in different ways.\nSo when we talk about learning, what that's referring to is \ngetting the computer to find a valid setting for all of these \nmany many numbers so that it'll actually solve the problem at hand.\nOne thought experiment that is at once fun and kind of horrifying is to imagine sitting \ndown and setting all of these weights and biases by hand, \npurposefully tweaking the numbers so that the second layer picks up on edges, \nthe third layer picks up on patterns, etc.\nI personally find this satisfying rather than just treating the network as a total \nblack box, because when the network doesn't perform the way you anticipate, \nif you've built up a little bit of a relationship with what those weights and biases \nactually mean, you have a starting place for experimenting with how to change the \nstructure to improve.\nOr when the network does work but not for the reasons you might expect, \ndigging into what the weights and biases are doing is a good way to challenge \nyour assumptions and really expose the full space of possible solutions.\nBy the way, the actual function here is a little cumbersome to write down, \ndon't you think?\nSo let me show you a more notationally compact way that these connections are represented.\nThis is how you'd see it if you choose to read up more about neural networks.\n214\n00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:40,520\nOrganize all of the activations from one layer into a column as a vector.\nThen organize all of the weights as a matrix, where each row of that matrix corresponds \nto the connections between one layer and a particular neuron in the next layer.\nWhat that means is that taking the weighted sum of the activations in \nthe first layer according to these weights corresponds to one of the \nterms in the matrix vector product of everything we have on the left here.\nBy the way, so much of machine learning just comes down to having a \ngood grasp of linear algebra, so for any of you who want a nice visual \nunderstanding for matrices and what matrix vector multiplication means, \ntake a look at the series I did on linear algebra, especially chapter 3.\nBack to our expression, instead of talking about adding the bias to each one of \nthese values independently, we represent it by organizing all those biases into a vector, \nand adding the entire vector to the previous matrix vector product.\nThen as a final step, I'll wrap a sigmoid around the outside here, \nand what that's supposed to represent is that you're going to apply the \nsigmoid function to each specific component of the resulting vector inside.\nSo once you write down this weight matrix and these vectors as their own symbols, \nyou can communicate the full transition of activations from one layer to the next in an \nextremely tight and neat little expression, and this makes the relevant code both a lot \nsimpler and a lot faster, since many libraries optimize the heck out of matrix \nmultiplication.\nRemember how earlier I said these neurons are simply things that hold numbers?\nWell of course the specific numbers that they hold depends on the image you feed in, \nso it's actually more accurate to think of each neuron as a function, \none that takes in the outputs of all the neurons in the previous layer and spits out a \nnumber between 0 and 1.\nReally the entire network is just a function, one that takes in \n784 numbers as an input and spits out 10 numbers as an output.\nIt's an absurdly complicated function, one that involves 13,000 parameters \nin the forms of these weights and biases that pick up on certain patterns, \nand which involves iterating many matrix vector products and the sigmoid \nsquishification function, but it's just a function nonetheless.\nAnd in a way it's kind of reassuring that it looks complicated.\nI mean if it were any simpler, what hope would we have \nthat it could take on the challenge of recognizing digits?\nAnd how does it take on that challenge?\nHow does this network learn the appropriate weights and biases just by looking at data?\nWell that's what I'll show in the next video, and I'll also dig a little \nmore into what this particular network we're seeing is really doing.\nNow is the point I suppose I should say subscribe to stay notified \nabout when that video or any new videos come out, \nbut realistically most of you don't actually receive notifications from YouTube, do you?\nMaybe more honestly I should say subscribe so that the neural networks \nthat underlie YouTube's recommendation algorithm are primed to believe \nthat you want to see content from this channel get recommended to you.\nAnyway, stay posted for more.\nThank you very much to everyone supporting these videos on Patreon.\nI've been a little slow to progress in the probability series this summer, \nbut I'm jumping back into it after this project, \nso patrons you can look out for updates there.\nTo close things off here I have with me Lisha Li who did her PhD work on the \ntheoretical side of deep learning and who currently works at a venture capital \nfirm called Amplify Partners who kindly provided some of the funding for this video.\nSo Lisha one thing I think we should quickly bring up is this sigmoid function.\nAs I understand it early networks use this to squish the relevant weighted \nsum into that interval between zero and one, you know kind of motivated \nby this biological analogy of neurons either being inactive or active.\nExactly.\nBut relatively few modern networks actually use sigmoid anymore.\nYeah.\nIt's kind of old school right?\nYeah or rather ReLU seems to be much easier to train.\nAnd ReLU, ReLU stands for rectified linear unit?\nYes it's this kind of function where you're just taking a max of zero \nand a where a is given by what you were explaining in the video and \nwhat this was sort of motivated from I think was a partially by a \nbiological analogy with how neurons would either be activated or not.\nAnd so if it passes a certain threshold it would be the identity function but if it did \nnot then it would just not be activated so it'd be zero so it's kind of a simplification.\nUsing sigmoids didn't help training or it was very difficult \nto train at some point and people just tried ReLU and it happened \nto work very well for these incredibly deep neural networks.\nAll right thank you Lisha.\n",
