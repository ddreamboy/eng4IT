  "text": "you might find this hard to believe but\namazon.com's retail business isn't very\nprofitable selling consumers cheap\nChinese junk is a highly competitive low\nmargin business however Amazon Inc\nbecomes profitable after you factor in\nAmazon web services an insane Cash Cow\nthat recently hit operating margins of\n30% renting out servers AKA cloud\ncomputing is one of the best business\nmodels of the 21st century and nearly\nevery Indie hacker startup and\nEnterprise is highly addicted to it what\nthey don't tell you is that getting you\naddicted is essential for the business\nmodel to work today you learn exactly\nhow Cloud providers lock you in what you\ncan do about it and some new\ndevelopments that may change things in\nthe future it is February 12th 2024 and\nyou're watching the code report Amazon\nweb services was the original innovator\nof the cloud when it launched S3 and ec2\nback in 2006 AWS still dominates the\nmarket share today with Microsoft's\nAzure in second and Google Cloud\nplatform in third now even if you use a\nboutique platform like verell or netfi\nyou're still actually just using a big\ncloud provider because they generally\nresell AWS services at a higher price in\nexchange for a fancy UI and better\ndeveloper experience what's crazy though\nis that these companies have the means\nto stand up their own servers but\nthey're just as locked into AWS as we\nare and you'll find out why in just a\nminute now the first step to getting\nsomeone addicted to something is to\nstart them when they're young this is\nwhat Facebook does with social media and\nit's why smokers almost always start\nbefore they're 18 on the cloud they get\nthe addiction started with the free tier\nany new account that signs up gets a few\nhundred bucks for free but if you're a\nstart up and have the right VC behind\nyou you can easily get $100,000 in free\nAWS credits it's an awesome deal for a\nbut Amazon is playing the long game if\nyour startup doesn't fail they're going\nto make a 100 times that amount off you\nin the future in addition Cloud pricing\nmodels are extremely complex by Design\nthe more opaque the pricing model the\nharder it is to determine the actual\ncost implications of switching providers\nand for Enterprise they offer long-term\ndiscounts in additional support which\ncan be worth billions of dollars when\nyou have customers like the Pentagon\ngetting you in the door is pretty\nobvious but once you're in they also\nneed ways to make it hard for you to\nleave and one way they do that is by\ncharging outrageous egress fees egress\nis when data leaves the network as\nopposed to to Ingress when data comes\ninto the cloud which is generally free\nthat means if you use a cloud storage\nbucket and upload say a few pedabytes\nworth of data then decide you want to go\nto a different Cloud you're going to\nhave a massive Bill to move that data\nfrom one Cloud to the other people\ngenerally switch clouds to save money\nbut when you factor in that data\ntransfer bill it's usually not worth it\nlike when 37 signals migrated away from\nthe cloud they were looking at A3 to\n$400,000 S3 bill just to move the data\nthere is some good news though just a\nfew days ago Google Cloud removed\ntransfer fees when migrating away from\nGoogle Cloud that's great news for\ndevelopers because it breaks down the\nbarriers of vendor lockin however some\npeople saw this as a sign that Google\nCloud will be killed soon in which case\nI would lose this highly unfortunate bed\nI made last year that's why I think this\nis actually a sign of product strength\nand will hopefully motivate other clouds\nto do the same and by the way there's a\n0% chance Google Cloud shuts down\nanytime soon as it just hit\nprofitability in 2023 according to\nGemini this move might be related to the\neu's data act which is looking to crack\ndown on cloud egress fees take a look at\nthis breakdown on get deploying\nplatforms like cloudflare totally free\nwhile bare metal providers like lenoe\nand hetner are very reasonable but as we\nget up to AWS and Azure we see the free\nallowance decrease and the egress fees\nincrease but then it gets even worse\nwhen we look at platforms like forell\nand NFI they're basically pricing their\nbandwidth at five times what AWS charges\nthem pretty clever but why don't they\njust buy their own servers to reduce\nthese costs even further well as you can\nsee their infrastructure is highly\ndependent on AWS and their egress fees\nwould be astronomical and another thing\nis that many database companies like say\nmongodb give you the option to choose a\ncloud when you create an account well if\nyou're a customer with a massive data\nset it's going to be extremely expensive\nto use this service if it's not on the\nsame cloud and essentially that forces\nevery Big Data SAS company into the\ncloud and that's why Jeff Bezos has a\n$500 million yacht with a figure head of\nhis girlfriend on the bow and you don't\nbut data transfer fees are just one\nsmall way to get locked in another big\nissue is proprietary technology all the\nbig clouds have their own custom\ndatabases which are closed source and\nnot easy to migrate to other platforms\neven if you use an open source database\nlike postgress or MySQL you'll likely\nuse a fully managed service like RDS in\nwhich case you're reliant on the cloud\nto scale the infrastructure and handle\nthings like security updates and the\nsurrounding ecosystem is tightly\nintegrated all the products work great\nwhen they're on the same Cloud but most\nthings aren't standardized to work\nproperly outside that cloud and\nsometimes that can even include open\nsource tools when you build your\ninfrastructure around custom apis and\nproprietary Tech it becomes harder and\nharder to just transfer things elsewhere\nbut nobody wants to be a slave to the\ncloud so what do we do about it well we\nhave three main options option one is to\nnot use the cloud at all instead you buy\nyour own server and get some static IP\naddresses and try to manage everything\nby yourself it'll be way more expensive\nUPF front way more labor intensive to\nmaintain it won't be as fault tolerant\nor secure but could pay off in the long\nrun this option doesn't make a lot of\nsense for Indie hackers but makes a lot\nof sense for medium-sized businesses\nlike base camp which claims it'll save\n$7 million over the next 5 years by\nmoving off of the cloud option two is to\nuse the cloud responsibly and by that I\nmean use open source technologies that\nare portable which will then allow you\nto use a multicloud strategy where you\npick and choose the best services from\neach of the major clouds or a hybrid\nstrategy where you use your own hardware\nfor some things and the cloud for others\nthen finally option three is to embrace\nthe addiction pick a cloud and take the\neasy way out with all their proprietary\nTech the cloud is not supposed to be\ncheaper what you're paying for is\nconvenience bare metal minus pain equals\nAWS AWS minus pain equals verell the\nreal question is how much pain are you\nwilling to tolerate this has been the\ncode report thanks for watching and I\nwill see you in the next one\n",
