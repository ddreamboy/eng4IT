  "text": "hey guys my name is vardan and on behalf\nof Eda I welcome you all to this webinar\non data warehousing and business\nintelligence I'll be your instructor for\ntoday and I will be teaching you why any\ncompany needs to do business\nintelligence and thus thereby do data\nwarehousing so without wasting much time\nlet me show you the agenda for today so\nthese will be the topics that I will be\ncovering in today's session and this\nwill be the order in which I'll be\ncovering them okay the first topic that\nI'll be talking about is what is the\nneed for business intelligence and after\nthat I will talk talk about the need for\ndata warehousing so business\nintelligence is one of the most\nimportant aspects for any company to\ngrow well and to do good right and data\nbrowsing is among the most important\nactivities of business intelligence so\nthat's why these two things are interl\nand that's the connection these two have\nso you can think of data overing to be a\nkind of a subset of business\nintelligence so I will talk about these\ntwo things and after that I will talk\nabout the key terminologies that are\nrelated to data warehousing architecture\nright and some of the key terminologies\nare those of olp and olap the\ndifferences between the two okay the olp\nis somewhat very similar to the\ndatabases and olap is what represents\ndata wehousing so when you understand\nthe difference between the two you will\nalso understand the difference between a\ndatabase and a data warehouse you will\nalso understand why a data warehouse\nsuits business intelligence more than\ndatab base so that's about these two\ntopics and then we'll talk about ETL so\nETL stands for extract transform and\nload eil is a strategy to convert your\ndata from your database onto your data\nwarehouse right so moving the data from\nfrom one place to another that's all\ndone by ETL so we'll talk about ETL and\ndetail all right and after that I'll\ntalk about what a data Mar is and then\nwhat's at metadata now these two things\nare two topics which I can only explain\nonce I have given you an introduction to\nthe other topics all right so any of\nyour any doubts that you have during the\nsession you can ask me at that time and\nI'll clear them right away and once I'm\ndone teaching about all these four\ndifferent topics that related to data\nwarehousing architecture I will show you\nthe complete architecture and the\ncomplete life cycle of data and what\nkind of insights your company can get\nand what kind of advantages you can get\nout of data warehousing right so data\nwarehousing architecture will be the\nlast Topic in my presentation and after\nmy presentation I will show you a\ndemonstration of creating a data\nwarehouse where I will import data from\na database and store it in a data\nwarehouse right so this will be the\ntopics of today's session I hope the\nagenda is clear to everyone if you all\nagree with me please acknowledge that\nand also do acknowledge the fact if you\ncan hear my voice and see my screen so\nif everything is fine I can get started\nwith the session you can acknowledge and\nput any of your doubts or queries during\nthe session inside the chat box that you\nsee on your right side so I'm getting a\ncouple of acknowledgements from everyone\nall right so Rodney says yes rajes says\nyes all right guys and a couple more\npeople are also able to hear my voice\nand see my screen great so since the\nagenda is clear everyone let me get\nstarted with the first topic that is\nwhat is the need for business\nintelligence okay so we'll understand\nwhy business intelligence and data\nrousing are among the fundamental and\nthe foundation for any company's success\nso why do we have to to go for business\nintelligence right business intelligence\nis the activity which contributes to the\ngrowth of any company and there are also\nso many mnc's which have been\nestablished over the past few decades\nnow how did that happen they just didn't\nhappen by luck right so they were all\nsmall ideas they were small companies\nthat started with a small idea and then\nthey grow bigger so that's what any\ncompany that wants to do good that's\nwhat they do the first thing is they\nplan what they want to be and depending\non their plan then they start Gathering\ndata okay now once they gather data they\nknow they are in the right Direction now\nso they know what to do and how to do it\nand then they do further data analysis\non that they make up their plans and\nthey come up with strategies they come\nto know what is the important thing that\nneeds to be done and all these things so\nwhen they finally have a concrete plan\nthen they execute it into business\naction and once those actions are taken\nthen they're all good right that's when\nthe business starts to grow that's when\nthe company gets back all their\ninvestment and that's how actually any\ncompany grows so any company that has\ndone well over the past few decades be\nit Microsoft or Google or Facebook or\nAmazon Salesforce all of these companies\nthat have all grown from small ideas and\nthey've become something big right and\nany startup that's also trying to do\ngreat nowadays even they have to adopt\nthe same strategy and the same plan this\nis a very common thing and this is\nsomething that everyone knows okay but\nthis is not what I've uh you know come\nto teach all in this section what I've\ncome to teach all is something about\ndata warehousing and that is one of the\nmost important strategies or activities\nwhich is part of business intelligence\nright so before I talk about uh data\nbrowsing let me go into details of a\nbusiness intelligence so what exactly is\nbusiness intelligence bi is the act of\ntransforming raw or operational data\ninto useful information for business\nanalysis right so bi here stands for\nbusiness intelligence that's the short\nform and yeah it is the act of\ntransforming any raw or operational data\nso when we say raw operational data it's\nbasically the data that you've collected\nthe data that you have about your\nbusiness so it can be even if your\ncompany is starting from scratch then\nwhatever data you've gathered so you've\nkind of got to take that data and\nconvert that into useful information\nright so that you can plan and make\nstrategies and if you're a company\nthat's well established then you have to\nlook at your past results how your\ncompany has done over the past six\nmonths or the past the last quarter or\nthe last year or two and then make come\nup with proper plans for your future so\nwhen you do this then this entire Act is\ncalled as business intelligence and how\ndoes it work and this working of\nbusiness intelligence is with respect to\nthe it technology okay so bi which is\nbased on data warehouse technology okay\nthis is the key term that you got to\nremember the bi is based on data\nwarehouse technology extracts\ninformation from a company's operational\nsystems and the data that is extracted\nis first transformed and when we say\nit's transformed it's cleaned and\nintegrated and then it's loaded into\nData warehouses now the thing here is\nthere'll be data in many forms it can be\nin the form of flat files it can be in\nthe form of data bases if it's a Running\nCompany and if you're trying to do good\nokay if you've been the working for a\nnumber of years then you'll have data\nabout your past success about your sales\ndata your marketing data your\nexpenditure all these things you might\nhave stor it in any form maybe in the\nform of database maybe in the form of\nexcels flat files so all these things so\nthese make up your data source right so\nyou have this data over here and this\ndata is first transformed okay it's of\ncourse it's first extracted then inside\nthe data warehouse It's transformed\nwhich is cleaned and integrated okay so\nonce it's transformed then it's ready\nfor you to do your data visualization or\ndata analysis it's in a form in which\nyou can get insights and this is the\ndata which the end users will be using\nso you will have your data analyst in\nyour company right your data scientist\nyour data analyst and all the other\npeople your managers your and the other\nguys who call the big shots in your\ncompany so all these people they'll be\ngetting they'll be using this data to\nmake your analysis and that's the role\nof data warehouse it is sandwiched\nbetween these two end points and this\nserves as the basis or the springboard\nfor success and finally since the data\nis credible it is used for business\ninsights yeah this is again something\nthat I just spoke about right so now\nyou'll have a better understanding of\nhow business intelligence works right so\nyou all know that business intelligence\nis something important and uh how\nimportant and how good it is how does it\nwork is what I've explained in this\nslide so you all guys all agree with me\nhere anybody has any doubts Rodney rajes\nJacob okay pretty good all right nice\nokay so I have a question here from\nJacob Jacob is asking is Data Warehouse\nthe only thing that's needed okay Jacob\nthis is just an overview of uh business\nintelligence okay this a rough diagram\nand it's actually not just data\nwarehouse so data warehouse is something\nthat I'm concentrating on today's\nsession okay so that's why we have data\nwarehouse there's another important step\ncalled as data visualization so that\nvisualization is done by end users right\nsince it's done over here it's not\nmentioned this diagram but what you got\nto remember is data warehousing is\nprobably the springboard without data\nwarehousing the visualization cannot be\ndone and the data from the sources right\nfrom here it cannot be directly used for\nany other purpose so that's the role of\ndata warehousing so that's what a data\nwarehouse is and uh yeah are you clear\nJacob now okay great that's fine so U\nlet me go to the next slide then now\nthat you know what exactly is business\nintelligence let's let's go into details\nof data warehousing let's understand the\nchallenges in achieving business\nintelligence so first of all why should\nwe use a data warehouse because data\ncollected from various sources and\nstored in various databases cannot be\ndirectly visualized okay now look at\nthis image here in this diagram you have\ndifferent databases like Oracle you have\nthe sap base you have the Microsoft SQL\nserver and then you have other databases\nlike uh SQL database and all these\nthings okay you can also have flat files\nin this list so all these make up your\ndata sources you as a company can s data\neverywhere so if you're a small company\nyou might just deal with Microsoft Excel\nand you might just use small analysis\ntools okay but if you're a big company\nthat has a lot of data coming in so if\nyou're a retail company then you'll have\nto store details about your sales your\nmarketing and what's been your growth so\nfor all these purposes you need big\ndatabases right so all the data will be\nstored in all these databases okay now\nthe problem is some teams in your\ncompany might be using one database and\nthe other teams may be using another\ndatabase now the biggest problem that\npeople would find while they are doing\nvisualization or doing analysis is data\nis there in different databases and\nthey'll have a tough time integrating\nthem right now that's where data\nwarehouse comes in and that's where data\nwarehouse CES data warehouse it\nintegrates data from all these databases\nand then processes that data and brings\nit in a form that is very easy to do\nvisualization okay that's what the\nsecond Point says the data first needs\nto be integrated and then processed\nbefore visualization takes place now\nthis is the problem that you have with\nthe regular databases okay the data from\nhere they cannot be directly used for\nvisualization and since data warehouse\ncan do that since it can integrate data\nfrom multiple data warehouses and since\nthat data can be processed easily since\nit brings the data in a form which can\nbe easily visualized that's where dataow\nhas the advantage that's where it scores\nso that's the problem with database and\nthat's the advantage that data warehouse\nhas in fact data warehouse is more like\nan act it's a discipline which is\nfollowed by people okay these are\nactions which are adopted and strategies\nwhich are taken okay that's what data\nwarehous is and that is the role it\nplays in us doing very good\nvisualization all right so now this\nshould be a little more clear for you\npeople as to why data warehouse plays\nthe key role in the whole bi aspect\nright okay great let's go to the next\nslide then now let's understand in\ndetail what a data warehouse is now a\ndata warehouse is a central location\nwhere Consolidated data from multiple\nlocations okay or databases that's what\nlocations mean from multiple locations\nare stored now this means this is\nexactly what I explained earlier right\nso you have a data that's coming in from\nmultiple data sources you have all the\ndata you consolidate all the data into\none single place and the data warehouse\nis maintained separately from an\norganization operational database now DW\nhere stands for data warehouse all right\nso and here it says that data\nwarehousing is maintained separately\nfrom an organization's operational\ndatabase okay and uh yeah the DW stands\nfor data warehousing and the reason a\ndata warehouse is stored separately from\nthe operational database is because the\ndata should not get affected so you will\nhave your operational data on one end\nokay where all your legacy data will be\nstored where all your even probably your\nreal data will be stored so all your\ntransactions all your sales all your\nmarketing all your operations data all\nthese will be stored in one place and in\nduring the act of data warehousing where\nyou're doing that when you're making\nanalysis when when you're using that\ndata you don't want that to get\ncorrupted right so it's more like a\nbackup so for backup for purpose your\noperational data is separated so you\nhave your operational data you keep it\nin one area and then you create a new\ndatabase okay in fact it's called a data\nwarehouse okay so you get all the uh\ndata from multiple sources or maybe from\na single Source get it into a data w and\nfrom here you do your analytics so the\nprocess of getting the operational data\ninto your data warehouse that's called\nextraction transform and loading okay\nnow when you've done these three things\nyou form your data warehouse and from\nyour data warehouse you use the olap\nstrategy okay so olap stands for online\nanalytical processing so you use this\nolap strategy or well this analytics\nprocessing for the business users to do\nanalysis so it's there in the name right\nit stands for analytical processing so\nthe business users whatever analysis\nthey want to do they do it because there\nis uh the option of olap and then along\nwith the analysis they can also do\nvisualization for visualization you have\nvarious other tools like tab blue and\nclick view right there are some amazing\ntools so you can get this data you can\nget it into the data warehouse and the\ndata warehouse also it can be stored in\nsome kind of database it can store this\nuh data back into some kind of Oracle or\nSQL server or maybe even an Excel and\nwhen you've stored there then you can do\nyour olap activities there and also you\ncan import that data into your various\nvisualization tools like or click View\nand thus you can you know get insights\nyou can get insights into your data you\ncan deliver presentations uh during your\nboard meetings you can show your\nfindings to your superiors or your\nmanagers you can do all these things so\nthat's what a data warehouse is okay and\nthen the next point we have here is end\nusers access it whenever any information\nis needed yeah so this is again the same\nthing right so once the data comes in\nfrom the operational system it's stored\nin the data warehouse it stays there so\nthis data is not going to change so\nwhatever change you R your operational\ndata that can be done okay you can\nmodify this data you can update it you\ncan delete data here you can do all\nthese things but once your data comes\ninto your data warehouse it cannot be\ndeleted okay you can maybe modify things\nthe worst case scenario you can modify\ndata here okay but it's highly advisable\nnot to but of course you can so that's\nthe thing but yeah the key point you got\nto notice the end users can use it\nanytime they can probably access a data\nthat is 10 years old or 20 years old and\nall these things and uh how can they do\nit by using olap so they can do the\nanalysis and they can run it over\ndifferent times right so these are a\nseries of snapshots So based on you can\nfind data analysis like what happened at\nthis particular day on this particular\nYear all these things you can see what\nkind of product was sold how many\ncustomers bought which product all these\ndetails can be easily gathered and\naccessed from here so that's what we say\nwhen you know uh the data can be\naccessed at any time by the end users or\nthe business users so the business users\nhere are typically those of managers it\ncan be managers or people who are uh\nleading board meetings who are making a\nplan for the next quarter or the next uh\nhalf year or the next one year and all\nthese things so guys yeah that's that\nwas a question which Jacob asked guys so\nJacob asked who will be the end users\nwho will be the business users so that's\nwhat they are okay people who will be\nusing this data it can be even data\nanalysts or data scientists and all\nthose people right guys are you clear\nJacob okay great and there's a note okay\nthe data warehouse here it is not loaded\nevery time when new data is added to the\ndatabase so what this means is you have\ndata coming into your operational data\nokay this operational data will get\nupdated every minute probably every\nsecond if you have a 247 working sales\nteam then they'll be making sales around\nthe clock right so as in when any sale\nhappens the data will be added to your\ndata base to your operational data but\nthat not necessarily needs to be added\nto your data warehouse also so what you\nfind in your data warehouse is Legacy\ndata right it's historical data which\nyou can use to perform analysis or all\nthose find insights the operation data\nif you have new data coming in here this\nhas to be imported and this has to be\nmoved to your data warehouse first and\nthen once it's moved to your data\nwarehouse from here it can be used for\nanalysis and all these things by our end\nusers so that's what this uh diagram\nhere means and that's what the last\npoint also means okay data warehouse is\nnot loaded every time new data is added\nto this database okay so I hope it's all\nclear Rodney Rodney and Rajesh okay\ngreat so fine then if you guys have\nunderstood what data warehous is I can\ngo to my next slide and talk about the\nnext topic so that was about data\nwarehouse now let's look at the\nadvantages of a data warehouse when we\ncompare it to any database or just\nregular flat files and all these things\nthe first Advantage is that strategic\nquestions can be answered by starting\nTrends so this is the biggest benefit\nthat you can get right your data\nanalysts and data scientists they can\nanswer strategic questions they can read\nthe past data they can predict your\nfuture also by coming up with uh by\nhaving their strategic questions be\nanswered because strengths can be\nanalyzed using the data warehouse it's\nbasically the data that is stored in\nyour operational data also but it's just\nthat it's easier to study Trends on your\ndata warehouse rather than datab base\nokay because rajes here has a question\nguys rajes is asking why not a database\nwhat is it that a data warehouse can do\nthat a database cannot do so uh guys\nthat's what I was answering correct\nrajes remember the first thing is let me\ngo back to my previous slide for this\nokay so you have your operational data\nhere so you have all your data here\nwhich is probably Legacy which is even\nreal time all these things will be\npresent here but in your data where\nhouse you'll only have your legacy data\nyou'll only have historical data you\nwon't have realtime data here but that\ndoesn't mean it's not you know it's any\nlesser than operation data since you\nhave your data completely here you have\nthe freedom to do your analysis and you\nalso have your freedom to do your data\nvisualization okay so that's one\nadvantage and the other Advantage with\nthe data warehouse is that your data\nwill be coming in from m multiple\nsources right we'll have data coming in\nfrom multiple sources your tables will\nnot be related to each other even if\nit's from the same database you'll have\nmultiple tables for multiple teams right\nand you can't easily integrate all these\ntables because they'll be separated okay\nthat is one big problem that you will\nface when you're are doing the analysis\nor visualization but uh in a data\nwarehouse it will be stored such that\nall the data will be interlined right\nit'll be related by using schemas or all\nthese things so you have a different\nschemas like Star schema uh n schema\nGalaxy schema and all these things so\nyou have all these dimensions and facts\nall these Concepts using which you can\nrelate your tables you can relate your\ndata so all your rows and all your\ncolumns here which are unrelated which\nare stored in separate databases or in\nseparate flat files Separate Tables they\ncan all be integrated they can all be\nstored together so there'll be a\nrelation so every single row or every\nsingle table will be linked with each\nother and when you do an analysis like\nthat then you can probably pull data\nacross the uh database right so whatever\ndata stored across the various databases\nyou can put all that data and Link them\nall together by running one query and\nyou can get all those details in just uh\nby just running one single query using\nyour data warehouse so that is the\nadvantage uh rajes right so did you get\nit rajes this is the second Advantage\nokay that's why business users they they\nprefer to use data coming from data\nwarehouse so this is a more structured\nand this is a more related data when you\ncompare it with the operational data and\nthe basic data source all right fine\nfine fine very good very good I hope\nyou've you've cleared your doubts I hope\nthat's the same thing with even others\nright okay even more clear great great\nRodney is telling now I've got it even\nmore clear fine fine very nice that that\nwas a very good question good you asked\nme there and uhu yeah I'm glad you\nstopped me because I could explain it in\na better way so anyways moving on that\nwas about data warehouse and talking\nabout the advantages of data warehouse I\nspoke about the fact that you know you\ncan IC questions by studying all the\ntrends by studying your past data you\nyou will have all the graphs you can\nhave the uh pictorial representations\nright you can see what was whether the\ntrend is growing or not which product is\ngetting sold uh how better is getting\nsold all these things you can easily\nread by using a data warehouse because\ndata warehouse makes your data more\nreadable information so that's the thing\nso you guys must know the difference\nbetween data and information right so\ninformation is something that is\nprocessed processed data is called\ninformation so information is easier to\nunderstand easier to relate to and\neasier to use now that's what data\nwarehouse does it takes you one step\ncloser to information right so that's\nthe advantage and uh yeah the other\nthing is data bring is faster and it's\nmore accurate yes this is something\nthat's completely true because in your\ndatabase you'll have loads of data you\nof course you'll have historical data\nand realtime data but the thing is it's\nnot going to be as fast as data\nwarehouse data warehouse you will have\nlinks there you will have links you'll\nhave tables you'll have relations\nbetween the various tables and because\nof all these things you can easily\ngather and you can easily access data\nhere and the data that is gathered from\nhere it's also more accurate because\nthere won't be much change because\nthere's not going to be any question of\nreal time data coming in and changing\nthings around right so you made so\nwhatever uh you know processing or\nanalysis it's done based on the past\ndata that is stored in the data\nwarehouse and that makes this data more\naccurate it makes it more stable so\nstability is the key word here and and\nstability is not something that you can\nhave all the time in database but you\nwill have it with the data warehouse so\nthat's the second big advantage and in\nfact there are many more advantages\nright so data overh housing is something\nthat you guys will understand when you\nstart implementing so in the demo\nsession that I'll show you later today\nthat time you'll understand you know\nyou'll understand the other advantages\nwith data warehousing okay and one\nimportant point that you need to notice\nthat data warehouse is not a product\nthat a company can go and purchase okay\nit needs to be designed and uh it\ndepends entirely on the company's\nrequirement so like I said your database\nis something uh it's a necessity right\nyour database or where you're storing\nyour data your data source is something\nthat you have to have and then your data\nwarehouse is something that is designed\nand uh which completely depends on your\ncompany's requirement based on your data\nsource based on the requirements that\nyou want to get out of your data source\nout of the data that you have in your\ndata source you can come up with a way\nto design your data warehouse right so\ndata warehouse is more of a concept and\nit's a strategy and it's not an end\nproduct but it's not a tool or something\nthat you can use you have multiple tools\nto implement data warehousing and uh the\nthing you got to notice data warehousing\nis not a product okay so it's a strategy\nthat you adopt to make your data more\nreadable and uh make your data in a\nbetter fashion okay so that's the uh\nbiggest Advantage with data warehouse so\nlook at this guy here okay he'll just\nrun one query on the data warehouse okay\nnow what the data warehouse will do the\ndata is taken from the operational\nsystems all right and in fact if there\nare multiple operational systems then\nall those uh multiple data from multiple\noperational systems will be integrated\ntogether and then that will be\nstandardized and any inconsistencies\nthere in that data will be removed okay\nnow these are the three important things\nthe data is taken from the operational\nsystems and uh that data if there are\nmultiple operational systems those will\nbe integrated okay and then the data\nwill be standardized and any\ninconsistencies will be removed and uh\nonce all these three things are done\nthen it can be stored in an easy format\nwhich can be uh you know which is very\nsuitable for analysis and access and\nthat is what a data wouse is so whenever\nhe runs a query on this kind of a data\nwouse which is a process and which is\nready in such a fashion you can get the\nresult quickly and uh this result will\nalso be more accurate all right so this\nis the big Advantage with the data\nwarehouse so I hope this is clear it's a\npretty simple concept here and uh it's\njust an overview of what I explained in\nthe previous slides right right Jacob\nrajes Rodney all right okay so moving on\nthere are four important important\nproperties that a data warehouse has\nokay and uh these four properties are\nbased on what Bill inmon said bill inmon\nis the father of data warehousing and uh\ninitially he defined data warehouse as a\nsubject oriented integrated time variant\nand nonvolatile collection of data in\nsupport of the Management's decision-\nmaking process okay so when we say\nsubject oriented it means that the data\nwill be categorized and stored by the\nbusiness subject rather than by the\napplication now let me get back to this\npoint after I finish these three okay\nnow this is the most uh complicated\nPoint okay now talking about integration\nright he said that data is integrated so\nthe meaning here is data on a given\nsubject is collected from disparate\nsources and stored in a single place so\nthis is something you people know data\nis collected from multiple sources and\nthey all stored in one single place so\nyou don't have to uh you know go about\nsearching for data in different tables\nor different uh sources and all those\nthings and then your data it is time\nvariant it is stored as a series of\nsnapshots each representing a period of\nof time so when you do your analysis you\ncan do it based on a series of snapshots\nof time okay you can see what was your\ncompany status on this month uh that\nyear or on this month this year what is\nthe progress that's been made or if it's\nnot a progress if it's the same if your\ngrowth has been stagnated then you can\nfind out what are the metrics what are\nthe reasons why that has happened you\ncan find all these things and you can\nlook at all those details from a Time\napproach right from a Time variant\napproach so that's what a data warehouse\nthe advantage here is okay that's one of\nthe properties and the advantages that\nyou have and then data is nonvolatile\nthe data in a data warehouse is not\nupdated or deleted so this is what is\nthe other property that I mentioned\nearlier once a data comes into a data\nwarehouse it cannot be deleted or\nneither can it be changed in fact it can\nbe updated but the process of having to\nupdate it is a little complicated okay\nbut of course it can be updated and\ndeleted so that's the thing but it's\nhighly recommended not to update okay so\nthat's the advantage with the data\nwarehouse and since it will not be\nchanged there's no question of it\ngetting corrupted and that's why uh\ndoing analysis and all these things are\nyou know a better option now getting\nback to the first point we said that it\nis subject oriented right data is\ncategorized and stored by business\nsubject rather than by the application\nnow what this means is the data here\nwill be stored or uh the data that you\nwill that you retrieve from a data\nwarehouse right you will get it in the\nform that you wanted to now if you want\nto give me an example example of that\nlet's say that we are dealing with a\nretail company and in my retail company\nI have a marketing team I have a sales\nteam and I have a operations team and my\nsales team kind of keeps keeps track of\nall the sales that happens over a period\nof time okay let's say the last one\nmonth whatever sales they have done they\nhave stor all those details and then you\nhave your operations team which will\nmake sure there is a smooth running of\nall the process once the sale is done\nthere are various other activities\ninvolved right like shipping the product\nand uh you know all these things\nshipping and coordinating the uh\ntransferring activities and all these\nthings and then your marketing team is\nsomeone is uh probably that team which\nwould take care of your sales which\nwould ensure that uh the right leads\ncome in to ensure that the right uh\npeople get the right kind of service and\nit's all about acquiring more such sales\nright so your marketing team is on top\nof the funnel and they do all these\nthings now if you want to integrate all\nthese details if you want one single\nview of them and you want to find\nDetails such that in this particular\nmonth what was your sales and uh what\nwas the kind of operations that was done\nright what kind of service was given to\nthose customers and from how they became\nour customers so when we the question of\nhow they became is something related to\nmarketing so if you have a question like\nthis where three factors are involved\nthen at that point of time it's your\ndata aers which comes to the rescue\nbecause when your question is related to\nthis particular time and uh these three\ndifferent metrics sales marketing and\noperations then all these things can be\nintegrated and you can get one single\nview from your data warehouse this is\nwhat a datab base lacks correct so uh\nyou know get integrating all your\ndifferent data sources and you know\nstoring them together and making them\nready for Anytime access is the biggest\nadvantage and the most important\nproperty of a data warehouse so if you\nguys had any problem in the previous\nslides then I'm pretty sure this is\nsomething you have really understood\nafter this slide because um this is\nprobably the epor of data warehouse\nright these three properties if you\nunderstand these four properties\nthen you're pretty much ready to\nunderstand the next part the next uh\nyou're ready to go to the next step in\ndata warehousing right so by now you\nshould have understood how important all\nthis is why you know how important\nbusiness intelligence is and what kind\nof role this data warehouse plays you\ncan just think of how humongous deal\ndata warehouses correct yeah so couple\nof people are satisfied with that so uh\nnow that we've spoken about the\nproperties let's go to the next slide\nand okay now we have to talk about key\nterminologies okay so right now we've\nunderstood data warehousing from a\nhigher level okay now let's uh dig deep\nlet's go to more Basics here okay let's\nunderstand the key terminologies that\nare related and that are involved in a\ndata warehousing so first of all we have\nolp and olap okay now there are four\nthings which I will talk about the\ndifferences between olp and olap okay\nthen I'll talk about edl I'll talk about\ndata mat and then finally about metadata\nokay so let me go to the first topic\nthat is olp versus olab okay so in uh\nthis part which is olp olp stands for\nonline transaction processing okay now\nthis is something that uh is a\nrepresentation of that of a database if\nyou're running any kind of uh queries on\nyour database then that's called online\ntransaction processing okay and then\nolap stands for online analytical\nprocessing and this is the property of a\ndata warehouse so any kind of query or\nany kind of analysis that you run on\nyour data warehouse that called as an\nolap activity correct so let's go into\nthe differences between the two so first\nof all any data that is stored in a\nrelational database right in an which\ninvolves OLV that contains the current\ndata as well as past data okay current\ndata as well as past data but with\nrespect to data warehouse and uh while\nperforming an overlap you will be\ndealing with only historical data here\nokay it contains only historical data\nand the data that will be stored in your\ndatabase okay when you use the OTP then\nthose queries will be used ful in\nrunning your business okay when you have\nto run your business like if you want to\nstore the data of the number of sales\nthat has happened today like every time\na sales happens then your records in\nyour database has to be updated right so\nthat's what we say so when you update\nyour record with the latest details of\nyour customer then that is what is the\nmeaning of useful in running the\nbusiness okay but an olap is something\nthat is useful in analyzing the business\nso here the kind of activity that you\nwould do is that of finding out details\nlike at what time how many customer\ncustomers bought the products or at what\ntime which customer bought which all\nproducts all these kind of questions\nwill be answered with the help of olab\nokay and then the whole oldp model of\naccessing data of accessing or quering\ndata on a database it's based on the\nentity relationship model okay but\nwhereas with the data warehouse it's\nbased on the star schema or the\nsnowflake schema and the fact\nconstellation schema okay so it's called\nalso called as the Galaxy schema so all\nthese three things will come into\npicture okay and then your relational\ndatabase it provides A Primitive and a\nhighly detailed data so since you'll\nhave one database if you run one kind of\na query like a select star from this\nparticular table then it would give you\nall the details that is stored right so\nyou cannot filter too many details with\nrespect to the data that is stored in\nyour database okay of course you can but\nthe level of uh you know the filtering\nand Analysis that you can do is uh not\nthat much so the data that you will get\nback from your query right the result\nthat you'll get back from your query\nwill be highly detailed okay and it will\nnot be exactly what you want so it will\nnot be that accurate but whereas with\nthe olap when you do an oap on a data\nwarehouse it provides a summarize and\nthe Consolidated data it will point to\nyou exactly what you want to look for\ncorrect so it will uh it's a very\nprocessed data and it points to one\nparticular aspect which matters the most\nso that's what this is and then the oldp\nyou use this for writing data into the\ndatabase okay so like I said the same\nsales example whenever a new sales\nhappens your database has to be updated\nright with the new records of the\nproduct sold of the customer who bought\nthe product and all these things so you\nbasically use it for writing data into\nthe database but your data warehouse is\nprimarily used for reading data from the\ndata warehouse so writing to the data\nwarehouse is something that is done so\nthat you can do the reading from the\ndata warehouse okay the primary concept\nhere is to read the data from the data\nwarehouse and to do the analysis and all\nthe visualization activities but with\nthe database it's more of writing the\ndata into the database all right and uh\nthe size So speaking of the size a\ndatabases size would range anywhere\nbetween 100 MB to 1 GB okay and this is\nalso a very big number 100 MB is a very\nless number I would say and 1GB is also\nvery less so it would typically be much\nmore than this but compared to this uh\nrange if you look at a data warehouse a\ndata warehouse size ranges from 100 GB\nto 1 TB correct so your data wouse will\nhave all the historic data and it will\nhave all the relation ships between the\ndifferent datas right such that you can\ndo your analysis straight away so since\nit makes all the data more efficient and\nstuff the data here the size ranges from\n100 GB to almost 1 TB so that is what a\ndata warehouse is and that's the part of\na data warehouse all right and um I can\nactually show you the difference between\nthe two in today's demo session okay\nlater during the session I'll show you\nthat the size of the source file that I\nhave I will show you the different sizes\nof the two files that I'll be using as a\nsource and then after they are processed\nthe data that I'll store in my data\nwarehouse I'll show you what is the size\nof that data so there'll be a big\ndifference between the two okay and the\ndata warehouse will be more than the\ndatabase I will show you that aspect\nlater all right so and that's about this\npoint and then yeah of course this will\nbe fast okay database is fast and it\nprovides high performance all right so\nyour data V of course it's not as fast\nas your database but it's highly\nflexible it's highly flexible because it\ngives you different views so you have\nsomething called as the olap cube right\nso using the olap Cube you you can uh\nget the you can look at insights from\ndifferent angles different perspectives\nand different views of data you will get\nso that is the uh big Advantage here\nokay and the number of records that is\naccessed it is in tens but whereas with\nthe data warehouse the number of Records\naccessed is in millions all right an\nexample of this can be all the bank\ntransactions made by a particular\ncustomer so if there is one customer and\nwhatever transactions he's made he will\nget all those uh you know all those\ndetails right so supposing take the\nexample of any email statement that you\nrequest for any email statement or Banks\naccount statement all these things so\nthey are an example of OLV so whatever\ndetails are present in the database\nthose will be given to you but whereas\nthe bank transactions made by a customer\nat a particular time okay this is a more\nfiltered query and the answer also will\nbe very accurate and point you to\nexactly that particular question so\nthat's what an noap is so it's not going\nto give you an overview here it's going\nto exactly point you to what you want\nit's not very much in detail but it's\nmore accurate correct so that's what an\nolap is and that's the difference\nbetween olp and olap okay so these are\nthe two strategies that are used for you\nknow accessing data olp is used for\naccessing data in a database and olap is\nused for accessing that data in a data\nwarehouse all right so I hope even this\nSL is clear to everyone all right guys\nokay if you have any doubts then that\nwill be cleared by this uh slide okay\nbecause the examples are there for both\nthese strategies so if you want more\nexamples of an old TP then one would be\nthat of Supermarket server which records\nevery single product purchased at that\nmarket okay so every single product in\ntheir history or probably in the last\none month all these things can be\naccessed using your olp okay from your\ndatabase you don't have options to do\nmuch of filtering here and then another\nexample is that of a bank server which\nrecords every time a transaction is made\nfor a particular account okay every time\na transaction is made in a particular\naccount the data will be updated in that\ntable and uh you can query that kind of\ndata and you'll get that result okay\nanother example is that of a railway\nreservation server which records a\ntransaction of a passenger so whatever\nactivities at passenger does so all\nthese things will be recorded by the\nreservation server right so this is one\nexample but when you look at olap they\nwill be much more detailed the queries\nhere will be much more detailed and the\nanswers will be much more accurate and\nvery crisp okay so an example is that of\na bank manager wants to know how many\ncustomers are utilizing the ATM of his\nBranch okay because maybe based on that\nhe may take a call whether to continue\nthat ATM or relocate that ATM to a\ndifferent place right so this guy this\nbank manager would want to you know\nfirst of all understand if there's any\nuse in having the ATM in that place are\npeople using it correct if people are\nusing it then how many people are using\nit at what time are they using it or\nwould it be better to have the ATM in a\ndifferent location where it's much more\neasier for people to access it so all\nthese kind of questions will be answered\nonly if you have olap in place okay only\nwhen you have a data warehouse in place\nnot with the database so another example\nis that of an insurance company that\nwants to know the number of policies\neach agent has sold okay this will help\nan better Performance Management of\nAgents so you'll have multiple agents in\nyour company and you would want to know\ntheir performance right you know you\nYou' want to know who is the best\nperforming agent you would want to know\nhow they're performing why is this\nperson performing better you can you\nknow optimize each of their performances\nso all these things can be done with the\nhelp of a data warehouse and they can be\ndone with the help of olab right the\nolap strategy the olap activity that is\ndone on a data warehouse so that is the\ndifference between the two right so I\nhope you're getting the differences here\nguys right oldp and olap okay since it's\nall clear let me go to the next slide\nnow the uh second important terminology\nthat we have with data warehouse is that\nof ETL extract transform and load so by\ngoing by the definition ETL is a process\nof extracting the data from various\nsources transforming this data to meet\nyour requirements and then loading the\ndata into a Target data warehouse okay\nyou're extracting the data from here\nright you're extracting it and then\nyou're transforming it into the way you\nwant in a more readable fashion in a\nmore relatable fashion then once that is\ndone you load that data into a data\nwarehouse and the whole process of\ngetting the data from your data source\nto your data warehouse this is done by\nthe ETL the activities of extraction\nextraction transformation and loading so\nwe have popular tools for for this very\nprocess so you have tools like Talent uh\nInformatica you have uh irin all these\nthings and Informatica and talent are\nprobably the most popular tools for this\nprocess for extraction transformation\nand loading data into a data warehouse\nright so uh this is something that uh\nyou should have understood by now any\ndoubts guys because I don't want to\nwaste much time I want to go to the next\nslide and teach the next concept okay\ngreat so the next one is data Mt okay\nnow if you've understood so far ETL then\nhalf your job is done because data Mt is\nsomething that's very close to a data\nwarehouse and you don't have that much\nof difference when it compared to a data\nwarehouse but the basic difference\nbetween the two is the data Mart is uh\njust the same data warehouse itself but\na smaller version okay so let's look at\nthe line the definition here the data\nMart is a smaller version of the data\nwarehouse which deals with a single\nsubject okay the data marks are focused\non one area hence they draw the data\nfrom limited number of sources and the\ntime taken to build data marks is very\nless compared to the time taken to build\na data warehouse now to give you an\nexample or an explanation of this in\nyour data warehouse you will have all\nyour details right all your details that\nyou have so this itself is more refined\nokay but your data Mars are smaller\nversions of that data warehouse which is\nuh used to satisfy only certain users\nsupposing you have one particular user\nbase okay uh that is your sales team or\nyour sales manager who wants to use only\nyour sales data then that can be done\nwith the help of a data M and similarly\nyou have a marketing team who wants to\naccess all the marketing data then that\ncan be done by using a data M okay and\nthen again you have other operations\nteam that wants to do who wants to\naccess the operations data then you can\ngive them only access to that data by\nusing a data Mt separately okay now the\nneed for data Mart is first of all your\ndata warehouse will store all the data\nokay your sales data marketing data\noperations data so all the data coming\nfrom different data sources so you'll\nhave multiple data sources right all\nthat will be stored in one single place\nand from here this will again act like\nseparate data sources right so for the\nsales team this will act as a data\nsource for a marketing team this will\nact as a data source and then for the\noperations team this m will act as a\ndata source now the now answering the\nquestion as to why we need them it's to\nyou know probably give more security to\nenable more security and uh Integrity\nbecause since all your data will be\nthere in your data warehouse and if you\nlet all your uh your entire company\naccess the data warehouse they'll get\naccess to all the details and all the uh\nall the work that is done by other teams\nokay so there might be multiple teams\nand there'll be multiple strategies\nwhich you might not want to reveal to\nother teams so at that kind of a time\nyou can divide your data warehouse such\nthat only this particular uh users okay\nyour sales users or a particular user\nbase gets access to only certain data\nfrom your data warehouse so at that kind\nof a time a data Mt is useful or you can\nhave a second data M for only another\nset of user base for example your\nmarketing users so they will get access\nto only the marketing data from your\ndata warehouse\nright and then your operations data\nsimilarly which can be accessed only by\nyour operations folks so that's the uh\ndifferent advantages that you have since\nthe data is all divided it's all stored\nseparately different people have access\nto different uh different parts of your\ndata warehouse so this probably brings\nmore advantages right so that's the data\nMart and that's why I told you that uh\nyou know if you've understood so far\ntill ETL then half your job is done but\ndata m is something that that extends\nthe functionality of a data warehouse\nright so that is the thing and uh\nspeaking of the differences that is\nthere in this table the data warehouse\nwill store the Enterprise wide data\nright the Enterprise of the Enterprise\nwi data whereas data Ms will store only\ndepartments wise data there'll be\nmultiple departments in the whole\ncompany in the Enterprise and they will\nstore Department wide data and then the\ndata warehouse it will have multiple\nsubject areas okay but a data Mt will\nhave a single subject area there'll be\nmultiple data sources in case of a data\nwarehouse okay but in case of data M\nthere'll be limited data sources in fact\nthere can be just one data warehouse\nright this will act as a source to your\ndata marks but however we have said\nlimited here because not always do you\nneed a data warehouse there are also\ninstances where your data source itself\nact as an input to data M okay now that\nis something I'll that you will\nunderstand in the next slide okay so\njust don't get confused when we see that\nlimited data sources it doesn't mean\nthis is the only source they can also\ncome from a data a proper data source\nlike a flat file or from a a database\nand all these things all right and then\na data Warehouse it occupies a large\nmemory this of course because there's a\nlot of data Enterprise Way data will be\nstored here multiple subject areas will\nbe there because of that there's larger\ndata here at stake and that's why\nthere's greater memory that's occupied\nokay but in case of your data Mar it\noccupies limited memory because it's\nvery crisp and limited to only a\nparticular Department okay and then the\nother thing is data warehouse is long\ntakes longer time to implement but a\ndata Mart is a takes very short time to\nimplement because once you have all your\ndata where\nstuff in place you can easily divide\nthem by just creating different data\nmods okay so the tough part is your data\nW so once you've got your data warehouse\nsorted you can easily form your data\nmarks in fact there's even the other way\nthere are also practices where you first\nbuild your data marks and once you've\ndone that after that you create one\nsingle repository and that's when you\ncreate a data warehouse so there's also\ntwo approaches here one is the top\nbottom approach and the other one is\nbottom up approach so those are the two\nthings and uh I'll go into details about\nuh these two approaches in my next\nsession okay of course I can't do it\ntoday because we have very limited time\nall right so moving on to the next slide\nokay now speaking of the different types\nof data marks okay this is what I was\ntalking about in the previous slide so\nyou have three different types one is a\ndependent data Mark the other one is\nindependent data Mark the third one is\nhybrid data Mark your dependent data Mar\nis uh the data is first extracted from\nthe oldp systems and then populated in\nthe central data bearhouse and then from\nthis data warehouse the data travels to\nthe data Mar so look at this example\nokay this is the standard practice or\nthe uh the default approach where you\nhave an oldp Source then you get that\ndata into a data warehouse and then from\nthe data warehouse you form a data Mar\nokay you'll have multiple data marks\nwhere each different Mark will have\nparticular data from the entire data\nwarehouse okay this is the first regular\napproach and then you have the\nindependent data Mar which is a slight\nvariation compared to dependent so here\nthe data is directly received from The\nSource system okay you don't have a data\nwarehouse in place over here that is\nwhat this line means and this is\nsuitable for small organizations or\nsmaller groups within an organization so\nbasically an organization which is very\nsmall it might not need to go through\nthe T of creating a data warehouse and\nstuff so they can just have an oldp\nsource and from there they can just get\nthe data in onto a data M and they can\nuse it for various purposes okay that's\nwhat we have an independent data Mar for\nso that's the difference it just does\nnot involve a major data Wearhouse so\ndirectly the data goes to a data m in\nfact you'll have multiple data Mars over\nhere you'll have data m one data M two\nand stuff okay which will be coming\ndirectly from the olp source and then\nyou have a third type which is the\nhybrid data M so by definition you might\nknow what this is right by the name of\nby the the name itself is pretty obvious\nit's combination of these two the data\nhere is fed from both the oldp systems\nas well as the data warehouse okay so\nlook at this example for that instance\nyou the data here it's coming from the\noldp source as well as from a data\nwarehouse so this is what the hybrid\ndata Mar and depending on your company\ndepending on the size of your company\nthe requirements of your company or your\norganization you can choose one of these\nyou can model your entire datab base and\ndata warehouse in any one of these\nmodels either the dependent or the\nindependent data March or hybrid data\nMar all right so that's about the\ndifferent types of data Mars so moving\non to the next slide we have something\ncalled as metadata now people here from\nprogramming background or from the uh\ntechnology background you might all be\naware of what a metadata is metadata\nbasically is defined as data about data\nokay it contains data about where your\nactual data is stored supposing you have\nyour raw data right where is that data\nstored what is the size of that data so\nthese are the answers to these kind of\nquestions is what will be present in\nyour metadata your metadata will contain\nthe location of your actual data it will\ncontain the size of your actual data it\nwill uh contain details like which was\nthe source it came from and when was it\ncreated all these details will be stored\nin your metad data right so that's what\nmetadata is uh so that's how different\nmetad data is from regular data and\nmetadata specifically in a data\nwarehouse it defines the source data\nthat is a flat file relational database\nand other objects so the reason that we\ngive so much importance to metadata in a\ndata warehouse is because take the\nexample of any company that's having a\n24/7 business okay they have a rolling\nsales team that uh Works throughout the\nclock uh the 24/7 they have sales coming\nin data will be going into your database\nokay now in this case you cannot always\nuh you know keep adding data into your\ndata warehouse because you know that\ndata warehouse is not uh real time\ncorrect so you'll have to manually\nupdate your data into your data\nwarehouse uh probably at every day at a\nparticular time maybe at 6:00 every day\nin the morning or maybe once in the\nnight at 10:00 or at basically at\nregular intervals you've got to store\ndata into your uh data warehouse and\nthis whole strategy becomes difficult\nbecause you have to do this process\nevery day so every day when a guy comes\nin in the morning he has to look at the\nnew data that has come into your data uh\ndata base correct and then from that uh\ndatabase which is data source he has to\nadd that data to your data warehouse now\nthis process becomes difficult so that\nis where metadata comes in uh handy with\nmeta data you define the address where\nyour data source is okay you define the\naddress of your flat file from where\nyour data is coming in or your\nrelational data from where your data is\ncoming in and then you can also in fact\nstore the metadata of your data V where\nyou want the data to go so it basically\nyou know saves a lot of your time okay\nand this is the most common and the most\nuh you know unspoken fact about a data\nwarehouse so any professional that's uh\ndealing with data warehouse you would\nalways be using metadata because it\nsaves a lot of time because every time\nyou cannot be importing data from a\ndatabase you always have to get it from\nyour uh metad data by defining rules and\ndefining your source and your targets\ncorrect so metadata saves a lot of your\ntime and this is something I'll show you\na demonstration on okay and when I show\na demonstration you will understand how\neasy it is so you'll just write the rule\nsuch that you have your Source over here\nand then you have your destination over\nhere your target over here and once\nyou've written this thing you don't have\nto go back here so every day uh it might\npick up the data from here and it might\nmove to your data warehouse and all\nthese things it will update all the new\ndetails which are present in your\ndatabase and it will add it into your\ndata warehouse so that's what a metadata\ndoes it's a very big advantage and it's\none of the best strategies that we can\ngo for okay and then the final Point\nhere is metadata is used to define which\ntable is source and Target and which\nconcept is used to build business logic\ncalled transformation to the actual\noutput yeah this is what I told you\nright so it's used to define which is\nyour source and Target and how to build\nyour business logic called\ntransformation so transformation is\nbasically your act of converting your\nSource data into the form that you want\nto and what is the logic that you use\ncorrect so all the different uh the\nfilter criterias all the transformation\ncriterias all these things can be also\ndone using the m data correct so even\nthe process of getting the data from\nyour Source your destination it can\ninvolve extra additional steps which can\nsave your time and uh default process\nbasically so every time you have data in\na particular format you might want to\nstore it in a different format and for\nall that purpose you can use a metadata\nright so since things will all already\nbe defined here the work of metadata is\njust to get the data from The Source\ndefined and uh do the set of activities\nthat is required and which is already\ndefined it will perform all those\nactivities and it will store it in the\nplace where you want it to so that is a\nrole of for metadata correct so metadata\nis very very important it's very very uh\nvery highly used and it's actually the\nmost important or the let's say it's the\nepor of data warehousing okay this is\nprobably the best thing that can happen\nto data warehousing right so that's the\nthing about metad data guys now going to\nthe next slide we have the architecture\nso now that you know everything okay\nthese four terminologies are are more\nthan enough for you to understand the\narchitecture okay so let's understand\nthe architecture is so this is the\nentire architecture diagram okay so this\nis what you know data comes in from\nvarious sources it can come from either\na database or it can come from a flat\nfile and then that data an action of ETL\nwill be performed on that data and it\nwill go to the staging area okay this is\ncalled the staging area and this is the\nstaging database and the data that is\nstored over here it this is temporary\nData before the data completely moves to\nthe data warehouse it will be present in\nthis area okay and that is done by using\nthe act of ATL and also between moving\nto the data warehouse the uh process of\nETL continues so ETL process starts over\nhere and it ends over here okay and\nbetween the conversion it is temporarily\nstored in a staging area and this is\nmost often present inside the ETL tool\nitself okay like your talent or\nInformatica and all these things and\nthen this data will be stored in your\ndata warehouse so whatever is xaed\ntransformed and loaded it'll be loaded\ninto your data warehouse and in your\ndata warehouse you'll have metadata okay\nand of course you'll have your raw data\nand then you'll have your aggregate data\nokay and this is the reason why a data\nwarehouse is generally you know it's\nlarger in size because it has uh not\njust raw data your database which uh\nfrom where the data is coming in it'll\nonly have your raw data okay but your\ndata wehous will have additional stuff\nhere it'll have also your metadata and\nyour aggregate data and together all\nthese three things together is what help\nand you being you you doing your\nanalysis sooner okay this is what powers\nyour ability to do app online analytical\nprocessing okay so that's what a data\nwarehouse is and that's what it stores\nand then this data warehouse you can\neither your entire company can use a\ndata warehouse or if you want more of a\nSecurity based uh access then you can\ndivide it into different data marks\nwhere your sales team and your uh uh\ndifferent teams like here we have a\npurchase table and then you have your\nstock table so these are like three\ndifferent Mars data Mars for three\ntables like sales purchase and stock so\nyou'll have different tables here and\ndifferent teams can access different set\nof tables okay your purchase can be\nsomething that's uh used by your\noperations people right and then this\nmay be something that's used by your\nsales people and your stock maybe again\nused by your operations or your sales uh\ngroup so that's what each of these here\nuh you know defines you have your user\ngroup one user group two and user group\nthree and each group will be getting\naccess to different parts of your uh\ndata warehouse because your data Val\nwill be divided into different data mods\nand your data your different groups will\nget access to only that data which they\nwant to or which they can get access to\ncorrect so this way no group can get\naccess to every data that is present in\na data warehouse and there's Advanced\nthere's a little more data security in\nthis case okay same thing over here so\nthis group gets access only to this data\nand this uh data in this table or this\nuh Mt right and then this user group\ngets access to only the data that is\npresent in this Mart and in this m so\nthat's what the entire architecture\nlooks like and this is how the data flow\nis right so if you guys have understood\nthis much then you're ready to get a\ndemonstration correct guys and this is\nalso my last Topic in this presentation\nso right now I can go to my\ndemonstration and what I'll be doing in\nmy demonstration is I'll be using Talent\nokay so I'll be ex importing data from\nmy database I'll be using I'll be\ngetting it from my Oracle database and\nI'll be storing that into a data\nwarehouse which can be ready for any\nkind of analysis or visualization on any\nother visualization tool okay so this\nact over here which I'm going to show\nyou this is what powers your business\nintelligence right so are you guys ready\nfor the demonstration any doubts here\nguys okay great Ronney says he's all\nready he's all pumped up all right\nRonney that's very good so Jacob's also\nready and so is rajes are you rajes can\nI get a yes from you yes very good very\ngood Al boy rajes so let's go so let's\ngo to the next part of my uh session and\nthis is going to be demonstration where\nI'll populate a data warehouse okay I'll\nbe using talent for uh the data\nwarehouse activities and let's see how\nwe can import data from various data\nsources and create a data warehouse so\nfor our Hands-On session I'll be\nimporting data into my talent bi okay\nlike I said earlier I'll be using my\ntalent bi for my data warehousing and\nETL processes and I will create a data\nwarehouse out of using Talent bi okay\nnow the data set that I'll be using is\nthat of a 10,000 row table and a 50,000\nrow table okay so the uh there'll be one\ntable having 10,000 customer details\nokay and then there'll be another table\nhaving 50,000 rows of transactions which\neach of those customers make okay now\nbased on this data we have to find those\ncustomers who have the lowest number of\npurchases okay so right now my data set\nis present in my uh Oracle database okay\nso I have uh two tables and both my\ntables customers table and my\ntransactions table is present in my\nOracle database I also have them in my\nuh Excel so first let me show you how\nthey are present in my Excel file okay\nokay so this is my uh customer\ntable as you can see we have all these\ndetails right we have all these fields\nhere so we have customer ID we have\ncustomer name we have uh the address of\nthat customer City the country he's from\nthe contact number and his email address\nright and uh if I do this then you can\nsee that there are almost 10,000 Fields\nhere so 10,000 rows are there here so\nthis means that you know I have it's a\npretty big data set and I can use this\nin combination with my other table okay\nso here we have customer ID as the\nprimary key okay and if I go back to my\nother data set that's my transactions\ntable you can see that I have further\nmore Fields here I have those of invoice\nnumber I have stock code I have\ndescription I have quantity I have\ninvoice date unit price customer ID and\nproduct ID okay so there's a customer ID\nover here also so the customer ID is the\nprimary key over there and this is the\nforeign key over here so basically the\ncustomer ID is the same and I will have\nto do a lookup to that table with the uh\nhelp of my customer ID okay uh since\nthese are two different tables I can\ncreate my data warehouse with the help\nof this particular primary and foreign\nkey concept I can create a link and I\ncan create I can probably just uh link\nthese two tables with the primary key\nforeign key concept okay so um any\ndoubts guys I'm sure that you all know\nwhat a primary key and a foreign key is\nand if all anybody has a problem please\nlet me know okay so Rodney says I don't\nknow what's a foreign key okay uh so see\nRodney the thing is we have something\ncalled as a primary key and a foreign\nkey okay and we use these two columns\nwhen we want uh when you want to use a\ncombination of two different tables\nright so if you consider the example of\nuh this one then you can see that there\nare a number of uh columns here and not\neverything is matching with the details\nin that put in in the other table okay\nso only customer ID is the only common\nfield okay so there's a customer ID here\nand even in this table we have a\ncustomer ID now the thing is the\ncustomer ID is a primary key because\nit's uh it's constant and it's Unique\nfor each and every single record over\nhere so each and every customer here\nwill have a separate customer ID okay so\nno two customers will have the same\ncustomer ID okay and uh over here the\ntransactions here which has the invoice\nnumber the description of the product\nthat was purchased the stock code the\nquantity all these uh things are sorted\nby the customer ID okay so if you find a\nparticular customer ID more than once\nthen well here you can find the customer\nID more than once that's because a\ncustomer would have made more than one\ntransactions he might have you know come\non to their uh you know he might have\nbought from the same person more than\ntwice or Thrice or four times or\nsomething like that right so supposing I\ngo back to this person and I buy his\nproducts since it's a retail store I buy\nproducts say 50 50 times then I'll have\n50 different times my customer ID will\nappear here okay but however here I'll\nit will not appear again because uh it's\na primary key right here so that's the\ndifference so here the uniqueness is\nthere that's why it's called the primary\nkey in this case and here there's no\nuniqueness for the customer ID okay it\ncan appear more than once and that's why\nit's a foreign key over here and what\nwe're going to do is for every customer\nID over here right so for every customer\nID over here we're going to link it to\nuh this particular table with the help\nof uh this customer ID since the\ncustomer ID is a common field in both\nthe cases I can make a table which would\nshow which customer which would probably\ndisplay all these details along with the\nother uh columns okay now that's because\nI have customer ID which is common in\nboth the tables and using that I can\nlink the fields that are there in this\ntable and which are there in the\ncustomers table right so that's what I'm\ngoing to do now the similar thing is\nalso there in my uh Oracle database so\nlet me show you that so this is my SQL\nDeveloper GUI okay so I have two tables\nhere I have customers table and I have\ntransactions table right and then I have\na final table but uh this is not\nsomething which is relevant so this is\nnot something we'll be using but uh we\nhave the same two tables customer table\nand transactions table as I showed you\nwe have these two here and we have\nalmost the same Fields over here right\nbecause uh if you see the customer table\nwe have the customer ID we have the\ncustomer name we have the customer\nnumber and the email address okay and uh\nhere we have additionally we have the\naddress City and Country Now what I did\nis when I imported uh this Excel file\ninto my database I did not I ignored\nthese three columns right I didn't want\nthese details because uh I was not going\nto use them in my data warehouse so if\nyou see a problem statement here it it\nonly says you have to find out the\ncustomers who have the lower number of\npurchases it doesn't mention that you\nneed their country details or city\ndetails or anything for that matter of\nfact so so because so for that reason\nusing the country City and address\nFields would be a waste so that's why\nI'm not imported these into my data\nwarehouse I have only the customer ID\nthe customer name my contact number and\nmy email address Fields okay this would\nbe uh sufficient to find out the\ncustomer details okay and to find the\npurchases right and to see who has all\nthe lowest purchases we can use the\nother table so in the other table that\nis the transactions table we have uh\nthis quantity field right we have this\ncolumn this quantity table basically\nrepresents how many products this\nparticular person purchased so this uh\nperson with this customer right he\npurchased 71 products right and then you\nhave another person who is purchase 67\nprojects uh products and so on so you\nalso have people who purchased only\nseven or nine okay now our problem\nstatement is such that we have to find\nthose people who have made less a very\nless number of purchases okay now if we\nDefine uh uh less to be 10 then we can\nextract the data such that uh the data\nwarehouse gets the uh details of only\nthose people who have made purchases of\nless than 10 items per uh order right so\nper transaction Whoever has made less\nthan 10 purchases so this person has\nmade seven and this one this person has\nmade nine right so we can get a list of\nfor those customers right using the\ncustomer ID we can go to that customer\ntable and get his name we can get his uh\nemail address his phone number and other\ndetails okay and we can uh publish all\nthose things and we can probably export\nthem to another uh CSV file like this or\nwe can put that into our database uh\nbasically into anything which would\nsupport data visualization right so\nthat's what we want and uh this function\nis what our talent is going to do okay\nand what I'm going to do for that\npurpose is I'm going to do a lookup from\nuh this table onto my my customer table\nright so this is my transactions table\nand from here I'm going to use the\ncustomer ID field to to uh look up to my\ncustomer table to optain their name\nemail address and phone number and all\nthose things so first of all let me\nintroduce you to our talent interface\nokay so this was the Oracle SQL database\nwhich I showed you earlier and this one\nis the talent right so Talent Open\nstudio this is basically the data\nintegration version of the project okay\nnow what I'm going to do here is uh I'm\ngoing to show you how Talent works I'm\ngoing to show you the layout over here\nfirst of all so on the left here you can\nsee that you have something called as\njob design we have a standard you have\ndemo and then you have various other\nprojects here right so all these are the\ndifferent projects that I have created\nokay and when we say job design so job\ndesign is what you use to create your\njobs on the UI here okay so in our case\nin Talent whatever actions that we\nperformed right we got to do it with\nwith respect to a UI so we don't have a\nCod this is not a coding interface okay\nso of course this Talent runs on Java\nbut it we don't but Talent is known for\nits GUI okay so we can uh drag and drop\nthe items on the job task so this is the\nuh uh job design taskbar and we can\nfirst of all create a new task okay\nsupposing I want to create a new data\nARS by importing details from another\ndatabase then we can start by creating a\nnew job design okay okay and then create\na new project in that job design so\nright now we are in my local project so\nI'm going to create a new job design\nokay I want to say create standard job\nlet's give a name to this particular job\nso let's say data warehousing\nbi session okay and uh demonstration is\nthe purpose so I'm just going to copy\npaste the same details into my\ndescription field also and I'm going to\nsay finish okay now uh what you can see\nthis is the job designer so this is\nwhere I can get all the data from my\ndifferent uh databases or Fields files\nand uh get them to my data warehouse so\nI can run my I can write my projects\nover here and then on the right hand\nside you have your pallet okay so from\nyour pallet you can choose the files or\nthe database from which from where you\nwant to import your data okay supposing\nyou want to import from a flat file then\nyou can just go to this heading file\nhere so under file you have input right\nso under input you have all these\noptions so if you choose any of these\noptions here and if you just uh drag and\ndrop them over here then you can use\nthem as a means to import data you just\nneed to set the path where the Excel\nfile is stored okay and uh you can uh\nchoose that and when you just enter\nfurther Fields you can get the data in\nfrom these Excel files to your data\nwarehouse okay to your talent okay but\nuh Excel files is a very simple thing\nand I don't want to show you that let me\nshow you how to import this large data\nfrom our database right so we have also\nother options here like big data Big\nData int business intelligence we have\nbusiness we have Cloud right so we have\nIntegrations with a numerous\nTechnologies here and uh what we would\nbe conting now on is that of database\nright so I have my Oracle database so\nI'm going to go to Oracle under\ndatabases and under Oracle I'm going to\nsay t Oracle input okay let's see where\nis it t Oracle input is right here so\nI'm going to just click on T Oracle\ninput and paste it here okay I'm going\nto drag and drop it here and now that\nI've done this I can use this as a means\nto get my data in from from my database\nokay so this is my uh Oracle database\nright so let me configure my input first\nso first first of all I need to\nconfigure all these details with respect\nto my host the port number on which it's\nhosted the database name the username\nthe password and all these things okay\nso uh let me first start off from the\nhost uh it's hosted on Local Host right\nit's not on any server it's not on any\nremote server so I'm just going to say\nLocal Host and the port number is 1521\nso these are details that I got when I\nwas uh when I installed this Oracle SQL\nServer right so you'll have to probably\nenter the same details when you create\none and 1521 is actually the default\nport on which oracles Oracle servers\nusually host it so you shouldn't have\nany problem there so database here is xe\nin my case so okay and then my uh\nusername is Ban and the password is\nsomething we have to set over here okay\nall right now I've done this my\nconnection type is Oracle SSID my\ndatabase version is 11.6 all right so\nall these details here are correct now\nlet's check my schema the schema\nbasically is what is going to uh uh you\nknow map your fields from your database\nto your talent right so this is your\ndata wouse so we have to define a schema\nhere to add details\nhere okay so uh now that we have all\nthese fields here now let me go back to\nmy uh database right so we are in my\ncustomer table and in my customer table\nI have four Fields customer ID customer\nname customer number and email address\nso let me add uh these four fields in my\ntalent okay First Column is going to be\ncustomer ID this is going to be customer\nname this is going to be customer phone\nnumber this will be customer email\naddress all right so that's all fine\nbasically the data type that it's coming\nfrom is all Vare okay so if you see here\nthe data type that is uh it currently is\nis in is Vare okay they have different\nsizes though but email address be email\naddress or contact number or name or ID\nall are in Ware to type so I'm going to\njust uh say the input also to be as uh\nWare right so it's all Ware 2 everything\nis technically Ware 2\nit's it's picking up uh the same data\ntype by\ndefault all right so let's define the\nlength over here though let's say the\ncustomer ID is uh going to be five\ncharacters in length I'm going to say\nthe length for the name is going to be\naround uh 30 the phone number to be\naround uh technically it's 10 so let's\ndo a buffer of another 10 and say 20\nemail address is going to be another 20\ncharacters okay uh the customer ID let\nme just increase the length to 10 so\nthese uh these are the length of the\nfields uh which are going to be stored\nOkay so I'm going to set the length over\nhere and I'm going to say okay now what\nI going to do is I need to set the\ndefault query okay so I'm going to say\nselect star\nfrom customers select star from\ncustomers okay because customers is the\nname of the table in my Oracle database\nright so I'm going to choose the table\nname here I'm going to say the table\nname here also okay there's something I\nforgot earlier you got to mention the\ntable name that you want to import from\nand you got to specify the query you\nwant to run okay now let me run the same\nquery in my Oracle and let's see what\ndetails I get so I'm going to feed the\nsame query here okay so it's going to be\nselect star from customers so when I see\nthis I have this table option here okay\nnow let me just uh run this query okay\nso I've got the same Details In Here\nAlso right so my uh table name is\ncustomers so let me go to my talent and\nuh set that it's set as customers\nalready and this is the query same query\nI'll be running here by\ndefault all right I'm going to save this\nso uh I have set my first data in right\nso I've got my customer data in here so\nlet me uh say another T Oracle input and\nI'm going to configure another input for\nmy transactions table right so I have\nanother table for transactions so let me\nset that\nalso and as you can notice every time\nyou add a new uh input or configure a\nnew output then you'll have to add these\ndetails right you have to add the host\nname database name uh username password\nand all these things so instead of this\nyou have a shortcut here so you have a\nshortcut with respect to metadata so\nmetadata is something that I explained\nearlier right so it basically contains\ndata about your data so under metadata\ntab if you see you have uh DB\nconnections you have file all these\nthings right so so if you want to create\na standard input for data coming in from\na particular database then you can just\nset it once over here okay so under DB\nconnections you can set uh one\nconnection and it can be used in any\nnumber of jobs in this particular\nproject so instead of uh uh so this time\nprobably I'll have to anyways enter the\nuh details of this particular table okay\nbut uh if I set the same thing through\nmy metadata here then I can use the same\nmetadata every time I want to import\ndata to my uh Talent Warehouse so what\nI'm going to do is uh this time let me\nshow you how to do it through metadata\nI'm going to say uh create connection\nyou want to say the name of the\nconnection is\nDB input all right let's say database\ninput purpose to get data from Oracle to\nTalent let's have the description also\nand say finish okay we got to choose a\ndatabase type over here okay now the\ndatabase type that I want to import is\nthat of Oracle right and I'm want to do\nit with the help of Oracle with the\nservice\nname so when you choose that you have\nyour uh login you have your password and\nall these details so in place of your\nlogin give your username here so in my\ncase it's well done okay password is uh\nthis one the server is Local Host and\nthe port is 1521 service name is xe okay\nnow to verify if the connection is\ncorrect you can click on check over here\nso as you can see the DB input\nconnection successful uh message has\ncome okay okay this means that your\ntalent is able to successfully\ncommunicate with your Oracle which is\nhosted on port number 1521 okay so now\nthat I have done this I can straight\naway say uh finish and add this metadata\nover here okay now I'm just going to\nclick on the drag and drop this DB input\nover here when I do that I can choose\nthis to be for either input or output or\nanything here because under Oracle you\nhave all these options right so I have\nchosen this metadata for any of these\noptions here so if I want to use it as\ninput I can do that also if I want to\nuse it as output I can do it even at\nthat time so I'm going to say t Oracle\ninput and I'm going to say okay now as\nyou can see my uh DB input here this is\na metad data which has these properties\nalready inbuilt okay so in case of this\none I had to give it manually but here\nmy metadata I specified it once and it's\nalready replicated so the advantage here\nis that even if there are 10 different\ntables from which you want to get data\nin then you don't need to add 10\ndifferent database Connections in your\nTalent right when you're creating your\nmetadata if you create the database\nconnection once and then uh using that\none time you can establish 10 different\nconnections you can uh get it from 10\ndifferent tables or replicate the same\nthing again and again so that is the\nadvantage here right so that's the thing\nso next Let's uh give the table name\nhere okay so the table is transactions\ntable right so that's what I'm going to\nenter\nhere and the query that we have to run\nis Select start are from\ntransactions i ns transactions okay now\nlet me also verify if this uh query is\nrunning in my my SQL Developer okay and\nlet me run this query and yes it's able\nto fetch data from my transactions table\nalso now going back to my talent now\nthat I've said this let me go and edit\nmy schema now okay so where do I have my\nschema option okay it's right here so\nI'm going to say edit schema and I'm\ngoing to call config all the different\ncolumns and Fields over here if I'm not\nwrong there are five different columns\nhere invoice number description quantity\ncustomer ID and product right so I'm\ngoing to rename everything here I'm\ngoing to say invoice\nnumber\ndescription\nquantity what else do we have we have uh\ncustomer ID and product ID\nright all right so even the uh details\nhere have been set to Ware okay now this\nbasically means that I'm getting the\ndata from my database and the data type\nof that is Ware right so as you can see\nfrom here when I click on this all my\ndata all the fields have are of Vare 2\ndata type so that's why I'm setting them\nas Vare 2 over here and I'm going to set\nthe default length for everything to be\nas uh well not for everything so for\ninvoice number let me give a length of\n10 for description I'm going to give a\nlength of uh 100 for quantity let's say\nfive for customer ID it's going to be 10\nand for product ID again let me give a\nlength of 10 so I want to say okay so my\nschema is basically set for both of\nthese files now what I've got to do is\nnow I have configured two inputs now I\nhave to get these inputs into my talent\nnow to check if my data is coming in\nfrom my data sources appropriately let\nme uh just check the t log row right so\nthe component name is t log row but\nsince I can't find it here I can also\nsearch for it here so t log row when I\njust put uh enter I have these options\nright so just capture this t log row and\ndrop it here now you can create\nconnections from here you can say Main\nand you can establish a connection over\nhere okay and similarly I can use\nanother tlog row here okay drag it I can\npaste it here and\ncheck actually no I won't do that so I\ncan check if my data is coming to my\ntlog Row from here right so my component\nis added over here so let's\nsay so let's just check the schema once\nso as you can see these are the details\nthat I entered in my uh source and uh\nit's already been mapped since I gave a\nconnection between to uh between my tlog\nrow and my input one these fields have\nbeen mapped here also so I'll be getting\nmy customer ID customer name phone and\nmy email details here okay now let me\njust click on okay go down and uh yeah\nthe field separator would be this\npipeline I'm going to say print header\nprint content with log 4G all right so\nnow let me just uh save this and let me\nrun this now you can see the button here\nright when I say run it would build my\njob basically and it should be able to\nimport my data from there as you can see\nall my data is being imported to this uh\nlet me just minimize my screen so as you\ncan see all my uh details are here right\nso customer ID customer name customer\nphone and customer email were the four\ndifferent fields that I had configured\nto enter into my T grou from my input\nand they have come they have the headers\nare these and the details are here so\nfor customer ID it's th000 and the\ncustomer name is uh this one here and\nthen his phone number is right here\nright so this is his name here this\nentire\nand things like that so each and every\nFielder is separated by a pipeline so\nthat's because I had uh in the component\neditor over here because in the\ncomponent editor over here I had set the\nfield separator to be pipeline okay so\nthat is the thing so since my component\neditor has a pipeline so every field in\nmy data that has comeing through my tlog\nrow it has been separated by a field\nseparator that is pipeline now if I just\ngo back\nhere as you can see by just clicking on\nrun over here or over here you can get\nyour output okay this I've just done\nthis to show you how the data comes in\nokay so now that our data is coming in\nsuccessfully I'm just going to uh delete\nthis dlog row okay because we don't\nreally need it for our uh demonstration\nso you can just click on this clear here\nto clear your uh lock screen so now that\nwe've established our connection what we\ngot to do is we've got to merge these\ntwo tables right so we've got to create\na lookup field and I've got to make sure\nthat my tables are joined so for that we\nhave another uh component here called t\nt\njoin and when you hit enter you have\nthis right so under processing you have\nthis option of T join so you can just\ndrag and drop here and what this would\ndo is it would basically join these two\ndifferent inputs so we have the source\ninput of this one and this one right so\nit would basically merge the two of them\nso let's first uh create one link over\nhere to my D join and similarly let me\ncreate one over here from my input two\nto my tlog now if you can see here since\nthis was the first connection that was\nestablished this took up the name of uh\nmain okay and my second connection took\nup the name of lookup now that's because\nuh this table here this will look up to\nthe customer ID field in this table and\nmatch the subsequent rows or entities\nwith this particular columns right so\nwhat this uh lookup would do is it would\nuse the customer ID field in my uh in\nthis table and it would do a look up to\nthis particular table and match the\nremaining rows and columns right so\nlet's configure the schema for that\nfirst of all since we're joining these\ntwo we are using this T Joiner okay so T\njoin Let's uh go to the component and\nedit all the other details\nhere so we have to check this include\nlookup columns and output uh this means\nthat at the output that comes out of\nthis joint we want to also include the\nfields which are present in my uh lookup\nfield right so that's why I've checked\nthis column so besides that here it says\ncolumn mapping right so we have to\nalways map uh these two different tables\nusing one lookup field right so it's\neither one lookup field or the primary\nkey foreign key relationship so both are\nthe same uh so that's what we got to\nDefine here we got to Define which is\nthe primary key which is the foreign key\nor which is the lookup fure okay so\nfirst of all let's go to uh let's go\nedit the schema here all right so we\nhave the two different um field here we\nhave the input field one and the input\nfield two over here so let's add all of\nthese uh I'm going to say control a and\nI'm going to move it here all right so\nI'm going to join all these things and\nfrom the second table I'm going to move\nmy invoice number my uh description well\nI don't want to move description so I'm\ngoing to move my quantity customer ID is\nalready there so I would then want to\nmove my product ID okay now the reason\nI'm not moving description is because I\ndon't uh need description as for my\nproblem statement there's no need for\ndescription okay uh similarly even\nproduct ID is not really needed for me\nso I can actually remove this also right\nso I have these so these will basically\nbe my output Fields my customer ID\ncustomer name customer phone customer\nemail address invoice number and\nquantity right so these will be my\noutput fields and now that I've set my\nschema even the length has been Auto\npicked right so this is the nice thing\nabout Talent things are pretty simple\nand it's all straightforward so you can\njust click on okay so guys now that\nwe've set our schema here let's add the\ncolumns that we want in our output from\nour lookup table okay so this is our\nlookup table and from here what all\ncolumns we do we want in our output so\nthat we've got to include over here\nright so let me add the uh different\nentries so I ideally want my customer ID\nto be there so I'm going to say row to.\ncustomer ID uh row to here basically\nmeans this table right so and then I\nwant my quantity to come and that I'm\ngoing to set it as row to.\nquantity I'm going to add another uh\nentry here and that's going to be\nfor invoice number okay so I'm going to\nsay this is row to. invoice number all\nright so now that we've uh done our\ncolumn mapping here this is pretty uh\ngood enough now let's go down and set\nour key definition so here we set our\nprimary key and secondary key uh foreign\nkey definition okay so let me add an\nentry here so the primary key is going\nto be customer ID and the lookup table\nis going to be ru. customer ID okay so\nwith the help of these two Fields we're\ngoing to find our we're going to make\nour do our lookup and another Advantage\nhere is that I can also go back to\nschema and edit the data type of my\nquantity okay uh since I'll be using\nquantity as my uh differentiator for my\nproblem statement I can set the data\ntype to be something else I can set it\nto be integer okay\nso I can do this and set the length to\nbe either five or 10 right I can give\nokay so now this basically means that\neven though all these are in string\nformat my quantity can be an integer and\nthe best part about Talent is I don't\nneed to change anything over here okay\nso I can get the data in from any data\ntype the data that comes in can be of\nany data type okay but the data that I\nstore or the data that I Finly export\nthat I can change the data type of that\nparticular data so that that's the\nadvantage so quantity comes in the form\nof Vare 2 data type and I'm converting\nit into integer from inside Talent right\nso that's the thing about Advantage with\nTalent so I'm just going to say okay now\nall right so now that I've done this uh\nI think I'm done everything with respect\nto T join okay so now let's go back to\nmy problem statement for a minute now\nwhat they say is they wish to find out\nonly those customers who have a low\nnumber of purchases okay so it is\nquantity which defines how many\npurchases that they have right so I'm\ngoing to go back to my talent here now\nthat I've added my T login over here\nI'll will be getting all my details and\nall my data into this component right so\nmy uh input one would be giving me uh\nthose rows from customers and this would\nbe giving me those rows and Fields and\nrecords from my transactions table so I\nwould be getting approximately 50,000\nrows from here and 10,000 rows from here\nnow now that I have all these uh rows\nover here what I have to do is I have to\nfilter them based on the quantity and\nour problem statement here says that we\nhave to find out those customers who\nhave a low number of purchases and if\nyou remember we defined that uh when if\nyou want to find the low number of\npurchases it's not exactly defined so\nlet's say we want to find those people\nwho have less than 10 transactions or\nwhose quantity is less than 10 right who\nhave purchased less than 10 items so for\nthat we can just go back to our data\nwarehouse and create another filter\ncomponent here which would filter out\nthose people who have less than who have\npurchased less than 10 items per\ntransaction right so for that let's\nagain go back to my uh pet here and\nsearch for this component\nfilter so as you can see there is T\nfilter row and T filter columns okay but\nI want to filter rows so I'm just going\nto uh drag this and drop it here so t\nlog filter okay and I want to uh connect\nthese two right so now I'm going to give\na connection here and what I'm going to\ndo here is I'm going to define the the\nfilter criteria okay so I'm going to add\nan entry here but before that let me go\nto my schema and as you can see I have\nall these entries here and the same\nfields are here also right and even the\ndata type has been picked up by default\nthat's the talent functionality so this\nwill be the input that will come to my\nuh filter and this will be the output\nthat will go right so let's just uh\nclick on okay and now uh coming to my\ncriteria for filtering I want to filter\nmy quantity right so the input column\nthat I want to uh check is that of\nquantity okay and the function that I\nwould want to do is uh empty now for now\nlet let's just leave it empty and the\noperator is if it's uh lower than or\nequal to right so if it's lower than or\nequal to 10 that is the value that is\npresent in this column if it's less than\nor equal to 10 then I want to filter\nonly those uh rows and I want to send\nonly them okay so basically my uh\ncommand is also set over here all right\nso even my schema and my function is set\nover here and now what I have to do is I\nhave to set the output for my data\nwarehouse okay now where do I want to\nextract these uh results and store these\nthis data warehouse right so let's say I\nwant to store it in an Excel then I have\nto uh just go back to files over here\nlet me just type file and hit enter and\nuh I have these options right I have t\nfile input Excel T file output Excel so\nI'm going to choose T file output Excel\nand uh drop it here uh this would\nessentially mean that the uh results\nthat are filtered over here in this\ncomponent this would uh come and get\nstored in this Excel file which I'm\ngoing to create now okay so let me uh\nconnect these two also I'm going to save\nfilter and put it here and supposing if\nI want to also get a list of all those\npeople who have more than 10\ntransactions then I can do that also by\nusing this option of reject so whichever\nrows get rejected right whichever get\nrejected uh from moving to this\nparticular file those can go to another\nfile right so we have that functionality\nalso that I'll I'll show you even that\nbut before that so let me just show you\nhow this looks like so I've said row\nfilter T file output Excel and uh let me\nedit the component over here and uh\nlet's say the file name is uh this one P\nwhbi demo all\nright I'm going to say include the\nheader so header basically is the part\nwhich would say customer ID phone number\nand all those things so I'm going to say\ninclude header all right and uh I'm\ngoing to say Define all columns to Auto\nsiiz that's is just uh to Auto siiz\nthose columns right so it's all fine now\neverything set and my uh file would be\nsaved in this particular path okay and\nthis would be the name of my file which\nshould be stored when I run this so I've\ncopied this path now what I've got to do\nis uh I need to save this job and\nexecute\nthis okay when I executed that it's uh\nshowing me an error over\nhere okay so the error it shows is that\nthe error and the components properties\ntype mismatch cannot convert from string\nto integer okay not a big deal I can fix\nthis\nerror okay we we can fix that by first\nof all checking our schema right so here\nif you see the schema here it says uh\nquantity is type integer right but over\nhere quantity is still type string so\nthat is what we need to change we got to\nchange the uh type over here to integer\nso I'm going to say number and I'm going\nto click on okay\nfine okay so uh now let's go back to\nthis file right and let me edit the\nschema and set the properties correctly\nokay so it's not able to convert this\nright so the type is string and the DB\ntype is number so this is the problem so\nso I can change this also to integer\nright so uh integer is right here so I'm\ngoing to choose this as integer database\ntype I'm going to click on okay and uh\nnow let me go back to the tlog join and\ncheck the schema over here okay so this\nis my table and quantity this is integer\nthis is also integer it's coming here\nand now it will get converted over here\ninto this so now it shouldn't directly\nthrow me any error now let me just save\nthis and run this job okay building\njob okay it's showing an error again\ncannot convert integer to string okay so\nlet's see what the error is now\nokay so we have a problem here invoice\nnumber right so this is the problem so\ninvoice number it should uh be row to.\ninvoice number so this was the type\nmismatch error that we were getting\nright so no\nproblem okay so again it's changing\nright\nso all right I'm going to save this now\nand uh we w't have the type mismatch ER\nnow\nokay great so it says connected and\ndisconnected as you can see the output\nover here we've got around these many\nrows from this uh table and about 50,000\nrows from the uh table here and we've\ngot it here and then we would have\nprobably joined these two with the help\nof the customer ID uh field and then to\nmy uh t log row it would have filtered\nall the fields so we've got the input\nhas basically been 8342 number of rows\n8,342 rows out of which 8 41 rows got\nfiltered and stored in this Excel file\nawesome right so um let's just go to\nthis path and check if our field\ncontents are correct so this is the path\nwhere the file is stored right so I'm\ngoing to copy this path I'm going to go\nback here and paste this path so this\nwas the file that we created right and\nyes as you can see we've got customer ID\ncustomer name customer phone the email\naddress invoice number and the quantity\nokay and the best part is the quantity\nhere is sorted and it's only that Which\nis less than 10 right so that was the\ncriteria that we had set we had filtered\nfor those fields to be only less than 10\nand uh to show you further proof what I\ncan do is I can uh do this I'll add a\nfilter\nokay and if you can see here the only\noptions here are 1 to 10 okay that means\nnobody whose quantity was 90 or 100 plus\nhas been added over here right so so\nthis is how simple Talent is and this is\nwhat uh data warehousing is in Basics\nright so this is a very simple example\nthat I've showed you where uh you can\nget data in your data warehouse by\nfiltering some data from the database\nand probably you can use this data to\nmake your analysis or visualization on\ntblue or click view or any other data\nvisualization tool okay but there was\nanother thing that I promised you right\nI uh told you that you will have a\nfiltered row and you will have another\nuh reject Ed row so if this was the\nfiltered column then I can probably have\nanother Excel here I can say t file\noutput Excel so okay so T file output\nExcel I'm going to paste it here and\nwhat I'm going to do is I'm going to\nstart one I'm going to say reject and\nhere so the rejected uh fields or rows\nand columns are going to go into this\nparticular field okay so I'm going to\nname this also as rejected data all\nright so this is also going to be\npresent in the same path and uh let me\nedit the uh I'm going to say Define all\ncolumns size I'm going to say include\nheader and yep I'm going to save this\nand run it again when I run it again\nI'll have the same uh list of fields\nover here right I have the same rows\nover here right so as you can see the\nsame 841 rows have been added to this\nfile okay the filtered results are here\nand the remaining ones which were\nrejected they have gone to my new file\nand this file is called the rejected one\nso if I go back to that uh same path\nthis was the original one and reject\ndata is here so when I open here you can\nsee that the only options here are those\nof above 10 okay so if I just uh show\nyou with a filter column right so you\ncan see that there is nothing less than\n10 so that's the thing so that's how you\nfilter data that's how you get uh data\nin and uh all these things so that's how\nyou work with Talent guys right so you\nget data so the same thing here you can\nalso store it to some database right so\ninstead of uh having a file to Excel for\nthis I can just delete this and uh I can\njust delete this and uh let me go to\ndatabases first of\nall all right so here I'm going to say\nOracle and uh T Oracle output okay I'm\ngoing to paste it here and now if I I'm\ngoing to say\nreject or yeah reject right so all these\nrejected entries would go into this\nparticular file of mine so let me add\nthe components and edit the components\nhere the host details here it's Local\nHost okay Port is 1521 database is\nuh\nXE right yes uh it is xe and my username\nis Ban my password\nis\nedura all\nright so and then you have the action on\ntable right so the action is going to be\ncreate table okay so when we say create\ntable we've got to give the table name\nalso and the table name let's say\nrejected\noutput okay well I'm guting there's\nnothing by that name yep there is\nnothing here by uh that name so so we\nhave customers final table and\ntransactions right so we will have a new\ntable that will be formed over there so\nwith the action is uh going to be insert\nsupposing you want to insert or update\nan existing file then you can choose the\nvarious options but in our case it would\nbe create a new table and the action\nwould be insert okay so let me just uh\nsave this okay and run this\nnow so it seems like my new table has\nbeen created here let me just go go back\nto my SQL here Oracle table and we need\nto refresh this yes so as you can see\nthere's a new uh table that's been\ncreated and when you see here these are\nthe different fields error message was\nanother field that gets autogenerated\nand if you look at the contents of the\nfield you have all these\nright so guys that's how you get your\ndata back into your datab base right so\nearlier I showed you how to do it uh and\nStor it in an Excel file now I've showed\nyou how to create new table and uh how\nto get your data warehouse uh data back\ninto your uh database so that's the end\nof my demonstration all my uh queries\nhave been passed successfully now let me\njust quickly go back to my slides for a\nminute and yeah this Hands-On is what I\nuh completed showed you how to get data\ninto your data\nwarehouse so yeah so I think that brings\nus to the end of the session and let me\njust summarize whatever I did in a\nminute right so first of all I spoke\nabout uh the need for business\nintelligence and then I told you\nwhat is business intelligence why you\nneed it for your business and what is\nthe role of data warehouse and then I\nspoke about data warehousing right I G\nwent into the depth of data warehousing\nand spoke about the key terminologies in\ndata warehouse uh we have the ETL we\nhave data Mars we have the meta data and\nall these things and then finally we\nspoke about the architecture of the data\nwarehouse and we finish off the session\nwith the Hands-On demonstration of how\nto populate your data warehouse using\nTalent so\nguys that's it and uh thank you for\nbeing in the session that brings us to\nthe end of the session today probably\nwe'll have another session on data\narousing and I'll talk about more\nadvanced concepts like schemas right I\nspoke about the three different types of\nschemas right like Star schema snowflake\nschema Galaxy schema all these things so\nI will talk about all these things in my\nuh next session and probably also I will\ntalk about dimensions and fact tables\nand all these things right so doesn't\nseem like you guys have any doubts so if\nyou do have any doubts please put that\nin the chat box right okay so thank you\nguys thank you for being in the session\nprobably I'll see you all until next\ntime okay see you I hope you enjoyed\nlistening to this video please be kind\nenough to like it and you can comment\nany of your doubts and queries and we\nwill reply to them at the earliest do\nlook out for more videos in our playlist\nAnd subscribe to our Eda channel to\nlearn more happy
