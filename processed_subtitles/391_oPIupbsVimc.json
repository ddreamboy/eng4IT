  "text": "you know how your phone can actually\nhave a bunch of different applications\nthere's facebook and instagram and gmail\nand youtube they're basically all\napplications that run code that was\ncreated by the company so that you could\ninteract with their company\nwell a dapp or a decentralized\napplication\nis very similar in how it works except\ninstead of reporting back to facebook\nservers or tick tock servers\nthis app reports back to the blockchain\nyou're simply interacting with the\nblockchain through the application\nwelcome the whiteboard crypto the number\none youtube channel for crypto education\nand here we explain topics of the\ncryptocurrency world using analogies\nstories and examples so that you can\neasily understand them in this video we\nare going to explain\nexactly what a dapp or decentralized\napplication is\nhow they work and why they might hold\nthe key to the future of the technology\nfirst we're going to go over some of the\nbenefits of dapps and then we're going\nto cover the different types of them\nincluding a bunch of specific examples\nthe first thing you need to know is that\ndapps can only be built\non smart contract networks this means a\nblockchain like bitcoin\ncannot utilize dapps bitcoin was\ndesigned to only allow the sending of\nits native coin\nethereum however can utilize something\ncalled smart contracts which is code\nthat makes up a program so that it can\nbe ran\nto do more complicated things you should\ncheck out our video on smart contracts\nso that you're not confused throughout\nthis video\nbut in short they allow two people to\nmake an agreement written in code\nso that they don't have to trust a third\nparty to follow through they can simply\njust trust the code\nanother benefit is that since the code\nis out there to be run\nit is what we call open source which\nmeans anyone can look at the code\nthis allows a lot more trust to be given\nto the application\nwe can't really look at how facebook\nrecommends us friends to interact with\nor how google knows what we ate for\ndinner\nbut with any smart contract we can\nactually look at the code\nand see how it works this is a big\nbenefit over centralized applications\nnext dapps are also censorship resistant\nand this is a fancy way of saying they\ndon't have to answer to governments or\ncorporations or even specific people\nif the smart contract is coded to do\nsomething and it's triggered\nnobody can stop it naturally this is\ngood and bad\nbut it's really important for financial\napplications this way nobody can control\nyour money\nin history governments that have done a\nlot of bad things\nhave had the control of their citizens\nmoney there have also been cases where\nfacebook or twitter can actually ban\nor censor certain people based on their\nviews or opinions\na decentralized application will not\nallow this unless it's written\nto another big benefit of decentralized\napplications is that they will\nessentially\nnever go offline now there's been times\nwhere i've actually seen facebook or\neven youtube down\nmaybe their servers have a bug or\nthere's an outage or they simply just do\nnot work it's\nusually for a very short period of time\nbecause there's a lot of money involved\nbut technically the government could\ncome in and just shut them down since\ndapps run\non the blockchain they will actually\nnever go down because they are run by\nhundreds of thousands of computers\nall around the world it would be\ninfeasible to turn them all off if not\nit's impossible\nso now that you know what makes dapps so\ncool let's get into some examples of\nthem\nfirst off let's start off with financial\ndapps\nthere are actually many decentralized\napplications that provide a way for\npeople to invest in something called\ndecentralized finance decentralized\nfinance\nor defy is a new monetary protocol that\nuses blockchain to allow investors to do\nnew things\nand even some old things with their\nmoney with a ton of new benefits\nlet's go over some of the ways adapt may\nuse your money number one\nborrowing and lending so ave is a\nplatform that allows a user to deposit\ntheir ethereum or matic tokens to\ncertain smart contracts whenever you\ndeposit these coins and tokens\nyou can actually receive an interest\nrate on them allowing you to basically\ninvest with them\nave also lets you borrow tokens\nbasically if you have enough collateral\nalready deposited so without going too\nmuch in depth\nthis allows you to borrow at different\ninterest rates and even create\nspecific margin positions if you want to\nlearn more about ave we've actually\ncreated a specific video over this topic\nnumber two is providing liquidity so\nproviding liquidity\nis actually a very complicated idea but\nwe're going to make it simple\nin short there is not much money in the\ntokens out there to trade\nso investors can come along buy these\ntokens\nand then invest them in what is called a\nliquidity pool which allows other people\nto trade back and forth using their\ntokens\nthe traders pay a small fee that allow\nthe investors to earn a return for their\ninvestment\nit's a win-win situation and number\nthree are\nexchanges now as i mentioned allowing\ntraders to find a way to actually buy\nand sell their tokens is one of the\nissues in the decentralized finance\nworld\nexchanges are decentralized applications\nthat allow traders to take some of their\ntokens\nand trade them for another token usually\nwith really low fees\nalmost instantaneously and without\nneeding any background checks or\nidentification verification\nthat was a mouthful but what it means is\nthat you can sell a million dollars of\nethereum\nwithout anyone blinking an eye or asking\nany questions by the way these exchanges\nare actually called dexes which stands\nfor decentralized exchange\nnext up on the menu we have game dapps\nnow of course there's going to be games\ni mean programmers are the ones creating\nthese daps so they're going to find a\nway to gamify the space\nnumber one is cryptokitties so\ncryptokitties is a decentralized\napplication\nthat allow you to buy these little cute\nkittens technically what you are buying\nis the nft data of rights to that\ncertain token\nthat represents the kitty however the\nfun part of this game\nis that you can actually collect a bunch\nof these kittens and even breed them to\ncreate more kittens\nin the community the older generation\nkittens are usually the most valuable\nand you can actually sell them for a\nprofit or maybe sometimes a loss\nif you play the game long enough even\nmore so you can actually rent out your\nkitten to breed with someone else's\nkitten\nas a strange form of passive income on\nthe blockchain\nnumber two is something called zed run\nzed is technically a gambling\napplication since you buy nfts that\nrepresent\nracing horses and then race them every\nhorse has specific skills and a point\nsystem\nalso every race is recorded on the\nblockchain so you can see\nall of the races including the races\nyour horses have won or lost in\nthis game actually went viral for a\nwhile because it combined the\npsychological pulls of gambling\nwith the virality of a blockchain game\nnumber three\nis basically gambling so just like zed\nis technically a gambling app\nthere is an absolute massive list of\nblockchain gambling websites out there\nthat are technically\ndecentralized applications there are\ndaps that allow you to play\ngames like poker slots roulette even\nsimpler games like\ndice rolling or coin tossing in fact you\ncan actually code these applications\nso that the house always wins even if\nit's by one percent but people love\nplaying these games\nour next category is tracking apps so\nthere are actually many\napplications out there that read smart\ncontract data\nand information from the blockchain to\ndisplay it to you technically these are\ndecentralized applications but they're\nusually centralized and hosted on a\nsingle web server\nand in most cases don't require the\nblockchain specific code to work\nhowever they do read the data from the\nblockchain so we thought they deserved a\nspot on this list so zapify is actually\na website that collects information\nabout wallets that you have\nand the displays it all on one page not\nonly will it look at all the major daps\nout there and find out how much money or\ncoins you have\nit'll do it for many different networks\nas well zapperfy is one of my favorites\nbecause it's free to use and i can\nactually see\na dashboard of my entire blockchain\nportfolio in one place\nnow you should know there are many\ndifferent applications like zapify but\nwe thought we'd share the one that we\nuse\nthe next category is marketplaces number\none\nis cryptokitties again even though we\nput cryptokitties in the game category\nit deserves its own spot in the\nmarketplace category\ncryptokitties has proven themselves to\nbe an asset that people went crazy over\nin the last few years the price of some\nof these cryptokitties has skyrocketed\nand their dap that allows you to buy and\nsell these nft kitties is paving the\nground\nfor mass adoption number two is wearable\nso wearable and\nair nfts are two marketplaces for other\nnfts\nthat allow you to buy sell and even\ncreate new nft art that you specifically\ncan sell\nthese platforms or applications\nfacilitate the process\nand allow the interaction with the\nblockchain so an everyday person can use\nit\nlastly as an example of a marketplace\napp we have bedali\nbedali is a decentralized application\nthat allows you to buy things\nusing your crypto one of their main\nproducts is basically\ngift cards which they can actually\ndeliver anonymously and very quickly\nremember whenever you buy stuff with\ncrypto in the united states at least\nit is currently reported as a sale and\nbecause of that you have to pay\ntaxes although bedali does not report to\nthe irs so the liability is in your\nhands\nyou may see what we're saying here\nanyways before we get ourselves into\ntrouble\nlet's move on to the next category which\nis educational\nso this is still an early announcement\nbut we are actually currently developing\nour website into a decentralized\napplication where you can complete\nquizzes\nwatch videos read articles and gain xp\nthrough your metamask wallet\nonce you have enough experience you can\nthen mint limited edition nfts through\nour platform if you're interested leave\na comment if you want to be an early\ntester\none last dap that doesn't really fit\ninto any of these categories is\nsomething called\nens ens stands for ethereum name\nservice and we actually have an entire\nvideo explaining how it works\nin short ens turns those long ethereum\naddresses\ninto any address that you want for\nexample we actually own\nwhiteboardcrypto.eth\nso if you send any of your coins or\ntokens there it'll go to\nour wallet now as we in this video you\nneed to know that the categories that we\nlisted are just the major ones we wanted\nto share\nthis space is incredibly new and there\nare new dapps being built\nevery day in fact blockchain developers\nare one of the highest paying jobs this\nyear\nsimply because there is so much money\nbeing poured into the space\nand there's a lack of people knowing how\nto code it the sky's the limit and we\ntruly believe this space has a lot of\npotential\nfor positive growth maybe some of the\nbest developers that will ever be\nmay use our videos as resources to learn\nand be inspired\nat least that's our goal thank you guys\nso much for watching this video\nwe hope that you enjoyed it we really\nhope that you learned something\nand most of all as always we hope to see\nyou in the next video\n",
