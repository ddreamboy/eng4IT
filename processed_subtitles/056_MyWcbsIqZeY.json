some key\nskills so let's talk about the road map\nstep one learn the basics of cloud\ncomputing the first step is to\nunderstand what cloud computing is you\ndon't have to be an expert right away\nbut you need to get familiar with key\nConcepts like what is the cloud types of\ncloud models public private hybrid cloud\nservices virtualization and networking\nbasics\nthere are plenty of free resources out\nthere check out tutorials articles and\nintroductory courses on platforms like\nKERA ax or YouTube to build your\nfoundation step two learn programming\nand scripting next up coding as a cloud\nengineer you need to know at least one\nprogramming language some of the most\ncommonly used languages in Cloud\nenvironments are python popular for\nAutomation and Cloud native applications\nJava widely used in Enterprise level\ncloud systems go gaining popularity in\nCloud environments for its Simplicity\nand performance Additionally you want to\nget comfortable with scripting languages\nlike bash or Powershell which are\nessential for automating cloud\noperations step three choose a cloud\nplatform now it's time to choose a cloud\nplatform to focus on the three

compute this includes virtual\nmachines ec2 na AWS and serverless\nfunctions Lambda na AWS storage cloud\nstorage options like S3 in AWS blob\nstorage in Azure and Google Cloud\nStorage networking setting up virtual\nprivate networks vpns load balancers and\nfirewalls to secure Cloud connections\nsecurity implementing identity and\naccess management encryption and\nsecurity best practices to
