  "text": "the area of computer science that deals\nwith image classification\nobject detection video processing and so\non\nis called computer vision due to\nadvancements in deep learning\nespecially convolutional neural network\nor\ncnn it has been possible to do\namazing things in computer vision in\nthis video we are going to look at\nsome of the real life applications of\ncomputer vision the first application of\ncomputer vision is\nimage classification and object\ndetection this is something you already\nhave\non your mobile phone once me and my\nbrother\nwere walking in a park and we saw a\nplant\nwhich looked like a poison ivy but we\nwere not sure\nso i took my google pixel and google\npixel has this application\ngoogle lens used that it immediately\ntold me that this is poison ivy\nif you touch poison iv it can create a\nblister on your skin so it is very\npoisonous plant and that was my first\nexperience of using computer vision\nfor a real benefit also when i'm\nhaving so many pictures you know on my\ngoogle pixel\nfor finding pictures of fruits\ni have to just write fruits and it knows\nto identify those fruits so it is doing\nimage classification\nunderneath mostly using convolutional\nneural network\nand finding fruit images from all the\nimages\neven to identify people i have all these\npeople my mom my cousin brother everyone\ntheir pictures are there in my phone and\nif i want to find\nsomeone's picture let's say hersh petal\nis my nephew if i\nwant to find his pictures i just\nuh tag that this person is hospital and\nthe computer\nusing computer vision it will identify\nthe images so the image search\nthe object detection has been so much\naccurate\nusing a convolutional neural network\nespecially\nthe second application is in the field\nof banking\ni never go to a bank to deposit my check\ni have bank of america account\ni use my mobile application to deposit a\ncheck\nwhen i take an image of a cheque it will\ndo image recognization\nit will find out the check number the\namount\nwho is depositing the check and\neverything i'm going to play a\nshort clip by bank of america this is on\nyoutube\ndepositing a check is simple with our\nbank of america mobile banking app\nstart by opening your app signing into\nyour account and selecting\ndeposit checks then take a picture of\nthe front and back of the endorsed check\nwith your smartphone or tablet hold your\ndevice steady\ndirectly over the check and the photo\nwill be taken automatically\nonce both sides are captured the third\narea where it is being used is\nagriculture i'm again going to play a\nvideo from cambridge consultant it shows\nhow computer vision can help in\nagriculture area\nyou'll see a clip where it will be\ndetecting the\napples on a tree and that can give you\nan estimate on your yield\nas a farmer you can predict how much you\nyou are going to get\nespecially when you have big farms you\ncan use like a drone\nand do amazing things in the field of\nagriculture so let's look at that clip\n[Music]\nif we look back the 20th century was all\nabout making agricultural machines\nbigger but this clearly couldn't\ncontinue forever\nwhat we really need to be doing is\nlooking after plants and soil at a more\nindividual level\nso to do this we need to make machines\nsmarter\nand smarter means taking care of plants\nindividually\nweeding spraying and thinning or\nidentifying fruit not just counting them\nbut providing yield and science\nestimates\nwhat's missing is the ability for\nmachines to discern plant health\nor to spot weeds amongst a crop\nartificial intelligence is about to\nchange this\nmachines can now be trained to recognize\nshapes and textures\nthe example you're seeing is using the\ntexture of leaves\nto single them out as weeds or as plants\nthat need special treatment\nthe commercial success of systems like\nthese depend on taking into\nconsideration\nthe whole package the software hardware\nand the business case\nwe've seen these technologies make huge\nsteps forward and we're already using\nthem to deliver systems that just a few\nyears ago would not have been possible\nai is making new means of farming\npossible not just the machines\nbut the ways in which farming is done\nso the question isn't how will air\naffect your business\nit's how will ai prove your business\nthe next application that you all\nprobably know about\nis autonomous cars here in u.s\nif you get tesla 3 tesla model 3 or any\ntesla car\nit has this auto pilot feature and i'm\ngoing to again play a clip\nand it works i have seen that working\npeople can also\nsummon the car so i was standing uh\nin a parking lot with my friend once\nand his car was parked a little far away\nit was tesla model 3 and he summoned the\ncar so car automatically came to us\nalso when there was a rainy day\nand if my friend is shopping sometimes\nhe has a little\nchild so it might be hard to walk from\nthe store to a parking lot because it\nrains too much\nand on that occasion he will auto summon\nhis car\nand the car will automatically come to\nhis place\nso these are again the real life\napplication which i have personally\nexperienced\nand it is damn good and all of this is\npossible because\ntesla car has so many cameras it will\ndetect all the objects\nand do the decision making in a right\nway\nall of this is possible because of deep\nlearning and convolutional neural\nnetworks\n[Music]\n[Music]\nthe next big industry where computer\nvision is\nbringing revolution is retail here in us\nin new york city and in seattle there\nare amazon go stores\nyou might have seen the video but these\nstores actually exist\nand all these applications which we have\ndiscussed so far\nthey are happening right now it's not\nlike some dummy video\nin amazon go store there is no employee\neverything is been done by robots\ncameras and computer vision so\nlet's see a little video clip on amazon\ngo\nfour years ago we started to wonder\n[Music]\nwhat would shopping look like if you\ncould walk into a store\ngrab what you want and just go\nwhat if we could weave the most advanced\nmachine learning computer vision\nand ai into the very fabric of a store\nso you\nnever have to wait in line no lines no\ncheckouts\nno registers\n[Music]\nwelcome to amazon go\nuse the amazon go app to enter\nthen put away your phone and start\nshopping\nit's really that simple take whatever\nyou like\nanything you pick up is automatically\nadded to your virtual cart\nif you change your mind about that\ncupcake\njust put it back our technology will\nupdate your virtual cart\n[Music]\nautomatically\nhow does it work we used computer vision\ndeep learning algorithms and sensor\nfusion much like you'd find in\nself-driving cars\nwe call it just walk out technology\nonce you've got everything you want you\ncan just go\nwhen you leave our just walk out\ntechnology adds up your virtual cart and\ncharges your amazon account\nyour receipt is sent straight to the app\nand you can keep\ngoing amazon go\nthese were only few industries i\nmentioned actually\nthere are many more industries i am\ngoing to link a video from google\nplease watch that talk because there\nthey have mentioned\nin detail about applications of computer\nvision\nin various industries such as warehouse\nautomation\ndamage analysis medical is another big\none\nso it is disrupting pretty much all the\nindustries\nand all of this is possible because of\ndeep learning\nbecause of convolutional neural network\nin this deep learning tutorial series\nnext few videos are going to be on cnn\nconvolutional neural network it is also\nknown as cononet\nso we'll be doing python coding we'll be\ngoing over\nvarious concepts i hope it's you're\ngoing to like it it's going to be very\nexciting\nall the links of the videos clips i have\nshown in this particular video are in\nvideo description below so please check\nit out\nif you like this video please give it a\nthumbs up share it with your friends\nand i'm very excited to provide more\ntutorials on cnn especially so next few\nvideos are going to be in cnn\nstay tuned thank you\n",
