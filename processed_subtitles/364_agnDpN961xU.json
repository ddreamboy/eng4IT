  "text": "[Music]\nhello everyone\nthis is george from invensis learning\nwelcome to our youtube channel\ni am sure you guys might have heard of\ncyber security in today's session\nwe are going to have a brief tutorial\nabout cyber security for beginners\nso without any further delay let's get\nstarted\nwe will begin this session by discussing\na little about what is cyber security\nnext we will move further onto the\nhistory of hacking and security then\ntalk about cia triad\nalong with an example post that we will\ntake a look at\nwhy we need cyber security and then\nelements of network security\nmoving on we will discuss the types of\ncyber attacks\nthen case study then basic practices and\nmethods to avoid cyber attacks\nwe will then talk about job prospects\nand market trends and cyber security and\nthe role of cyber security analysts\nand finally we will end this session by\ndiscussing the top 10 cyber security\ncertifications and training\ni hope the agenda is clear to you guys\nwe will now begin the presentation and\nunderstand what is cyber security\nso what is cyber security cyber security\nis the set of practices used to protect\ncomputers\ncomputer servers mobile devices various\nelectronic systems\ncommunications and computer networks and\ndata from malicious attacks and threats\nit is also known as information\ntechnology security or electronic\ninformation security\nlet us discuss an example of cyber\nsecurity this is about a cyber attack\nconducted on the united nations website\non august 11 2007 the united nations\nwebsite was hacked by turkish hacker\nm125\nthe united nations official website was\nhacked and displayed a message\nthat protested the usa and israeli\npolicies in the middle east region\nthis message was seen in the section of\nthe site reserved to statements by\nsecretary general ban ki-moon\nthe message also appeared on other web\npages that usually display quotes and\nspeeches from the secretary-general\nafter the hacking the united nations\nwebsite showed the message\nhacked by karem125m zerostat and zee\nthat a cyber protest hey israel and usa\ndon't kill children\nand other people peace forever no war\nthis message was displayed continuously\non the website\nthe hacker group called themselves cyber\nprotest a three-member group of karem\n125\nm zero stead nz and pseudonames\ngenerally used by hackers\nthey also hacked websites of harvard\nuniversity the united nations\nenvironment program\nand companies like toyota and nestle\nhacking has been done even before the\nadvent of computers in the internet\nwhere phones and communication lines\nused to be tapped to gain information\nlet us now look into the history of\nhacking and security the timeline of\nhacking and security started in 1962\nwith the first troll attack\nwhen mit or massachusetts institute of\ntechnology\nsets up passwords for computers for\nsustaining time limits and student\nprivacy\na punch card was made by a student alan\nshare who tricked the computer into\nprinting off passwords\nhe then used them to log in as other\npeople after his time limit is completed\nhe even shared these passwords with his\nfriends also called as troll\nwhich was the first of its kind they\nalso made fun of their teacher by\nhacking into his account and leaving\ndifferent messages\nin 1969 a ucla student tried to transmit\nthe word login\nto another computer at the stanford\nresearch institute over the arpanet\na precursor to today's internet after\nthe alphabets ino are sent\nthe system immediately crashes so\nthe first message ever sent on the\ninternet was low\nhowever after one hour the full word\nlogin was immediately sent after\nrecovering from the crash\nin 1970 nokia and motorola were hacking\nvictims when kevin mitnick broke into\none of the world's most highly protected\nnetworks\nhe did this using social engineering\nmethods\npretending to insiders so that they hand\nover passwords and codes\nand then use the codes to access\ninternal computer systems\nhe was one of the most wanted hackers of\nthe time\nin 1972 a message said i'm the creeper\ncatch me if you can creeper the first\ncomputer virus in history\nwas developed by bob thomas a programmer\nat bbn technologies\nafter infecting a computer creeper will\ndisplay its message\nand start printing a file and before the\nprinting would be finished\njump to the next computer across the\nnetwork disappearing from the first\nreaper the first antivirus was developed\nagainst creeper\nrabbit virus arrived very shortly after\ncreeper in particular\nin 1972 the main difference is that the\nrabbit virus\nreproduced itself on the affected\ncomputer until it takes over the system\nand causes it to crash\nin 1979 midnight gained unauthorized\naccess to a computer network\nhis friend gave him the phone number for\nthe ark\nark is a computer system that digital\nequipment corporation or deck used to\ndevelop its operating system software\ncalled rsts\ne mitnick copied dex company software by\nbreaking into its computer network\nthis was called the ark cyber attack in\n1986\nhess dirk and peter carl hacked into the\nlawrence berkeley national laboratory\nsystems\nhesse also hacked into united states\neurope and east asia\nmilitary and industrial computers and\nsold the information to the soviet union\nkgv\nhesse is estimated to have hacked into\n400 usa military computers with\ninformation access to space\naircraft satellite and other\nconfidential information\nin 1987 the first publicly documented\nremoval of a computer virus was\nperformed\nby brent fix in the year 1987. an\nanti-virus program to counter the polish\nmks virus was released in 1987.\nthis gave birth to the first commercial\nanti-virus in the world\nin 1990 the english computer journal pc\ntoday reported about the disk killer\nvirus\neach issue of the magazine was\naccompanied by a disk\nthe july issue was infected with a copy\nof the disk killer\nmore than 50 000 copies were sold disk\nkiller was unable to spread because of a\nbug in the infection routine\npc today launched a recall and tightened\nvirus protection measures for the future\nin 1999 melissa virus a macro virus\nwas circulated as an email attachment\nthat when opened\ndisables a number of safeguards in the\nmicrosoft word 97 or\nword 2000 and if the user has the\nmicrosoft outlook email program\ncauses the virus to be recirculated to\nthe first 50 people in each of the users\nemail address books\nmelissa virus had the potential to\ndisable corporate and any other mail\nservers as the ripple of email\ndistribution becomes a much larger wave\nmelissa virus caused the microsoft\ncorporation to shut down the incoming\nemail\nin 2000 there was a problem called the\ny2k\nproblem or y2k bug where the dates\nbeyond december 31\n1999 would be interpreted as ooo for\n1900 instead of 2000.\nfor this programmers used a technique\ncalled windowing which would take all\ndates from 000 to 20s from the 2000s and\nnot from the 1900s\nalso in the year 2000 the first free\nantivirus was released in the market\nin 2012 an online battle emerged between\nsaudi arabia and israel\na saudi hacker called xerox omar posted\ndetails of 400\n000 saudi citizens credit cards on the\ninternet as a retaliation to this\nisraeli hackers broke into the websites\nof two major era banks\nin 2013 and 2014 there were two\ndifferent data breaches on the yahoo\nservers\nconducted by an unauthorized third party\nit was believed that almost 3 billion\nuser accounts were affected during this\nperiod\nin 2017 there was a ransomware attack\ncalled as the wannacry attack\nwe will discuss this in detail in the\ncoming sessions\nin 2019 there was a ddos attack\nconducted on the new zealand stock\nexchange market\nthis caused the stock exchange market to\ncompletely shut down for four days\nafter the systems crashed in 2020\n450 active world health organization or\nwho staff\nemail addresses and passwords were\nleaked online along with thousands\nbelonging to others working on the novel\ncoronavirus response\nin the same year over five hundred\nthousand zoom accounts were compromised\nand sold on the dark web and hacker\nforms for less than a penny each\nand in some cases given away for free\nthese were shared\nso that hackers can use them in zoom\nbombing pranks and malicious activities\nas we have seen till now these cyber\nattacks and threats\ncome in all types and sizes and impact\nvarious sectors\nthe growing cyber attacks cost the world\neconomy more than one trillion dollars\nalmost one percent of the global gdp\nwhere a company or an individual's\ncredentials their bank account details\nand other confidential information is at\nrisk\nlet us now discuss about the cia triad\nalso called as the confidentiality\nintegrity and availability triad the cia\ntriad short form for confidentiality\nintegrity and availability is a model\ndesigned to provide various companies\nand organizations guidelines to help\nthem create their security policies\ncyber security involves protecting data\nand information from unauthorized access\ndeletion or modification to provide\nconfidentiality\nintegrity and availability we will now\ndiscuss these components and some of the\ninformation security measures designed\nto assure\neach of the components safety the first\none is confidentiality\nconfidentiality involves preventing any\naccess of data to unauthorized\nindividuals\nit ascertains the identity of authorized\npersonnel involved in sharing and\nholding data secure\nprivate and anonymous confidentiality\ncan be compromised by hackers who crack\npoorly encrypted data\nincorporate various types of cyber\nattacks and disclose sensitive data\nthis is very important in the context of\ninformation security\nthe second one is integrity integrity is\nusually protecting the information from\nbeing altered by unauthorized\nindividuals\nit denotes that data and programs can be\nchanged by authorized personnel\nintegrity can be compromised especially\nby cyber crimes when malware is embedded\ninto web pages or when a machine is\nturned into a zombie computer\nthis helps the users to trust the system\nthey are putting to use\nthe third and last one is availability\navailability is ensuring that authorized\npersonnel has access to the data or\ninformation when needed any data is of\nhigh value if the concerned individuals\nhave access to it at the required time\nunavailability of information usually\noccurs when security incidents such as\nhuman error\nprogramming errors ddos attacks or\nhardware failures\nlet us now look into a real-time example\nexplaining cia triad\na bank atm that offers users access to\ncash bank balances\nand other information is the best\nexample of the cia triad\nit covers all three principles of the\ncia triad\nit provides confidentiality by ensuring\na two-factor authentication\natm card and password before allowing\naccess to data\nthe atm and bank software incorporate\ndata integrity by ensuring that any\ntransfers or withdrawals made through\nthe atm are reflected in the accounting\nfor the user's bank account\nthe atm provides availability because it\nis present in a public place and is\naccessible even when the bank branch is\nclosed\nlet us now understand why we need cyber\nsecurity there are three main reasons\nwhy we need cyber security\nthe first one is protection from cyber\nattacks the second one is ensure privacy\nof information\nthe third and last one is provide\nguidelines for data security\nlet us now look into the elements of\nnetwork security there are four elements\nof network security\nthe first one is network access control\nthe second one is firewall security\nthe third one is intrusion prevention\nsystem the fourth one is security\ninformation and event management\nor short form for seam let us now look\ninto each element in detail\nnetwork access control allows the\nnetwork admin to understand and control\nwho can and cannot access the network\nfirewall security decides whether\nspecific traffic in the network has to\nbe blocked or allowed\nthis is one of the most important\nelements to maintain protection\nintrusion prevention system is a threat\nprevention technology that examines\nidentifies and prevents unusual network\ntraffic from exploiting vulnerabilities\nseam or security information and\nevent management combine security event\nmanagement and security information\nmanagement into one composite security\nmanagement system\nnow we will discuss about the different\ntypes of cyber attacks\nwhat are cyber attacks a cyber attack is\nan offensive action taken by a hacker or\nunauthorized individual or a group of\nindividuals\nwho target computer systems i t\ninfrastructure computer networks\nmobile devices and other computer\ndevices by using different methods to\nbreak into\nsteel damage or alter crucial data and\ninformation\nindividuals or groups of individuals who\nconduct these cyber attacks are called\nhackers or cyber criminals\ntoday almost 59 percent of the global\npopulation are using the internet either\non mobile devices or computers and\nlaptops\nthere has been tremendous development\nand growth in technology and these\nconstant advancements come with many\nrepercussions\nhackers have started coming up with\ndifferent ways to gain unauthorized\naccess and conduct cyber attacks for\nmonetary and information thefts\nlet us look into the different types of\ncyber attacks the first type of cyber\nattack is called fishing\nphishing is one of the most used types\nof cyber attacks\nthe attackers by this method try to get\naccess to personal information like\nlogin credentials\ndebit or credit card details by\npretending themselves as concerned\ncompetent authorities\nphishing is executed mainly through\nemails messaging\nand phone calls the next type of cyber\nattack is called the ransomware\nin a ransomware attack the user is\ncompelled to remove all of their data\nand information from their system if\nthey fail to meet the timeline and\npaying a ransom declared by cyber\ncriminals\nin spite of all this there is no\nguarantee as to whether paying the\nransom would secure their\ndata or not let us now look into a\nrecent 2017 ransomware attack called\nwannacry\nin the wannacry attack the hackers would\nsend a malicious email to make victims\nclick on an attachment or visit a\nwebsite\nthe ransomware uses the flaws in the\nwindows operating system to force it to\nrun the ransomware code in the system\nthe ransomware then encrypts or locks\nall the important files in the system\nand demands a ransom in bitcoin\ncryptocurrency\nthe wannacry ransomware uses the\noperating system flaw to replicate\nitself\nand spread around the computer network\nthe hackers however\nmade a mistake a kill switch was\ndiscovered by another hacker\nwhich helped in overcoming this attack\nmicrosoft also released a patch update\nboth these measures help the users to\nregain access to their documents\nthe next type of cyber attack is called\nmalware in a malware cyber attack\nthe hackers create a malware code to\nhack any electronic or digital device\nlike mobiles\ncomputers and laptops to obtain\nunauthorized access\nnow we are now going to discuss the man\nin the middle attack\na man in the middle cyber attack or mitm\nattack occurs when the hacker places\nhimself in between the client and the\nowner or between users and the server or\nbetween\nclients and server to misinform the\nclient and get unauthorized access to\ndata and information from the system\nin this attack the hacker places himself\nin the middle of the communication link\nbetween the user or client and the\nserver\nall data and information transfer of\nboth the user and the server goes\nthrough the hacker\nthis gives the hacker unsolicited access\nto complete information of the whole\ndigital system\nand also the chance to misinform the\nuser or client this is how the hacker\ngains complete control over the whole\nsystem\nthe data transferred and the processes\ninvolved in it\nhowever all the time both the user and\nserver are unaware of the hacker\nand for any outsider it seems that it is\na normal client server communication\nsystem\nwe will now discuss the next type of\ncyber attack called as the trojan horse\na trojan horse or a trojan is a malware\nprogram designed by hackers to break\ninto electronic and digital devices by\ndisguising the program\nthe necessary software this type of\ncyber attack is quite dangerous as it\nhelps the hackers to have unauthorized\naccess to crucial information of users\nsuch as their credentials and financial\ndetails the next type of cyber attack is\ncalled as the sql injection\nsql injection is the latest type of\ncyber attacks being launched by hackers\nthis includes incorporating malicious\ndata into the user's digital device to\nenable the hacker to give unauthorized\naccess to all the crucial and\nconfidential information belonging to\nthe user\nwe will now see and understand what dos\nand ddos cyber attacks are\nin a client server communication system\nthere are three level handshakes before\nthe data from the server is transferred\nto the client system\nthe first handshake is client's request\nto the server to load the webpage or any\nresult or any content\nthe second handshake is where the server\napproves the client's request\ngets ready to load and asks the client\ndevice when to load\nin the third handshake the first device\nacknowledges and the server loads the\nrequest\nerror 404 reflects when a web page\ndoesn't load\nthe website is down or there's a lot of\ntraffic on the website\nit is detrimental to the profits of the\norganization\nthis happens when the number of users on\nthe website on that page exceeds the\nlimit the website can handle\nonce it exceeds the page is down and the\nusers get this error\nwhat happens if someone fakes the number\nof users currently using the website and\nthe website gets down\nintentionally this is precisely what the\ndos and ddos attacks are\nthe dos attack stands for denial of\nservice attack\nddos stands for distributed denial of\nservice attack\nin a dos attack the fake requests are\nmade by the same device to overwhelm the\nwebsite\ncausing it to crash in a ddos attack a\nbig network of devices creates a large\nnumber of fake requests and together\nrequests the server at the same time\nin a ddos attack big network devices\ncreated by the hacker are called botnets\nthe botnets create a large number of\nrequests and together all request the\nserver at the same time\none botnet creates one or two requests\nin both the attacks the hacker fakes the\nnumber of users currently on the website\nonce this number exceeds the limit the\nwebsite cannot handle this anymore\nand it crashes down this crashing is\ndone intentionally by the hacker so that\nit affects the owners of the website\nwe will now see spear fishing and whale\nfishing in a spear phishing attack a\nhacker tries to gain\nunauthorized access to confidential\ninformation by conducting fraudulent\nemails or phone calls\nin a well-fishing attack a hacker tries\nto access confidential and sensitive\ninformation of powerful and famous\npersonalities like chairman\nand head of organizations let us now\ndiscuss drive-by cyber attacks\nin a drive-by attack hackers embed\nmalicious scripts into various websites\nwhenever a user tries to visit the\nwebsite all the user data is accessible\nto the hacker\nbecause of these malicious scripts the\nsystem gets corrupted\ngiving unauthorized access to data and\ninformation to the hacker\nthe next type of cyber attack is called\nthe spyware hackers use cyber attacks\ncalled spyware\nwhich is unwanted software to infiltrate\ninto a victim's computer in order to\nhave access\nto their sensitive information and\ninternet usage data\nit is a type of malware that uses\nmalicious software to gain access and\ndamage a computer without the knowledge\nof the user\nthere are again four types or categories\nof spyware commonly called as\n1 adware 2. keyboard loggers\n3. trojans 4. mobile spyware\nthe next type of cyber attack is called\nthe adware the cyber tax where hackers\nuse various pop-up advertisements\nto show up on a computer or mobile\ndevice are called adware\nshort for advertising software the\nadware can become dangerous by harming\nyour device\nhacking into your browser slowing down\nthe device and install viruses or\nspyware or both\nthe next type of cyber attack is called\nthe eavesdropping attacks\nwhen hackers launch a cyber attack by\nhacking into cell phones\ncomputers and laptops by fabricating\ninformation in those devices\nit is called an eavesdropping attack\nthis attack is conducted to gain\nunauthorized access to files by cyber\ncriminals\nthe next type of cyber attack is called\nthe password attacks\na password attack involves continuous\nattempts by a hacker to obtain the login\ncredentials of a user\nmany hackers use different algorithms or\nsimply make calculated guesses to obtain\nthe password we will now look into a\ncase study of cybersecurity\njeep cherokee is a famous suv with\noff-roading capabilities\nthere was a jeep cherokee cyber attack\nin 2015 which turned out to be a turning\npoint for the automobile\nindustry charlie miller and chris\nvelasque two security researchers\nremotely hacked the jeep cherokee\nvehicle and took over control of its\nfunctions\nincluding the air conditioner radio\nwipers brakes\nsteering wheel and accelerator due to a\nloophole in the car's infotainment\nsystem\nthis was the first time a remote cyber\nattack was done on a vehicle\njeep cherokee was selected because of\nits simple architecture\nafter this attack fiat chrysler recalled\nmore than one million hackable vehicles\nfor security patch updates\nthe hackers first targeted the\nmultimedia system by hacking the wi-fi\nand compromising the automatic password\ngeneration that occurs each time the car\nstarts\nthey use hacking techniques to break\ninto the system remotely\nthe main vulnerability they found out\nwas that the wi-fi password is created\nbefore the actual date and time are set\nand is based on a default system time\nduring which the infotainment system\nstarts they then took over the\ninfotainment system by exploiting the\nsoftware\nby controlling the infotainment system\nremotely various cyber attacks such as\nchanging the air conditioner settings or\nincreasing the fan speed\na sudden change in the volume of the\nradio or turning off gps were launched\nsince the car infotainment system uses a\ncellular connection to provide access to\nthe internet and other services they\nexploited this vulnerability to deliver\nthe attack\nlet us now look into the solution that\nwas designed for this cyber attack\nharman created a five-step plan to\ncounter future cyber attacks and avoid\nany in the first place\nthe five steps are change organizational\nstructure\nscrutinize third-party software proven\ncyber security at the development stage\ncreate risk analysis of threats\nover-the-air software updates\nwe will now go through each of the five\nsteps organization structure\nharman kardon the company whose\ninfotainment system was used as the\ngateway to launch the attack\nchanged its organizational structure and\nappointed cyber security professionals\nto oversee issues at every stage\nscrutiny the software at every stage of\nthe production process\ncreate a checklist that involves\nscanning third-party software for errors\nand bugs\ncreating a risk analysis of potential\nloopholes for every involved component\nproven security if any new feature or\ncomponent is added to a vehicle\ndesigners now first have to demonstrate\nhow they would secure the operation from\nany potential cyber attack which might\nhappen at a future stage\nrisk analysis creating a risk analysis\nat every stage of the development\nprocess and undertake comprehensive\ntesting to ensure efficiency and avoid\nany future risks in terms of cyber\nsecurity\nover-the-air updates till now only\nsecurity patch updates were released for\nany cyber tax\nbut since automobiles are used over a\nlonger period of time over the air\nupdates with the latest version for all\nexisting customers is a must\nwe will now discuss the most crucial\npart of today's discussion\nbasic practices and methods to avoid\ncyber attacks best practices and methods\nto avoid cyber attacks include the steps\nand methodologies involved to keep\noneself and any organization on the\nwhole\nsafe and secure both internally and from\nany external threats\nbe it cyber attacks or any viruses or\ncomputer worms\netc these practices and methods help in\na smooth and safe operating environment\nand include keep your user data private\ncheck your privacy settings update your\nantivirus\nuse strong passwords scan emails before\nopening check website url\nlog out as and when required respect\nothers\nlet us now look into each of these in\ndetail data privacy\nalways make sure that you keep your data\nprivate so that it reduces the\nchances of data leakage in the advent of\na cyber attack\nstrong password having a strong password\nis of utmost importance\nsince hackers first target the user\ncredentials in order to gain\nunauthorized access\nprivacy settings maintaining strong\nprivacy settings to all your work\nbe it on mobile devices or laptops or\ncomputers\nacts as the first line of defense\nagainst hackers anti-virus\nhaving a reliable and strong anti-virus\nhelps against any malicious software\nviruses computer worms and other\nprograms developed in order to deliver a\ncyber attack\nscan emails it is highly recommended to\nscan your emails before opening them\nthis helps in a way to avoid the chances\nof various email hacking attacks usually\nused by hackers\nwebsite url a website that starts with\nhttps\nis far more secure than the ones that\nstart with http\nthe additional protection provided\nalways counts in the advent of any cyber\nattack\nrespect others having respect for others\nprivacy and confidentiality is crucial\nespecially that more and more people are\nconnected to the internet this is\nimportant in every regard\nlog out every time you complete your\nwork and don't intend to use the system\nlog out of the system this is a\npreemptive measure\nas it avoids prying eyes from breaking\ninto your account we will now discuss\nthe job prospects and market trends in\ncyber security\nnow we will discuss the cyber security\njob prospects\nthe job prospects include cyber security\nspecialist\ncyber security consultant incident\nresponder cyber security administrator\ncyber security manager cyber security\nauditor\ni t forensic expert vulnerability\nassessor\npenetration tester cyber security\nengineer let us now see the cyber\nsecurity market trends\nafter a global cyber security market\nforecast was predicted by statista.com\nit was observed that the global market\nfor cyber security is projected to grow\nfrom 167\nbillion dollars in 2019 to 248.26\nbillion dollars by 2023\nattaining a 10.4 cagr the expenditure on\nworldwide security on identity access\nmanagement was at 10.58 billion dollars\nin 2019\nthe forecast also predicted that\nexpenditure on security services\nthe largest chunk of the information\nsecurity market also reached 64.24\nbillion dollars in 2019 as well\nlet us now look into the role of cyber\nsecurity analyst and how to become a\ncyber security analyst\ncyber security analyst is one of the\nmost rewarding career options in the\nfield of cyber security\nan analyst in general collects\ntranslates and uses complex data to\ndesign actionable steps to improve\nprocesses and optimize results bringing\nvalue to the organization\nevery day analysts assess company and\nclient needs\nreceive information and analyze it\nlooking for any trends or areas for\nimprovement\na security analyst ensures sensitive and\nproprietary information of an\norganization to be safe and secure\nit is a vital role to detect and rectify\nissues or defects in the applications\nsecurity systems and programs of an\norganization it is the duty of the cyber\nsecurity analyst to suggest ways to\nenhance the overall security and\ncommunicate the specific measures to be\ntaken\ncyber security analyst creates maintains\nand controls the measures to make sure\ncomputer networks are regulated and\nmonitored\nhow to become a cyber security analyst\nthe first step is to earn a bachelor's\ndegree in cyber security\ni.t computer science or a related field\nthe second step is to complete an\ninternship to obtain experience or of\nhands-on training in a computer-related\nfield\nthe third step is to gain special\ncredentials by obtaining certification\nafter training\nthe fourth step is to pursue for\nentry-level positions and general i.t or\nsecurity in any organization\nwhat are the cyber security analyst job\nprospects\ncyber security analysts have excellent\njob opportunities and rewarding career\nprospects\ncyber security analysts enjoy high\nsalaries when compared with other\ncomputer and i.t professionals\nlet us now look into the top 10
