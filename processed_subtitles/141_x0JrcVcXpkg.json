  "text": "[Music]\nhello everyone\nwelcome to another exciting session on\ndata mining today\nmy name is rajan shaitri and in today's\nsession i am going to share\nmy understanding of data mining\nlet us start with the agenda first of\nall\nso initially we are going to start with\nthe introduction of what data mining\nis and we are trying to understand the\nbasics of it\nonce we understand the basics of data\nmining we'll try to understand data\nmining more in detail\nand after that we'll be understanding\nthe various application areas\nof data mining let us start\nwith the intro\nwell before we start discussing what\ndata mining is\nfirst of all let us understand the\nbasics of why we need data mining\nand how it all started so in today's\nscenario\none way of people's success is\nidentified\nby how they are communicating and\nsharing the information\nwith others that's where the concept of\nlanguage comes into the picture\nhowever there are many languages in the\nworld\neach has many standards and alphabets\nand the combination of these words\narranged meaningfully resulted in the\nformation of a sentence\neach language has its own rules while\ndeveloping these sentences\nand these set of rules are known as\ngrammar\nin today's world according to industry\nestimates only 20\nof the data is being generated in the\nstructured format as we speak\nas we tweet or as we send some messages\non whatsapp\nemail facebook instagram or whatnot\nand the majority of this data exist in\nthe textual form\nwhich is a highly unstructured format in\norder to produce\nmeaningful insights from this text data\nthere\nwe exactly need to follow something\ncalled text analysis\nnow that's where data mining comes into\nthe picture data mining is a process of\ndiscovering\npredictive information from the analysis\nof large databases\nfor a data scientist data mining can be\na vague and daunting task\nit requires a diverse set of skills and\nknowledge\nof many data mining techniques to take\nraw data\nand successfully get insights from it\nall right now as we have provided\nthe introduction to data mining first of\nall let us start with why exactly we\nneed to do data mining\nso let us answer some basic question\nhere\nsuch as why data mining\nin order to understand data mining let\nus take some use cases here\nfor example let's say credit rating\nor targeted marketing\nso what exactly this is let us suppose\nthere is a database given of let's say\nhundred thousand hundred thousand names\nwhich persons\nare the least likely to default on their\ncredit cards\nidentify likely responders to sale\npromotions\nso that is basically one of the use case\nwhere we use data mining\nthe second use case could be\nfraud detection now what exactly\nis the role played by data mining and\nfraud detection\nyou know we can answer such questions\nfor example let's say\nwhich types of transactions are likely\nto be fraudulent\ngiven the customer demographics and\ntransactional history\nof a particular customer\nthe third use case could be\ncustomer relationship management\nafter all every company wants to have\ngood relations with the customers\nwe can using data mining we can answer\nsuch questions\nfor example which of my customers are\nlikely to be the most\nloyal and which are most likely to leave\nfor a competitor now we can answer all\nthese questions\nand solve all these scenarios by using\ndata mining here now data mining helps\nextract such information\nall right so in data mining we process\nor semi-automatically we analyze large\ndatabases to find patterns\nthat are valid that are novel\nuseful and understandable\nnow this process is also known as kdt\nkdd stands for knowledge discovery\ndatabase\nnow let's talk about the applications of\ndata mining where we can exactly\nyou know implement\ndata mining techniques so the\napplications of data mining\ncan be banking\nwell let's let us understand banking in\nterms of loan\nor credit card approval you can think of\nyou know predicting good customers based\non old customers\nsecond example as i mentioned earlier\ncould be\ncustomer or relationship management\nthe use case could be identifying those\nwho are likely to leave\nfor a competitor\nthird targeted marketing\nthat we have already done\nwell i invite likely responders to the\npromotion\nand four is basically fraud detection\nwell from an online stream of events\nidentify the fraudulent\nevents as an application of data mining\nwell we can use data mining in\nmanufacturing\nand production\nwell using data mining we can\nautomatically adjust\nknobs when processes parameter changes\nwe can use data mining and healthcare as\nwell\nor in simple words we can use it in\nmedicines\nfor example for identifying the disease\noutcomes\neffectiveness of the treatment analyzing\npatients disease history\nfinding a relationship between diseases\nall these things can be done\nusing data mining well we can use\ndetermining for\nyou know scientific analysis as well\nand we can use data mining in websites\nyou know for design and promotion\nlet us understand types of data mining\nwell there are various types of data\nmining we have available\nso let us understand data mining can be\nperformed\nin the following types of data so we can\nperform\ndata mining on the data which is fetched\nfrom\na relational database\nwell if in case if you don't have any\nunderstanding of what your relational\ndatabase is\nlet me provide you with a small\ndescription here our relational database\nis a collection of multiple data sets\nformally organized by tables records and\ncolumns\nfrom which data can be accessed in\nvarious ways without having to\nrecognize the tables itself\ntable convey and share information which\nfacilitates\ndata searchability reporting and\norganization basically\nwe can think of you know performing data\nmining\non the data from data warehouses\nnow data warehouse is in itself is a\nbroader you know domain so what exactly\nis a data warehouse\na data warehouse is basically a\ntechnology that collects\nthe data from various sources within the\norganization to provide some meaningful\nbusiness insights the huge amount of\ndata which comes from multiple sources\nsuch as marketing maybe maybe finance\nyou know is extracted and utilized for\nanalytical purposes\nand help in making decisions you can\ncall it\nas a decision science as well\nreally we can you know uh do the data\nmining fetch from you know data\nrepositories\nwe can do the data mining fetch from\nobject relational databases\nand we can also you know perform the\ndata mining\nyou know from transactional databases\nwell uh there are various advantages of\nyou know uh data mining that we have\nso for example the data mining\ntechniques enables any organization\nto obtain knowledge based data the\nsecond advantage can be you know\nit enables organization to make\nliquidative modifications\nin operations and productions for\nattracting more customers\ncompared with other statistical data\napplications data mining is a cost\nefficient solution well\nif you combine every aspect of data\nmining in simple words\nit is going to help the organizations\nfor decision making\nwell it is a quick process and it is\neasy for new users to analyze\nenormous amount of data\nall right now now we have a clear\nunderstanding of what data mining\nis and what are its applications let us\nunderstand how the data mining\nis implemented the implementation of\ndata mining\nentirely relies on the kdd process\nin data mining so here we're going to\nspend some time\non understanding what this kdd process\nand data mining is\nwell i hope you remember the term kdd\nstands for\nknowledge discovery in databases\nwell volume of information is increasing\nevery day that we can handle\nfrom business transactions scientific\ndata sensor data pictures videos\nor whatnot well\nwe need a system that will be capable of\nextracting essence of information\navailable\nand that can automatically generate\nreports views\nor summary of data for better decision\nmaking\nwell data mining is used for business to\nmake\nbetter managerial decisions\nwe make better managerial decisions by\nautomatic summarization of the data by\nextracting the essence of information\nstored\nor by discovering the patterns in the\nraw data\nfor this let us understand what are the\nsteps\nsteps which are involved in the kdd\nprocess\nwell in order to understand the steps in\nkdd process let us look at the\nphases here all right\nso here you can see a pictorial\nrepresentation of how the kdd process\nis followed in data mining here we have\nvarious components here such as starting\nfrom databases\nto data warehouses then there's a data\nmining process\nand finding the patterns and pattern\nevaluation and then there is a knowledge\nhere\nso let us understand all these phases\none by one in a step-by-step manner\nso the very first phase that we are\ntalking here about is basically\nthe data cleaning so what exactly is\ndata cleaning\ndata cleaning can be defined as a\nremoval of\nnoisy and irrelevant data from your\ncollection\nwell we perform the data cleaning if in\ncase if there are any\nmissing values in the data we clean the\nnoisy data\nwhere the noise is a random or a\nvariance\nerror we do the cleaning with data\ndiscrepancy detection\nand data transformation tools\nthen the next phase is data integration\nnow data integration is defined as\nheterogeneous data\nfrom multiple sources combined in a\ncommon source\nsuch as data warehouse now\nthis data integration happens using data\nmigration tools\nuh or we can also call them data\nsynchronization tools\nwell this data integration using extract\ntransform load process is is the\nsolution\nright so we use atl process for this\ndata creation\nthen there is something called data\nselection\ndata selection and transformation right\nso\nlet us discuss the data selection first\nof all\ndata selection is defined as a process\nwhere\nthe data relevant to the analysis is\ndecided\nand retrieved from the collection or the\ndata collection you can say\nwell data selection uh can be done using\nneural networks\nit can be done you know using decision\ntrees\nnav buys or clustering or regression\netc so there are actually you know uh\ntons and tons of uh algorithms and you\nknow\ntechniques available for data selection\nwell once the data selection process is\ndone we move forward\nto the data transformation let us\nunderstand data transformation clearly\nhere\ndata transformation can be defined as a\nprocess\nof transforming data into an\nappropriate form which is required for\nthe\nmining procedure right so data\ntransformation is basically a two-step\nprocess\none is basically let's call it\ndata mapping and the second is\ncode generation well in data mapping\nwe assign elements from source\nbase to a destination to capture the\ntransformation\nwell if we talk about the code\ngeneration it is based it is simple\nit is creation of the actual\ntransformation program\nwhich is going to you know do the action\nor processing for us\nonce we have done the data selection and\ndata transformation process\nwe move to the next phase and that is\ndata mining\ndata mining as i you know explained\nearlier it is a process\nof you know of clever techniques we can\nsay right that are applied\nto extract patterns which are\npotentially useful for the businesses\nwell then we move on to\npattern evaluation pattern evolution is\nsomething which you know which is used\nfor identifying strictly\nincreasing patterns representing\nknowledge based\non measures for example we can use\nsummarization here we can use\nvisualization of the data\nto make the data understandable by the\nuser\nthen finally knowledge representation\nand\nthis knowledge representation is\nbasically the technique\nright which is used for representing\ndata or the mining results\nfor knowledge representation we can use\nvarious tools\nsuch as you know we can use tables we\ncan use reports\nwe can use you know any classification\nor characterization rules\nthere are tons and tons of processes\nall right so this is a gist of you know\nhow the kdd process\nhappens i know in a data mining process\nand the various components which are\ninvolved in it i hope you have\nunderstood the concepts clearly\nhere\nall right so as we have understood how\nto\nimplement the kdd process in data mining\nlet us understand the various techniques\nthat are used for data mining so here\nwe are trying to understand data mining\ntechniques\nthere are various techniques available\nfor implementing data mining\nhere we are going to discuss these data\nmining techniques one by one\nfirst of all let us talk about the very\npopular data mining technique\nand that is classification\nwell classification is used to retrieve\nimportant and relevant information about\ndata\nand metadata this data mining method\nhelps to classify data in different\nclasses\nthe second technique that we are\nlearning here is class clustering\nclustering is the second data mining\ntechnique\nwell clustering analysis is a data\nmining technique\nto identify data that are likely that\nare like each other\nthis process helps to understand the\ndifference and similarities between the\ndata\nthe third technique that we are talking\nhere about determining\nis regression\nwell regression analysis is the data\nmining method of identifying\nand analyzing the relationships between\nthe variables\nit is used to identify the likelihood of\na specific variable\ngiven the presence of other variables\nthe fourth technique that we are talking\nhere about\nis association rules\nnow what exactly this is this is a data\nmining technique that helps to find\nthe association between two or more\nitems\nit discovers a hidden pattern in a data\nset\nthe fifth technique here we are talking\nabout is\nouter detection\nwhat is outer detection this type of\ndata mining technique\nrefers to observation of data items\nin the data set which do not match an\nexpected pattern\nor expected behavior this technique can\nbe used in a variety of domains\nsuch as intrusion detection fraud or\nfault detection etc auto detection is\nalso\ncalled outlier analysis or outlier\nmining\nnow the next technique here we are\ntalking about is\nsequential patterns\nthis data mining technique helps to\ndiscover or identify\nsimilar patterns or trends in\ntransaction data\nfor certain period\nand the next technique here we are\ntalking about is prediction\nprediction has used a combination of\nother techniques of data mining like\ntrends sequential pattern clustering\nclassification\nbasically what it does it analyzes past\nevents or instances\nin a right sequence for predicting a\nfuture event\nwell there are various data mining\ntechniques which we can use here\nbut when we use the techniques of data\nmining there are various challenges\nwhich are associated with the\nimplementation\nfor example there are various challenges\nsuch as skilled experts\nso skills experts are needed to\nformulate the data mining queries\nthe second challenge is basically the\noverfitting\ndue to the small size training database\na model\nmay not fit future states\nthe third challenge is basically the\ndata mining needs large databases which\nsometimes are difficult to manage\nwhile business practices may need to be\nmodified to determine to use the\ninformation\nuncovered what if the data set is not\ndiverse\ndata mining results may not be accurate\nand finally the integration information\nneeded\nfrom heterogeneous databases and global\ninformation\nsystems could be complex\nnow there were the various challenges\nwhich are associated with data mining\nlet us talk about the data mining tools\nwhich we can use to implement the\ntechniques\nso there are various data mining tools\nwhich are available in the market here\nthe very popular data mining tools are\nour language\nso our language is an open source tool\nfor statistical computing\nand graphics r has a wide variety of\nstatistical classical statistical tests\ntime series analysis classification and\ngraphical techniques\nit offers effective data handling and\nstorage facility\nthe second technique is oracle data\nmining\nwell oracle data mining popularly known\nas\nodm is a module of the oracle's\nadvanced analytics database\nthis data mining tool allows data\nanalysts to generate\ndetailed insights and make predictions\nit helps predict customer behavior\ndevelop customer profiles\nidentify cross-selling opportunities\nand the third technique that we are\nthird tool that we are talking here\nabout is python\nwell python is a popular\nprogramming languages which is widely\nused for you know machine learning\nor data science implementations it has a\nwide area of\nlibraries available which can be used\nfor\nimplementing data mining\nlet us talk about a very popular\nconfusion\nor a subject which basically creates\na misunderstanding between data mining\nversus\nmachine learning\nit has been observed that many of the\nlearners\nassume that both are same let us\nunderstand\nthe difference between data mining and\nmachine learning\nwell later mining relates to extracting\ninformation\nfrom a large quantity of data data\nmining is a technique\nof discovering different kinds of\npatterns that are inherited\nin the data set and which are precise\nnew\nand useful data mining is working\nas a subset of business analytics and\nsimilar to experimental studies data\nmining's origin\nour databases and statistics whereas if\nwe talk about the machine learning\nmachine learning includes an algorithm\nthat automatically improves\nthrough database experience machine\nlearning is a way to find a new\nalgorithm from experience\nmachine learning includes the study of\nan algorithm\nthat can automatically extract the data\nmachine learning utilizes data mining\ntechniques\nand other learning algorithms to\nconstruct models\nof what is happening behind certain\ninformation\nso that it can predict future results\ndata mining and machine learning are\nareas that have been influenced\nby each other although they have many\ncommon things\nyet they have different ends\ndata mining is performed on certain data\nsets by humans\nto find interesting patterns between the\nitems in the data set\ndata mining uses techniques created by\nmachine learning\nfor creating the results while machine\nlearning\nis the capability of the computer to\nlearn\nfrom a minded data set machine learning\nalgorithms\ntakes the information that represents\nthe relationship between\nitems in a data set and creates models\nin order to predict future results these\nmodels are nothing\nmore than actions that will be taken by\nthe machine\nto achieve a result so i think\nthis you know explanation should clear\nthe difference\nbetween machine learning and\ndetermining well there are many other\ndifferences which we can discuss about\ndata mining and machine learning\nfor example let's talk about origin\nwell if we talk about origin of data\nmining\nit is from traditional databases with\nunstructured data\nif we talk about the origin of machine\nlearning here it has an\nexisting algorithm and data\nwell if we talk about the meanings of\nboth the\nterms the data mining stands about\nextracting\ninformation from a huge amount of data\nwhereas on the other side if we talk\nabout the meaning of machine learning\nit introduces new information from data\nas well as previous experience\nnew information\nfrom previous experience\nwell if we go a little back\nin the history of both the terms\nthis determining is is in existence\nsince 1930s popularly known as\nkdt whereas if we talk about the machine\nlearning\nthis was very first introduced in the\n1950s\nwell if we talk about the purpose of\nyou know both the uh\nconcepts of you know data mining and\nmachine learning data mining is used to\nobtain the rules from the\nexisting data rules\nfrom the existing data\nwhereas if you talk about the machine\nlearning here machine learning basically\nyou know\nteaches a computer a computer\nabout you know how to learn and\ncomprehend the rule\nabout how to learn\nand comprehend\nthe role\nwell if we talk about the applications\nhere\nthere are various applications of both\nthe you know domains here\nso whereas where machine data mining is\nbasically used\nfor variety of use cases let's say\nthe cluster analysis\nwhereas the machine learning can be used\nto obtain\nyou know the results from the large\namount of you know data\nwhich are very precise and accurate\nthe machine learning has its\nimplementations or applications in web\nand you know uh computers and in you\nknow in\ndesigns everywhere\nwell there are various techniques you\nknow available\nuh for data mining we have already\ndiscussed this and\nthere are other you know libraries\navailable for\nmachine learning all right so it it\nlooks like\nboth have a very good scope of you know\nimplementation for solving\nthe real world problems\nall right this time let us understand\nthe difference between data mining\nversus data warehousing\nwell we have already explained what data\nmining is here\nthis time we are going to understand\ndata warehousing more in detail\nwell data warehousing refers to the\nprocess of compiling and\norganizing data into one common database\nwhereas data mining refers to the\nprocess of extracting useful data\nfrom the database the data mining\nprocess depends\non the data compiled in the data\nwarehouse\nphase to recognize meaningful patterns\nour data warehousing is created to\nsupport management systems\na data warehouse refers to a place where\nexactly data can be stored for useful\nmining\nit is like a quick computer system with\nexceptionally huge data\nstorage capacity data from various\norganizations\nsystems are copied to the warehouse\nwhere it can be fetched\nand confirmed to delete errors here\nadvanced requests can be made against\nthe warehouse storage of data\nhow a database housing process looks\nlike basically\nwe can think of data warehousing process\nin this way\nso let us suppose here we have the\nvarious sources of data\nso here this is the source of\ndata\nnow this source of data is basically you\nknow from this source of data the data\nis basically extracted\nand transformed\nonce the data is transformed the data is\nloaded\nat the target machine or at the\ndestination or in the warehouse\nthis is how the process our data\nwarehouse looks like\ndata warehouse combines data from\nnumerous sources which ensures\nthe data quality accuracy and\nconsistency\ndata warehouses boosts system execution\nby separating\nanalytics processing from transactional\ndatabases\ndata flows into a data warehouse from\nour different databases\nour data warehouse works by sorting out\ndata into a pattern\nthat depicts the format and types of\ndata\ndata warehouses and databases both are\nrelative data systems\nbut both are made to serve different\npurposes\na data warehouse is a built to store a\nhuge amount of historical data\nand empowers fast requests over all the\ndata typically using\nolap or online analytical processing\nwhereas on the other side a database is\nmade to store current transactions and\nallow quick access to specific\ntransactions\nfor ongoing businesses processes\ncommonly known as online transaction\nprocessing\nall right here let us try to understand\nthe difference between determining and\ndata analytics\nmany of the learners have been observed\nconsidering both the same\nwell data mining and data analytics are\ncrucial steps in\nany data driven projects and are needed\nto be done\nwith perfection to ensure the project\nsuccess\nadhering to both fields closeness as\nmentioned earlier\ncan make finding the difference between\ndata mining\nand analytics quite challenging before\nwe are in the state to understand\ndo our data mining versus data analytics\ncomparison\nwe must first closely understand the two\nfields very closely\nwell we have been discussing data mining\nfor a while but let's\ngive it a quick revision here data\nmining is a deliberate and successive\ncycle of distinguishing\nand finding shorter examples and\nidentifying useful data\nin an enormous data set\nit's otherwise also called knowledge\ndiscovery in database\nwhich has been already told to all of\nyou it's been trend since\nyou know the 1990s and has been in\nexistence\nsince 1930s the improvement in computing\npro is has although allowed data mining\nto become streamlined\nand mainstream whereas on the other side\nif we talk about data analysis it is the\ninformation\nanalysis then again is a superset of\ndata mining\nwhich includes removing cleaning\nchanging\ndemonstrating the data to reveal\nsignificant\nand valuable insights that can help\ndetermine\nthe way to proceed forward and make\nchoices\npertaining to the company in question\nwell data analysis as a cycle has been\naround since the 1960s\nit has only recently come into the\nmainstream\nand has proven to be an intense\nindentable tool to any significant\nglobal players arsenal now that we know\nthe basics of data mining and data\nanalytics\nwe are positioned to pit data mining\nversus data analytics head to head\nand understand all the nuances and\ndifferences\nbetween data mining and data analytics\nwell although data mining and data\nanalytics are two different words in the\nfield of data\nthey are sometimes used in place of the\nothers\nthe usage and the meaning behind the\nterms\ndepend highly on the context and the\ncompany in question\nto set up their individual identities\nsuch that you can easily differentiate\nbetween the two you will find the\nsignificant contrasting points\nhere for example let us talk about\nthe very first point here which is data\nmining\nwell data mining is a criteria right\nit's a criteria\nthe data collection and deriving crude\nbut\nin essential insights\nso here in determining the criteria\nwhich is followed here\nis to you know it has to ensure that it\ncollects\nthe essential insights from the data\ndata analytics\nthen uses the data and crude\nhypothesis to build upon that the data\ncreate a model\nbased on the data data mining is a step\nin the process of\ndata analytics\nwell data analytics is the umbrella\nwhich deals with every step\nin the pipeline of any data-driven model\ndata mining shines its brightest when\nthe data is questioned\nis well structured meanwhile data\nanalysis\ncan be performed on any data it would\nstill be able\nto derive meaningful insights that could\nhelp in propelling\nthe corporations to even greater\nheight\nwell when we are talking about data\nmining\nit is uh you know it's it is task\noriented\nso data mining is tasked to accomplish\nthe main job to make\nthe data that is being used more usable\nwhereas data analysis is used to\nhypothesize\nand in the end culminate itself in\nproviding\nvaluable information to help in business\ndecisions\nall right so determining does not need\nany\nbias or any notion which are instilled\nbefore tackling the data whereas data\nanalysis\nis majorly used for hypothesis testing\ndata mining uses the scientific and\nmathematical models\nand methods to identify patterns or\ntrends in the data\nthat is being mined on the other hand if\nwe talk about data analysis\nit is employed to task with business\nanalytics\nproblems and derive analytical models\ndata mining usually does not depend on\nany visualizations or bar charts or\ngraphs etc\nwhereas these resolutions are the bread\nand butter\nfor data analysis without a good\nrepresentation\nof the data all the efforts which are\nput into the analysis of the data\nwould not come to fruition\nwell to give it a conclusion here you\nknow we have been seeing\nboth the terms that is data mining and\ndata analysis\nfor a long time these terms were\npalpable until the leap in the shear\npower computers\nmade it possible for anyone with a\ncomputer to jump\nin and play with the data both data\nmining\nand data analytics are crucial to be\ndone perfectly\ndue to the very nature of the two\nfollowing fields\ntheir names have been used\ninterchangeably by\nindividual business people meanwhile\nthere are also people\npresent who have appreciated the\ndifferences\nin the areas and made sure to respect\nthe boundaries of the two fields\nin whatever camp you might side with you\ncannot deny\nthe importance of both in a data-driven\nworld\nof the 21st century other thing\nset in stone is the skill set required\nfor these\nfields\nall right so let us talk about the top\ndata mining algorithms here\ndetermine algorithms are applied through\nthe algorithms behind it\nthese algorithms run on the data\nextraction softwares\nand are applied based on the business\nneed\nsome of the algorithms that are widely\nused by the organizations\nto analyze the data sets are as follows\nthe very first algorithm that we're\ndiscussing here is a very popular\nalgorithm for data mining\nthis algorithm is popularly known as\nk-means\nk-means is a popular cluster analysis\ntechnique\nwhere a group of similar items are\nclustered together\nlet us talk about the second algorithm\nthe second\nalgorithm is also widely used for data\nmining\nand this is a priori algorithm\nwell it is a frequent item set mining\ntechnique and\nassociation rules are applied to it on\ntransactional databases it will detect\nfrequent item set and highlight general\ntrends\nthe third is also very popular here and\nthis is called\nk nearest neighbor\nthis method is used for classification\nand regression analysis\nthe k-nearest neighbor is lazy learning\nwhere it stores\nthe training data and when a new\nunlabeled data comes\nit will classify the input data\nthe fourth algorithm is basically naive\nbayes\nit is a group of simple probabilistic\nclassification algorithms\nwhich assume that each data object\nfeatures are independent of the other it\nis an\napplication of bayes theorem\nand the fifth algorithm is basically add\na boost\nit is a machine learning metal gotham\nthat is used to improve\nperformance at a boost is sensitive to\nnoisy data\nand outliers\nall right so this brings us to the\nconclusion of today's session\nwell before we conclude this conclude\nthe session let us have\na quick summary of what we have\ndiscussed\nwell first of all let us start from the\ndefinition of data mining\ndetermining is all about explaining the\npast\nand predicting the future wire data\nanalysis\nwell data mining helps you extract\ninformation\nfrom huge sets of data it is a procedure\nof mining knowledge from data\nthe process of this data mining includes\nbusiness understanding data\nunderstanding data preparation\nmodeling evaluations and deployment\nwell important data mining techniques\nare classification\nclustering regression\nassociation rules auto detection\nsequential patterns and predictions\nour language and oracle data mining as\nwell\nas python these are the prominent\ndetermining tools\nand techniques well data mining\nhelps companies to get knowledge based\ninformation\nthe main drawback of data mining is that\nmany analytics software is difficult to\noperate\nand require advanced training to work on\ndata mining is used in diverse\nindustries\nsuch as communications insurance\neducation\nmanufacturing banking retail\necommerce and supermarkets\nin this video tutorial we have discussed\nthe various data mining techniques\nthat can help organizations and business\nfind\nthe most useful and relevant information\nwell this information is used to create\nmodels that will predict\nthe behavior of customers\nfor the businesses to act on it\nby you know understanding all the\ninformation that we have delivered in\nthis session about the data\nmining techniques one can determine its\ncredibility\nand feasibility even better data\nextraction techniques\ninclude working with data reformatting\nrestructuring\nand you know the various processings\nwhich are followed during the kdd\nprocess\nwell finally all these techniques that\nwe have discussed on the methods in data\nmining systems help\nin the discovery of new creative\ninnovations\nwell that's all that's all for today\neveryone\nso with this i would like to conclude\nthe session and\na big thumbs up to you for watching the\nvideo till here\nif you liked the video please do not\nforget to hit the like button\npress the subscribe
