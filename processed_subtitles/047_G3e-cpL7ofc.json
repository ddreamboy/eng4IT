  "text": "Welcome to the complete HTML\nand CSS course. In this course,\nwe're going to learn how to build\nwebsites from a beginner to a professional\nlevel, and by the end of this course,\nwe're going to build youtube.com.\nNow you don't need any previous\ncoding or technical experience.\nThis course is designed to be your first\nstep to becoming a software engineer.\nWe're going to start from the very basics\nof HTML and CSS and build our way up\nstep by step. And along the way,\nwe're going to learn all the major skills\nthat we need to create websites at a\nprofessional level.\nYou can find the different sections of\nthis course below the video here and\nhere. And after each section,\nI'm going to give you a bunch of\nexercises that you can do on your own to\npractice the skills that\nwe learned in total.\nThis course is going to have\nmore than 100 exercises. Lastly,\nyou don't have to worry\nabout taking notes.\nI created an HTML and CSS reference that\nwill list everything that we learned in\nthis course. With that\nsaid, let's get started.\nI am going to be doing\nthis course on a Mac,\nbut everything is the same for a\nWindows computer. Before we begin,\nwe're going to need two pieces of\nsoftware, a web browser and a code editor.\nA web browser lets us view\nwebsites on the internet.\nIt's also going to let us view the\nwebsite that we create in this course.\nThe most popular web browser for\nweb development is Google Chrome.\nA code editor helps us\nwrite our HTML and CSS code.\nThe most popular code editor for\nweb development is called VS.\nCode or Visual Studio Code.\nTo install both of these,\nwe can go to google.com\nand then search for Google\nChrome or for VS code and then\nopen the first result and follow the\ninstructions to download and install.\nOnce we have those two installed,\nwe can start the course.\nWe'll begin by learning what is html.\nHTML stands for\nhypertext markup language. You don't\nhave to worry about what that means.\nJust know that it's a tool\nthat we use to create websites.\nEvery website from YouTube to Google\nto Amazon uses a combination of\nHTML and CSS to create everything\nthat we see on the website.\nThe easiest way to\nunderstand what HTML is,\nis that we're simply giving\ninstructions to a computer.\nWe're telling the computer\nwhat to do step by step.\nThe computer will then follow our\ninstructions to create our website.\nSo I find the best way to learn HTML\nis to jump in and give it a try.\nSo we're going to create our first\nHTML file and our first website.\nLet's go to our computer and we're\ngoing to create a new folder.\nSo this folder is going to contain\nall the code for this course.\nI'm going to call this\nHTML dash CSS dash course.\nNext, we're going to open this\nfolder in our code editor.\nSo I'm going to open vs code,\nand then I'm going to click file open\nand I'm going to find the folder that\nwe just created, which is this one.\nNow once that's open,\nyou should see the folder name at\nthe top here and on the side here.\nNow let's create our first HTML file.\nWe're going to click this icon to create\na new file and we're going to call this\nfile website dot html.\nSo we have to make sure that\nthis file ends with html.\nThis tells a computer that this file\ncontains HTML code rather than just text.\nSo as I mentioned, HTML is basically some\ninstructions you give to the computer.\nWe're going to learn\nour first instruction,\nwhich is less than button greater\nthan, and we also need to type\nlesson slash button greater than,\nbut our code editor might\nauto complete this for us.\nSo this is an instruction to create\na button and inside the button we're\ngoing to have the text. Hello.\nNow let's save our file and we're going\nto learn how to open this in our web\nbrowser. To open our new website,\nwe're going to go to the\nfolder that contains our code.\nWe're going to find our HTML file.\nWe're going to right click\nopen with Google Chrome.\nAnd now you can see that we have our first\nwebsite that has a button with a text\nHello inside. And if we\nlook back to our code,\nthat's exactly the instruction that we\ngave to the computer. So as you can see,\nHTML is pretty straightforward. It's\npretty easy to understand what's going on.\nNow let's try another instruction. We\ncan give to the computer on a new line.\nWe're going to type less\nthan P, greater than,\nand we also need to type less\nthan slash p greater than,\nand our code editor might\nauto complete this for us too.\nSo the P here stands for a paragraph.\nThis is a paragraph of text.\nInside our paragraph,\nwe can put some text.\nSo let's put the text paragraph of text.\nNow we can save this and to get our\nwebsite to reflect our most current code,\nwe're going to go to our webpage and\nrefresh. And now you can see that our\nwebsite is displaying a paragraph of text\njust like we told the computer to do.\nSo that's basically how HTML works.\nThe computer reads our HTML\ncode from top to bottom and then\nfollows those instructions and\ncreates a button and a paragraph\nof text.\nIf we reverse the order of\nthese lines, for example,\nif I put the paragraph up\nhere and I save it and refresh\nthe page, then the paragraph\nwill appear on top because again,\nthe computer is just following\nour instructions one by one.\nNow I'm going to introduce\nsome terminology.\nSo each of these things\nthat we're displaying on the\nwebpage is called an HTML\nelement.\nSo a button is a type of HTML element\nand a paragraph is another type of\nHTML element.\nSo element is just a generic term that\nwe use to describe anything that we can\ndisplay on the webpage,\nand we're going to be using this term\nelement throughout this course. So now I\nwant to explain why we have to write all\nof these symbols that's less than this,\ngreater than, and this less than\nslash This is something called syntax.\nSyntax are the rules for how a coding\nlanguage like HTML should be written.\nIf you think of a language like English,\nwe have something called grammar,\nwhich is the rules of the language.\nSyntax is basically the same thing\nexcept for coding languages. Now,\nthe biggest difference between a language\nlike English and a coding language is\nthat in English, you don't have to\nfollow the rules of grammar perfectly.\nPeople can still understand\nyou, but in a coding language,\nif you don't follow the rules of syntax,\nthe computer won't understand\nyour code. For example,\nlet's break the rules of syntax by\ndeleting this greater than symbol,\nand now we're going to save our file\nand we're going to go to our website and\nrefresh. And now you notice\nthat our button is gone,\nand that's because we're not\nfollowing the proper syntax.\nSo the computer doesn't\nunderstand our HTML code anymore.\nSo let's put that greater design back\nso that we're following the proper rules\nof syntax and we don't need this.\nSo let's save and refresh our page.\nAnd now our button is back because\nwe're following the rules of syntax.\nSo what exactly are the\nsyntax rules for H T M L?\nSo this part of the code\nis called an H T M L tag.\nIt basically tells a computer\nwhat we're trying to create.\nWe write a tag by writing the less\nthan symbol. This is the tag name,\nwhich tells a computer what kind\nof element we're trying to create,\nand then the greater then symbol.\nSo every element consists of\ntwo tags in opening tag and a\nclosing tag. The closing tag\nis the same as the opening tag,\nexcept it has a slash in\nfront of the tag name.\nThat's how you can tell\nit is a closing tag.\nYou can think of the opening tag as the\nstart of the button and the closing tag\nas the end of the button.\nAnd then in between is a content\nor the text inside the button.\nAnd the same thing for the paragraph.\nThe paragraph has an opening tag,\na closing tag, and some\ncontent inside the paragraph.\nSo as long as we follow\nthese syntax rules for html,\nwe have an opening tag and a closing tag,\nand the closing tag starts with\na slash in front of the tag name.\nThen our computer will know what to do\nand display our elements on our webpage.\nThe next element that we're going to\nlearn is a link to another website. For\nexample, if we go to Google and\nwe search for something on Google,\nit will give us a bunch of links\nand when we click these links,\nit will take us to another website.\nSo we're going to learn how\nto do that in our HTML code.\nSo we'll go back to our website here\nand in our code we're going to type less\nthan a greater than.\nSo this A here represents\nan anchor element.\nAn anchor is basically a\nlink to another website.\nSo inside this anchor we're going\nto put the text of our link.\nSo let's put the text as link to YouTube.\nWe're going to save this and the\nrefresh, and now we have a link,\nbut if we click this, it doesn't\nactually take us to YouTube,\nand that's because we haven't told the\ncomputer where this link is supposed to\ntake us. Right now we just have\na link without a destination.\nSo to set a website to link to,\nwe have to learn a little\nbit more HTML syntax.\nSo we're going to go into the opening\ntag and we're going to type space\nHREF equals double quotes, double quotes.\nSo inside these quotes we're going to\ncopy and paste YouTube's website url.\nSo to get that we can go to our\nwebpage and then type in youtube.com.\nAnd at the top here we have the url.\nSo we're going to copy this\nand paste this into our quotes.\nAnd now we're going to save our file.\nWe're going to go back to\nour website and refresh.\nAnd now we have a link that we can\nclick. So when we click this link,\nit's now going to take us to youtube.com.\nSo that's how we create a link\nto another website with html.\nNow let's go back here and\nexplain what this syntax means.\nSo this is called an HTML attribute.\nAn attribute basically modifies how\nan element behaves. In this example,\nwe are using the href attribute and it\ndetermines where this link element will\ntake us When we click it right\nnow it's going to youtube.com,\nbut if we change this, it will\ntake us to a different website.\nSo this attribute is modifying\nhow the link element behaves.\nSo the syntax rules for an attribute\nare we have to have a space between the\nattribute and the tag name.\nOtherwise, if I write href here,\nthe browser is just going to think\nthat this whole thing is a tag name.\nSo that's why we have to have a space.\nSo then we're going to have an\nequal sign and double quotes.\nSo the text to the left of the equal\nsign is known as the attributes name,\nand on the right side is the value.\nThe value must be surrounded by\ndouble quotes as you can see here. So\nyou can kind of think of it like this.\nThe name tells us what we're modifying.\nThe value tells us what\nwe are modifying it to.\nSo the H tells us we're modifying the\ndestination of this link and we're\nmodifying it to youtube.com.\nWe can also have multiple attributes\non an element to add another attribute,\nwe just separated with a space like this,\nand now we're going to add another\nattribute to our link element,\nand this one is called target.\nSo the target attribute determines whether\nthis link opens in the current page\nor in a new tab. So by default, if\nwe don't have a target attribute,\nit opens in the current page like this.\nBut if we set the target\nattribute to underscore blank,\nnow this link element\nwill open in a new tab.\nSo let's go to our webpage and\nrefresh and click this link.\nYouTube will now open in a new tab.\nSo by using attributes we\ncan modify different parts\nof this element's behavior.\nThe H RF attribute modifies where this\nlink goes and the target attribute\nmodifies whether this link opens in\na new tab or in the current page.\nKeep in mind that the h r and target\nattributes only work on the link element.\nThe button and the paragraph elements\nhave their own set of attributes that we\ncan modify, and we're going to learn\nthese later on in the course. But for now,\nI just wanted to introduce you to the\nidea of using attributes to modify our\nHTML elements.\nThe last thing we're going to learn in\nthis lesson is some weird quirks of the\nHTML syntax.\nSo something that a lot of beginners\nhave trouble with is that in html,\nif you have multiple spaces\nlike this, for example,\nif we save this file and we reload,\nyou'll notice that all of these spaces\njust appear as one space on the website,\nand that's because\naccording to the syntax,\nextra spaces are essentially ignored.\nSo beginners usually have trouble\nwith this because for example,\nif they want to add space between\nthis button and this link,\nthey would start adding spaces in\nfront of the link thinking that it will\nmove it away from the button. So\nif we save this and we refresh,\nnothing happens.\nAnd that's because all of these spaces\nare essentially ignored in html.\nSo later in the course, we're going to\nlearn how to deal with these situations,\nbut for now, just keep this in mind.\nSo let's get rid of these\nextra spaces for now.\nAnd another weird quirk of the\nsyntax rule is that if I put my\ncursor here and I press enter to create\na new line and I put my cursor here,\nagain, these new lines\nalso count as spaces,\nso the browser essentially ignores them.\nIf I save the file and reload, you'll see\nthat the new line doesn't do anything.\nSo this actually makes organizing\nour HTML code very flexible.\nFor example,\nif I wanted some more space between these\nelements so that it's easier to read\nin my code,\nI can just add as much spaces as I\nwant and it won't get reflected in the\nwebsite because extra spaces like\nthese new lines are just ignored.\nA lot of people like to put the content\nof the element on its own line like this\nso that the tags basically align\nwith each other in the same column.\nAnd same thing for here. You'll\nnotice that this line is really long.\nWe can actually add new lines here\nto make our code easier to read.\nSo when we organize our code like this,\nwe generally indent or add spaces in\nfront of these lines. This helps us\nclearly tell the difference between\nthe elements, tags and its contents.\nIf we didn't have this indenting,\nthen it's pretty hard to tell where\nthis element starts and where it ends,\nespecially when we have a lot of code.\nNow your indents might look\na little different from mine.\nIt might look something like this\nwhere you have more spaces than I do.\nThis happens because by default vs.\nCode uses four spaces per indent.\nGenerally in HTML and css,\nwe use two spaces per indent.\nTo update this,\nwe're going to go down to this bottom\ntoolbar and click this section,\nand then we're going to\nclick indent using spaces,\nand we'll change this from four to two.\nSo now this file is going to\nuse two spaces per indent,\nso we can get rid of this and\npress tab to have proper indenting.\nNow that only affects\nit for the current file.\nWe can change it for every file going\nforward by going to the bottom left here\nand clicking this icon and\nthen going into settings.\nAnd in here we're going\nto search for tab size,\nand I'm going to scroll down and we'll\nchange the tab size from four to two.\nAll right, so we just learned the\nbasics of html, how to write HTML code,\nand then turn that into a website.\nWe also learned how to write HTML\nattributes which modify the behavior of an\nelement, and we learned about syntax,\nwhich are the rules that we had\nto follow when writing our code.\nHere are some exercises that you can try\non your own to practice what we learned\nin this lesson. Feel free to pause\nthe video here if you need to.\nYou can find these solutions as well\nas more exercises on my website.\nSuper simple.dev. The\nlink is below the video.\nIn this lesson,\nwe're going to learn CSS or cascading\nstyle sheets based on the name.\nIt's used to style our webpage,\nso it's used to change the\nappearance of our H C M L elements.\nSo I've actually prepared a project\nthat we can do in this lesson.\nSo we're going to open this\nproject by going to super\nsimple.dev/exercises/buttons.\nSo on this webpage I have some really\nnice looking buttons from famous websites,\nnamely YouTube and Twitter that we\ncan copy and practice our CSS with.\nSo we're going to go into our code and\nwe're actually going to create a new file\nfor this exercise.\nSo let's create a new file\nand let's call it buttons dot\nhtml.\nAnd we're going to open our\nnew HTML file in our browser.\nSo that's open the folder\nthat contains our code.\nWe're going to right click\nopen with Google Chrome.\nAnd now I'm going to set this up by\nmoving our reference design to the\nbottom like this so that it's\neasier for us to copy it with css.\nI'm just going to move that to the\ncorner and then we can work here.\nSo first, let's work on\ncreating the subscribe button.\nSo just like we learned before, we're\ngoing to create a button using H T M L,\nso less than button, greater than,\nand then insider button. We're\ngoing to have the text subscribe.\nAnd now let's save and refresh our\npage. And now we have our button.\nNext we're going to start changing the\nappearance of this button so that it\nlooks like the subscribe\nbutton from YouTube.\nLet's go into our code and we're going\nto start writing some CSS to change the\nappearance of this H T M L\nelement. So to write css,\nwe have to create a new\nelement called a style element.\nSo this style element is unique in that\nit doesn't appear visibly on the page.\nSo for example, if we save our\nfile and then we reload the page,\nthe style element doesn't\nactually create anything.\nSo the purpose of this element is that\ninside this element we can write CSS code\nwhich modifies the appearance\nof other elements. For example,\nlet's write our first bit of CSS\ncode. We're going to type button\nopen squiggly bracket,\nclose squiggly bracket.\nAnd then inside these brackets,\nwe're basically going to give instructions\nto the computer on how to modify the\nappearance. For example,\nwe can set the background dash color\nred and semicolon.\nSo make sure that you write this out\nexactly as I have it here so that we're\nfollowing the syntax rules for css.\nSo let's save this file\nand refresh our page.\nAnd now you can see that we set the\nbackground color of the button to red.\nSo as you can see, c s\ns is similar to H T M L.\nWe're simply giving instructions to the\ncomputer and then the computer follows\nour instructions step by step.\nAnd just like H T M L,\nwe have to follow certain syntax\nrules when writing our CSS so that\nthe computer understands our code.\nSo what are the syntax rules for\ncss? How does this code work?\nSo the word at the front here\nis called a CSS selector.\nIt tells a computer which elements on\nthe page we are targeting with our CSS\ncode. In this case,\nwe are targeting all buttons on the\npage and we're going to change the\nbackground color of all\nbuttons on the page to red.\nNow, inside these brackets, there are\nother rules that we have to follow.\nThe text to the left of this\ncolon is called the CSS property.\nIt tells a computer what we are\nchanging to the right of the colon\nis the CSS value. It tells a computer\nwhat we're changing the property to.\nIn this case, we're changing the\nproperty background color to red,\nand that's exactly what the computer did.\nThe colon is here to just separate the\nproperty and the value and the\nsemicolon here is just like a period in\nEnglish. In English, you end\nsentences with a period in css,\nyou end a style with a semicolon.\nSo that's what all of this syntax means.\nSo we can actually add multiple\nstyles inside these brackets.\nSo let's go ahead and add another style.\nWe're going to change the text\ncolor to white to match this design.\nSo the property for changing\nthe text color is called color.\nSo notice that it's not called text color,\nit's just something that\nwe have to remember.\nWe're going to change it to white\nand we'll end it with as semicolon.\nLet's save and refresh.\nAnd now you can see that we change the\ntext color of this button to white.\nAnd that's basically how c s s works.\nWe tell the computer what we're targeting\nand then we give some styles and the\ncomputer is going to apply\nthese styles one by one.\nSo let's do another example. This\ntime we'll set the border property.\nSo notice that our button has a border\nwhile the subscribe button here doesn't\nhave a border. So we're going\nto set the border property\ncolon two, none,\nand we're going to save\nthis file and refresh.\nAnd now we just remove the border.\nSo if you look at our styles here,\nit's actually pretty straightforward.\nThey're pretty easy to read.\nWe set the background color to red,\ntext color to white and border to none.\nSo just like html, CSS is\npretty straightforward.\nWe're essentially just giving\nthe computer instructions.\nSo the general technique for going\nfrom something that looks like this to\nsomething that looks like this is to\njust change these styles one by one.\nSo we're going to continue changing\nstyles one by one until we get our design\nhere.\nThe next style I'm going to change is\nthe height. So our button's a little bit\nshort, I'm going to make it taller.\nSo I'm going to set the height\nto something like 50 px.\nThe PX here represents pixels.\nPixels are a very common unit of\nmeasurement in the digital world,\nimage sizes are measured in pixels,\nvideo sizes are measured in pixels,\nand your screen sizes also\nmeasured in pixels. In this case,\nwe're going to set the\nbutton high, two 50 pixels.\nAnd don't worry too much about\nknowing what 50 pixels looks like.\nThe more that you write\nCSS and work with pixels,\nthe more you get a sense for how big\nthese measurements turn out to be.\nSo for now, let's save this\nfile and refresh the page.\nAnd now we have a button\nthat is 50 pixels tall,\nbut it actually looks like\nit's a little too tall.\nSo I'm going to change the heights\nto something like 30 pixels,\nand I'm going to refresh the page again,\nand I actually want it to\nbe a little bit taller,\nso I'm going to change it to maybe 36.\nI'm going to\nrefresh and I think that\nlooks pretty good to me.\nSo you see that in css.\nWe do a lot of trial and error\nto get our measurements right\nNow let's keep working step by\nstep to get to our design. Next,\nwe're going to adjust the width.\nSo let's change this to\nsomething like a hundred pixels.\nLet's see how that looks.\nI'm going to save it refresh,\nand I think it looks a\nlittle bit too small,\nso I'm going to increase\nit just a little bit. 1 0 5\nand refresh. Okay, I think\nthat looks good enough for me.\nNext we're going to change the background\ncolor because currently our red is not\nthe same as our design.\nSo VS code has a really nice\nfeature which is a color picker.\nSo if we hover over this color box here,\nit gives us access to a color picker\nthat we can pick another color with.\nSo I'm going to pick something that's\na little closer to what I see at the\nbottom, and don't worry, it\ndoesn't have to be perfect.\nI'm going to pick something like 200 0 0.\nI'm going to save this and refresh. Okay,\nso I think that looks close enough.\nSo you might be wondering\nwhat this value means.\nWe went from a color of red to RGB\n200 0 0.\nSo this RGB value is another\nway of measuring color.\nIt's a more precise way of measuring\ncolor than just using a word like red or\nwhite.\nSo the way that RGB works is that pretty\nmuch every color can be created using a\ncombination of red, green, and blue.\nSo that's what this syntax represents.\nThe R represents how much\nred we have in this color.\nG represents how much green\nand B represents how much blue.\nAnd these three numbers represent\nhow much red we have, how much green,\nand how much blue. The minimum value\nis zero and the maximum value is\n255.\nSo if we removed all the red and\ngreen and we just have maximum blue\nand we save, that's going\nto get us a blue color.\nOn the other hand, if we have all\ngreen color and we get rid of the blue,\nwe're going to have a green color.\nSo this is basically how RGB works.\nIt's a combination of red, green, and\nblue to create any color that we want.\nNow, don't worry too much about\nknowing what an RGB value looks like.\nFor example, if you have a random value\nlike this, if you gave this to me,\nI wouldn't even know what this color was.\nUsually I just use the color picker to\npick the color that I want and then it\nwill give me the RGB value that I need.\nThe only RGB values I suggest\nyou remember are if we set\nall the colors to the\nmaximum value. So 2 55, 2 55,\nand 2 55, this creates white.\nSo we save it and refresh\nthat creates white.\nIf we set all of these three to zero,\nthat creates black and we refresh,\nthat creates a black color.\nSo now let's go back\nto what we had before,\nwhich I think was 200 0 0,\nand we'll save and refresh.\nAnd the next thing we're\ngoing to change is here.\nWe might not be able to see\nit, but if we zoom in here,\nthis button has rounded corners\nwhile our button has pointy corners.\nSo to make rounded corners,\nthe CSS property for doing that is border\ndash radius, and the border\nradius takes a pixel measurement.\nThe higher the pixels, the more round\nthe corners will be. So for now,\nlet's try colon two pixels and save.\nNow if we refresh the page,\nour button now has rounded\ncorners just like our design.\nSo I'm going to zoom back\nout and zoom back out.\nSo the last thing I'm going to change\nis if we hover over this button,\nyou'll notice that our mouse\nturns into this sort of hand.\nThis hand is called a pointer.\nSo we're going to change\nthe cursor, the mouse.\nThis thing that you point around\nis usually called the cursor,\nand we're going to change\nthe cursor to a pointer.\nLet's save and refresh.\nAnd that's how you get this hand\nwhenever your mouse is over this button.\nSo that's basically how we go from a\nbasic HTML button to something that\nlooks more professional. We\ncreate the button with html,\nand then we set the styles one by\none. Now you might be wondering,\nhow do I know all of these CSS properties?\nHow are you supposed to\nmemorize all of these?\nSo usually when I don't know the CSS\nproperty for something, for example,\nif I want to create rounded corners,\nI would go to Google and search\nsomething like CSS and what I\nwant to do, so let's say\nI want round corners,\nand usually the first few links\ngive some really good suggestions\non what the property is. So here,\nright away we have the border radius\nproperty in the first link and it gives\nus some sample code that we can use.\nSo that's how I discover\nall of the CSS properties.\nI look at a design and I ask myself, okay,\nwhat do I need to achieve this design?\nAnd then I search for it in Google.\nSo don't worry. As you\nuse CSS more and more,\nyou're going to have to Google things\nthat you don't know and you're just get\nused to the process of finding\nanswers by searching for them.\nBut for the purposes of this course,\nI'm going to give you a lot of these\nCSS properties so that you can get some\ngood practice with them.\nThe next step we're going to\ndo is to copy this join button.\nSo let's create a new button\non our page with html,\nand this is going to be the join button.\nSo we're going to put the\ntext join inside this button,\nlet's save it and refresh.\nAnd unfortunately,\nit looks like our join button\nlooks like the subscribe button,\nand that's because in our C s s,\nthis word button means that all\nof these styles are targeted\nto all buttons on the page.\nSo how do we get these styles to\nonly target the subscribe button?\nSo we're going to learn a new HTML\nattribute that we can use for this.\nSo remember in the previous lesson\nwe learned that attributes modify the\nbehavior of elements. In this lesson,\nwe're going to learn a very useful\nattribute that is used a lot in css.\nWe're going to go to\nthe opening tag again,\nand we're going to add a new\nattribute called the class attribute.\nSo we're going to type\nclass equals quotes. Quotes.\nSo the class attribute basically\nlets us label HTML elements.\nFor example, let's label this\nbutton the subscribe button.\nAnd also my code is getting\na little long for this line,\nso I'm going to put the text on a\nnew line to make it easier to read.\nSo remember, according to HTML syntax,\nthese extra spaces don't matter.\nThey're ignored. So now that\nwe set the class attribute,\nwe've essentially set a label to this\nbutton and we can target this label in\nour css. So to target a class in css,\nwe can start with a dot, and then\nwe're going to type out the class name.\nSo we're going to type\nout subscribe dash button.\nSo according to CSS syntax, if\nwe start this code with a dot,\nthat means we're going to target a class\nname instead of an element name like\nbutton.\nSo here we're going to start targeting\njust any element that has the class\nsubscribe button.\nSo if we save and refresh now\nyou'll see that all of these\nstyles only apply to elements\nthat have the class subscribe,\nand our join button does not\nhave any of these styles. Now,\nmultiple elements can have these\nsame class. So for example,\nif I set the class of the join\nbutton to subscribe dash button,\nall these styles will be applied to any\nelement with the subscribe button class.\nThat's what this dot means.\nAnd that means these are going\nto be applied to this and this.\nSo if we save and refresh,\nnow the join button has these styles\nagain because it has a class of subscribe\nbutton. But for our purposes,\nwe actually want this to have\na different set of styles.\nSo let's give a different\nclass to the join button.\nWe're going to give the class join,\nand I'm also going to reformat my code\na little to make it easier to read.\nSo let's save and refresh.\nAnd now we're back to where we can\nstart modifying our join button.\nNow let's start styling our join button\nto match our design. So remember,\nthe general strategy is to create\nthe element with HTML like this and\nthen style it one by one\nuntil you match your design.\nSo first we're going to target the\nclass. That's what this dot means.\nWe're going to target the\nclass join dash button. Okay,\nso let's set the background\ndash color to white.\nLet's save it and refresh. And next,\nlet's deal with the border.\nSo our border is a little bit gray.\nWe can set it to maybe\nborder dash color to\nblue, and let's see how that\nlooks. Let's save it and refresh.\nOkay, so it looks a little darker\nthan what we have in our design.\nLet's go into our color picker\nand pick a more accurate color.\nSo I'm just going to do this by eye.\nDon't worry if it's not totally accurate.\nWe're just trying to get\nsomething that's close enough.\nI'm going to go over here and\nI'm going to pick something like\nmaybe something like this.\nLet's save it refresh,\nand that's a little bit too dark.\nSo I'm going to pick something\na little bit lighter,\nsave it and refresh. Okay,\nI think that's pretty good. But we\nalso noticed that our border's a little\nweird. So on the top it looks like it's\na darker, it's a lighter shade of blue,\nand at the bottom it's kind of a\ndarker shade of blue. So to fix that,\nwe're going to set the border style to be\na solid color.\nLet's save this and refresh.\nAnd now we get a solid color all around.\nThe next thing we can change is our border\nlooks a little bit thick compared to\nthe design, so we're going to\nchange the border dash width.\nSo you'll see that a lot of these\nstyles are pretty self-explanatory.\nSo we're going to set the border\nwidth to let's say one pixel.\nLet's save it and refresh.\nOkay, so that looks pretty good.\nNext we're going to set the tex color.\nSo we're going to set the tex color to\nblue and have it the same as our border.\nSo remember, the property to set\nTex color is called color colon,\nand we're going to copy\nthis color down here,\nsave it and refresh. Okay, so that looks,\nit's a little light,\nbut I think it's okay.\nNow we're going to set\nthe height and the width.\nSo let's set the height to be\nsomething like 36 pixels to\nmatch our subscribe button\nrefresh. Okay, and now we're\ngoing to set the width.\nSo let's try, I don't know, 60 pixels.\nLet's see how that looks.\nSave and refresh. Okay,\nI'm going to set it to maybe 62.\nOkay, let's save and refresh. And again,\nwe're going to set some rounded corners.\nSo that is border dash radius,\ntwo pixels. We're going\nto save it and refresh.\nAnd now we're almost there\nto matching this design.\nThe last one we're going to set is\ncursor pointer to get that nice hand\npointer when we're\nhovering over the button.\nSo refresh now when we're\nhovering over the join button,\nwe have this nice pointer icon.\nSo another thing we notice is that\nthere's a lot of space between these two\nbuttons and there's not a\nlot of space between ours.\nSo in CSS space is called\nmargin. So to add space,\nwe're going to add some margin. So\nlet's go to the subscribe button styles.\nAnd we're going to add\nsome margin dash, right?\nSo we're going to add some margin or\nsome space to the right of this button.\nAnd we're going to set this\nspace to maybe eight pixels.\nLet's see how that\nlooks. Save and refresh,\nand that looks pretty good to me. So\nnow we're done with the join button.\nLastly, we're going to create this tweet\nbutton. Let's go back into our code.\nAnd remember, our general\ntechnique is to number one,\ncreate the element with\nhtml, and then number two,\nstyle it with CSS one by one.\nSo we're going to create\na button with a text\ntweet. I'm going to move my editor a\nlittle bit to the right here so we can see\nit. I'll move this here as well.\nAnd let's refresh your page.\nSo now this button has the same style\nas a join button because it has a join\nbutton class, and that's\nbeing targeted up here.\nSo instead of the join button,\nwe're going to give a class\nor a label of tweet button.\nNow save and refresh. And now\nwe're back to the default styles.\nSo in our css, we're going to write some\ncode. We're going to target the class.\nSo we start with a dot. To target a class,\nwe're going to target\nthe tweet button class.\nSo just like our other buttons,\nwe're going to adjust the style of this\nbutton one by one until we match our\ndesign. So let's start off\nwith the background dash color.\nThat set us to blue to start off with.\nNow I'm going to try my best to match\nthe Twitter blue that we have here.\nSo I'm going to pick something like this,\nand I think that looks pretty good.\nSave it and refresh. Okay,\nwe'll leave it like that for\nnow. We might adjust it later.\nLet's change the color now to white.\nSo that'll change the text color. Okay,\nlet's get rid of the border\nrefresh and save.\nLet's give it a height of 36\npixels to match our other buttons.\nAnd the color's a little bit off, so\nI'm going to adjust it just a bit.\nMaybe it should be a\nlittle more like this.\nSave it refresh. Okay, I'm\npretty happy with this.\nNow we're going to\nadjust the width to maybe\n105. Let's see how that looks.\nOkay, that's a little too\nmuch. Let's adjust it to 80.\nLet's adjust it to 70. So as you can see,\nthere's a lot of trial and error\nwhen we're working with c s s. Now,\nto get this rounded effect,\nwe can set a border radius.\nLet's start with two pixels. If we\nrefresh, we get rounded corners.\nIf we start increasing the pixels for the\nborder radius, let's save and refresh.\nIt starts getting rounder and rounder.\nSo the trick to getting these\nround buttons is we have\nto set the border radius\nto half the height or the width,\nwhichever is lower. So in this case,\nthe height is 36. If we set the borderer\nradius to half of that, which is 18,\nsave and refresh. That's how\nwe get this rounded color.\nThe last thing we're going to\ndo is to bold the text in here.\nSo in our design, this tweet\ntext here is very bold,\nso we're going to make our\nfont bold as well. So do that.\nWe're going to set this\nproperty called font dash. Wait,\nI'm going to set it to\nbold save and refresh.\nOkay, looks pretty good.\nIt looks like this font is\nactually a little bigger than ours.\nSo let's actually set the font dash size,\nset it to maybe 15, see how that looks,\nsave and refresh. Okay, I\nthink that looks pretty close.\nI'm going to change the width to maybe 74.\nSee how that looks? Okay, so\nI think this is good enough.\nCurrently we're just trying\nto copy things by eye. Later.\nI'll show you a technique of how to copy\nthese colors and measurements exactly,\nbut for now,\nit's good enough to be able to achieve\nthese designs just by looking at them.\nSo the last thing for this button\nis to add the cursor pointer.\nLet's save it and refresh. So\nif we hover over this button,\nwe now get a nice pointer for our cursor.\nSo the last thing I'm going to adjust\nhere is the spacing between\nthese two buttons. Remember,\nspacing and CSS is called margin.\nSo we're going to add to\nthe join button. Actually,\nlet's add it to the tweet button just\nfor practice. We're going to add spacing.\nSo we're going to add margin\nto the left colon,\nand let's make it eight pixels like\nwe had it for the subscribe button.\nLet's save it and\nrefresh. And there we go.\nSo we took our basic buttons and we\nwere able to copy these really nice\nlooking designs just by looking at them.\nAnd the technique that we use for doing\nthis is first we create the element with\nhtml,\nand then we style it with CSS one by\none until it looks close enough to\nour design.\nSo here are a bunch of exercises from\nother popular websites that you can try\nout for yourself.\nThis is a good challenge for you to be\nable to look at a website by I and use\nCSS to copy the styles that you see.\nIn this lesson, we're going to\nlearn some intermediate CSS skills,\nsuch as how to create hovers,\ntransitions and shadows.\nFor most buttons you see on the internet,\nif we hover over them with our mouse,\nthey change their style slightly,\nsome of them get darker,\nsome of them get lighter. We're going\nto learn how to do that in our code.\nSo we're going to use the same\nexercise as before. As a reminder,\nyou can find it at super\nsimple.dev/exercises/buttons.\nThese buttons, when we hover over\nthem, they actually change their style.\nSo this is going to help us practice\nlearning about hovers. In addition,\nyou'll notice that if we hover in and out,\nthey change their style smoothly so\nwe can also learn about transitions.\nAnd lastly, this tweet\nbutton, if we hover over it,\nit casts a little bit of a shadow,\nso that'll help us practice shadows.\nBut first, let's work on the hover\nstyles for the subscriber button.\nLet's go into our code and find the\nstyles for the subscribe button,\nwhich is everything here. And\nnow to create a hover effect,\nwe're going to create a new block of css.\nWe're going to use a.to target a class.\nSo this time we're still targeting\nthe subscribe dash button,\nbut this time we're going to\nadd colon hover, open bracket,\nclose bracket.\nSo inside these are styles that will\napply only when we hover over the button.\nThat's what this colon\nhover means. For example,\nwe can set the background\ndash color two green.\nNow let's save our file\nand refresh the page.\nAnd when we hover over this button,\nyou'll notice that it's green.\nSo the way that this works is\nthat if we are not hovering over,\nall of these styles apply. So\nthe background color is red.\nIf we are hovering over the button,\nthese styles now apply in\naddition to these styles.\nSo we're essentially adding\nextra styles when we hover.\nSo this colon hover is\nknown as a pseudo class.\nIt basically adds extra styles in a\ncertain situation. So in this case,\nit's going to add extra\nstyles when we hover.\nAnother example of a pseudo\nclass is dot subscribe button\ncolon active.\nSo the active pseudo class activates\nwhen we click on the element.\nSo when we click on the button, we can\nset the background dash color to blue.\nLet's save this and refresh.\nNow when we hover over,\nwe're going to apply these styles. So the\nbackground color is going to be green,\nand then when we click, we're\ngoing to apply the active styles,\nand then the background\ncolor is going to be blue.\nSo let's look at our design and see\nwhat kind of hover styles we have.\nLet's refresh. So when we hover\nover our subscribe button,\nit seems to turn a little bit\nmore light, and if we click it,\nit becomes even lighter.\nSo the way to make our button lighter is\nusing a new property that I'm going to\nintroduce. So let's get rid of these\nfor now. Let's save and refresh.\nSo we got rid of those\npseudo classs styles.\nWe're going to set a CSS\nproperty called opacity.\nSo opacity tells us how\nSeeThrough and HTML element is.\nIt takes a value between zero and one.\nA value of one means that this\nelement is completely normal.\nSo if we save this and refresh, you\ncan see that if we hover over it,\nit's completely normal. And\nas we decrease the opacity,\nlet's decrease it to 0.7.\nThe elements start to fade.\nSo if we decrease it even more to 0.3\nrefresh, now it's even more faded.\nSo the opacity is used\nto fade out an element.\nIf we go from one to zero, the\nelement's going to fade out.\nSo if we said it's a zero and refresh,\nnow it's basically completely\ntransparent and see through.\nIf the opacity goes from zero to one,\nthat means the element's\ngoing to start to fade in.\nSo that's how opacity works\nfor now. If we hover over it,\nlet's set the opacity to maybe 0.8.\nSo it's going to be a little bit see\nthrough, but not totally see through.\nSo let's refresh and hover over it. Okay,\nlet's look at our design. So that looks\npretty close to what we have next,\nlet's set the active styles. So in\nour design, if we click on this,\nit gets even lighter. So we're going to\nset an even lower opacity to make our\nbutton fade out even\nmore. When we click on it,\nlet's set it to something like 0.4\nor 0.5. Let's say save it and refresh.\nNow when we hover over\nit, now when we click,\nthe button gets lighter and we\ncan compare that to our design,\nand that looks pretty good to me.\nNow we're going to work on the\nhover styles for our join button.\nSo if we look at our design, the colors\nfor this drawing button sort of inverts.\nSo the background color and the text\ncolor, they reverse. So to do that,\nwe're going to go into\nour code, and again,\nwe're going to target the\njoin button with a dot join\nbutton.\nAnd we're going to add a pseudo\nclass called colon hover.\nAnd now all the styles inside here will\napply when we hover over this button.\nSo when we hover over it, we\nwant to invert the colors.\nSo we want to set the\nbackground dash color to\nour text color, which is this\ncopy paste.\nAnd we also want to set the text\ncolor to our background color.\nSo we're going to switch them\nup. Let's copy paste here,\nsave it and refresh.\nAnd now when we hover over our join\nbutton, that looks pretty good.\nThe next thing is when\nwe click the join button,\nyou'll notice that it also fades out.\nSo we're going to add an active\npseudo class to this button as well.\nSo target the join button class\nand add a pseudo class called\nactive.\nSo these styles will activate\nwhen we click this element.\nSo let's set the opacity to maybe 0.7,\nmaybe save it, refresh, click it. Okay,\nso I think that looks close\nenough. So 0.7 looks pretty good.\nSo that is how we set hover styles and\nother pseudo classes with our CSS code.\nNext, we're going to learn\nhow to transition smoothly\nbetween these two styles.\nSo for example, if we go back into our\nproject and we hover over this button,\nyou notice that the background color\nand the text color change smoothly,\nbut for our colors, it\nchanges almost instantly.\nSo how do we make this\ntransition? So to do that,\nwe're going to scroll up to\nour subscribe button. First,\nwe're going to add a\nproperty called transition.\nSo transition property takes two values.\nThe first one is what we want\nto transition. So in our case,\nwe want to transition\nthe opacity smoothly.\nSo we want to smoothly fade out the\nbutton when we hover over it instead of\ninstantaneously. So let's\ntransition the opacity.\nAnd the second value is how\nlong this transition will take.\nFor example, let's set it to\none s, which is one second,\nend it with a semicolon and\nsave. Let's go back and refresh.\nAnd now when we hover over our button,\nyou'll notice that the\nopacity changes smoothly.\nNow it might be a little bit hard to see,\nso let's change this to\n0.1 to show you the effect\nrefresh.\nSo now you can see that the opacity\nis changing smoothly over one second.\nSo this is how you transition between\ndifferent styles when you're hovering over\nthem. Now let's set it back to 0.8,\nand we're going to change one second\nbecause it's a little bit too long.\nSo usually a good transition\nduration is something like\n0.15 seconds. So it's pretty fast,\nbut it's not too fast\nand it's not too slow.\nLet's go to our webpage and\nrefresh. Now when we hover over it,\nwe get a nice smooth transition. It\nmight be a little bit hard to tell,\nbut we do get a nice smooth transition\ninstead of what we had before,\nwhich transitioned immediately.\nLet's work on the join button now.\nSo this one is a lot easier\nto see the difference.\nLet's scroll down to the\njoin button. And again,\nwe're going to add a transition.\nSo we're going to add transition,\nand we're going to give it two values,\nwhat we want to transition and how long.\nFirst,\nlet's transition the background\ndash color and how long we're\ngoing to transition for\none second. As an example,\nlet's save our file and refresh. Now,\nwhen we hover over the join button,\nthe background color changes\nsmoothly over one second,\nbut you notice that the tax\ncolor changes immediately,\nwhereas the tax color here\nalso kind of transitions.\nSo to make the tax color\ntransition as well,\nwe need to add another\nproperty to transition.\nSo we can actually transition\nmultiple properties.\nWe just have to separate it with a\ncomma. So if we have a comma here,\nwe can add another property\nto transition. This time,\nI'm going to transition the color, and\nwe're also going to give it a duration,\nwhich is one second. So how long it\ntakes to transition this property,\nsave it, and refresh. Now,\nwhen we hover over this button,\nit will transition both background\ncolor and the color smoothly over one\nsecond.\nAnd that's basically how transitions work.\nSo sometimes you might be tempted to\nput this transition property into the\nhover because you think that we\nwant to transition when we hover,\nso we have to put it here. Now, the\nproblem with this is that if we refresh,\nwhen we hover over the\nbutton, everything looks good.\nBut as soon as we hover out,\nthese styles change immediately.\nAnd that's because remember, these\nstyles only apply when we're hovering.\nSo if we are hovering,\nthen we have a transition.\nBut as soon as we take off the hover,\nit's the same thing as\nhaving no transition at all.\nSo that's one common pitfall\nof the transition property.\nSo let's move it back\nhere where it should be.\nSo just make sure that you put the\ntransition always in sort of base CSS\nstyle.\nThe last thing we're going to learn in\nthis lesson is how to create shadows.\nIf we go to our project and we look at\nour design, I'm going to zoom in here.\nWhen I hover over the tweet button, it\ncreates a faint shadow under the button.\nSo we're going to learn how to create\nthis. So let's zoom out for now.\nWe're going to go down to\nthe tweet button styles,\nand the shadow is just\nanother CSS property.\nSo the property for a\nshadow is box dash shadow\ncolon. Now, box shadow\nactually takes four values.\nSo I'm going to set the\nvalues to zero for now,\nand then we're going to change them\none by one to see how they work.\nLet's save this and refresh.\nAnd now we do have a shadow,\nbut we can't see it because it's\nright underneath the button.\nSo the first value here determines\nthe horizontal position of the shadow.\nFor example, I can set it\nto 10 pixels, and if I save,\nthe shadow will appear\n10 pixels to the right.\nThe second value sets the vertical\nposition of the shadow. For example,\nif I set it to 10 pixels\nin the second value,\nit will push a 10 pixels down.\nSo now you can see we actually do have\na shadow 10 pixels to the right and 10\npixels down from the button.\nNow the third value here is the blur.\nSo if we set the blur to maybe 10 pixels,\nsave and refresh, now the\nshadow becomes blurred,\nand the last valley is\nobviously the color.\nSo we can actually change\nit to whatever we want.\nWe can actually change it to\nsomething like red, save it refresh,\nand we get a red shadow.\nSo this is basically how shadows work.\nWe have a horizontal position,\na vertical position, blur\nand color. So don't worry,\nthe more that you work with shadows,\nthe more you'll get familiar with\nwhat these four values can do.\nSo let's try creating a\nmore realistic shadow.\nUsually shadows aren't red or any color.\nThey're usually kind of a darker\nshade of whatever they're covering.\nSo to create a color like that,\nwe're going to need a new way of\nmeasuring color. So let's get rid of this,\nand we're going to use\nsomething called R G B A.\nRrg. B A is the same thing as rrgb,\nexcept there's an A value.\nSo this a value essentially\nmeans the opacity of the color,\nhow SeeThrough it is.\nWe can set the RGB 2, 0, 0, 0.\nThat gets us to black as we learned.\nAnd then the fourth value is our A\nvalue. If we set it to one and save,\nthis is going to be pure black.\nBut as we decrease a value,\nthe color is going to get more and more\nfaded out and more and more transparent.\nSo if we decrease it to 0.6,\nsave and refresh.\nNow this color is getting more\ntransparent and faded out.\nSo a pretty natural color for\nshadow is something pretty faint,\nlike 0.15. So for shadows,\nwe usually don't want\nit to be too noticeable.\nShadows are best when they're very subtle.\nAnd now we kind of want to move the shadow\na little bit closer to the button so\nit looks a little more natural.\nSo let's actually move it\nmaybe five pixels and five\npixels. Let's see how that\nlooks. Save it and refresh. Okay,\nI think that looks pretty good.\nSo that's how we create a natural looking\nshadow with the box shadow property.\nWe have four values, the horizontal\nposition, vertical position, the blur,\nand the color measured.\nWith R G B A,\nthe value means opacity or\nhow C through this color is.\nThe final step of this lesson is to only\nmake this shadow appear when we hover\nover the button. So for example,\nfor here, if we hover over,\nwe can see the shadow. If\nwe're not, the shadow's gone.\nSo this is another style of\nbutton that we can create.\nSo let's use what we\nlearned so far. Remember,\nwe first use a.to target the class.\nSo we're going to target\nthe tweet dash button class.\nWe're going to add a pseudo\nclass here called hover,\nand then we're going to move our\nshadow into the hover pseudo class.\nLet's cut and paste in here.\nSo remember, the way this works\nis that let's refresh first.\nIf we are not hovering over the\nbutton, we get all of these styles.\nIf we are hovering over the button,\nwe're going to get these styles,\nthese hover styles,\nas well as all of these. So these\nstyles get added on when we hover.\nSo now when we refresh and\nwe hover over this button,\nwe're going to get a pretty\nsubtle shadow. It's not perfect,\nbut I think it's close\nenough to what we want.\nNow the last thing we're going to\ndo is to transition the shadow.\nSo we can actually transition the\nshadow pretty easily by just adding the\ntransition property,\nand we're going to tell it what we\nwant to transition and how long.\nSo you want to transition\nthe box dash shadow,\nand let's transition it to something\nnatural, like 0.15 seconds.\nNow save and refresh. Now,\nwhen we hover over this button,\nwe get a nice transition\non the shadow like this.\nAll right,\nso the last thing we're going to do\nis I realize I forgot to change the\ndurations here.\nSo let's change it to 0.15 and 0.15.\nLet's save it and refresh.\nSo now this looks something like\nwhat we have in our designs.\nSo we just learned some\nintermediate H C M L skills,\nsuch as creating hover effects,\nother pseudo classes, transitions,\nand shadows.\nHere are some more exercises from famous\nwebsites that you can try to copy.\nThis time. We're also going\nto copy the hover styles.\nAs always, you can find these solutions\nand more exercises below the video.\nIn this lesson,\nwe're going to learn about one of the\nmost useful tools for web development\ncalled the Chrome Dev Tools,\nand we're going to use the dev tools\nto get perfect colors for our buttons.\nSo first of all, what\nare the Chrome dev tools?\nSo I find that it's all easier to\ndemonstrate it than to try to explain it.\nSo let's go to our website\nand we're going to click in an\nempty area and we're going to click\ninspect, and this will\nopen up the dev tools.\nSo the cool thing about this is that we\ncan now see all the HTML on our page.\nIf we draw down here, we\ncan see all the buttons.\nSo this is a great way to visualize the\nHTML as well as the CSS on our page.\nIf I click into one of these buttons,\nI can see all the CSS that is\napplied to this button. So what's\nbetter is that we can open the dev\ntools in any website that we want,\nso we can actually open\nit in super simple.dev\nand you can see all the HTML that is\non this website as well as all the\ncss.\nSo this is a really great tool where\nyou can open it in any website that you\nwant and see the exact styles that\nthey're using on that website.\nThe next feature I want to show you\nis this pointer icon in the top left.\nSo instead of trying to find\nthese buttons in all of this html,\nwe can actually click this pointer\nicon and it will let us hover over any\nelement on the webpage\nand show it down here.\nSo if we hover over this\ntweet button and click it,\nit will find the element\nfor us in the html.\nAnd now we can look at these styles\nhere to see what kind of styles and more\nimportantly,\nwhat kind of background color is set on\nthis button so that we can get a perfect\nbackground color. So one thing to\nnote is that this background color is\nactually another way of measuring color.\nSo currently we learned about rgb.\nNow we have another way of measuring\ncolor, and this is called hex.\nIt's basically the same as rgb.\nThe first two characters here,\none in D represent how much red. The\nsecond two represent how much green,\nand the third two represent how much\nblue. So with a little bit of math,\nwe can convert from hex to rgb.\nSo I just google a hex\nto RGB calculator and I\nfind any calculator and\nthen I use it to convert\nthe hex value.\nSo I'm going to copy this into\nthe calculator and then convert it\nand it will give me the RGB value,\nso it'll do that math for me.\nSo that's just another way of\nmeasuring color called hex.\nThe next feature I want to show you in\nthe dev tools is this computer tab. So\nthis tab actually shows us all the\nfinal styles that are applied to this\nelement.\nSo we can actually scroll down here and\nwe can find the background color in the\nRGB value.\nWe can also find things like the height,\nthe final calculated height,\nthe final calculated width so that we\ncan get the perfect size as well as the\nperfect background color.\nSo let's actually just use\nthe background color here,\nand we're going to copy this\nand paste this into our code.\nSo we're going to get an exact color\ninstead of trying to guess it like we were\nbefore. So if I copy\nand paste here, save it,\nand now refresh.\nNow our button has the exact\nsame color as what we have here.\nSo the same thing happens\nfor the join button.\nLet's click this icon here and hover\nover the join button to find it in the\nhtml click. And now we\ncan see all these styles,\nall the final computed styles on the\njoin button. So most importantly,\nwe can find the order\ncolor, which is this.\nLet's go into,\nlet's copy it and put it into our CSS\nso that we can get a perfect color.\nEnd it with a semicolon to\nfollow the syntax rules.\nCopy it there and copy it here.\nNow we're going to save refresh,\nand now our button color is going\nto match the design. Exactly.\nSo that's how you use the dev tools\nto get perfect color for our HTML\nelements.\nNow we're going to learn\nabout the CSS box model,\nwhich basically allows us to add space\nbetween our elements like this as well as\nadd space inside our\nelement to make it bigger.\nThe first part of the box model is\nspacing on the outside of the element.\nThis is called margin.\nIf we look at our code,\nwe already worked with margin before here.\nWe set the margin right to eight pixels.\nThat means that we added space on the\noutside of the button on the right of\neight pixels. If we change the margin\nright to 30 pixels for example,\nand save and refresh. Now there's\n30 pixels of space on the outside,\non the right side of the button. So we\ncan add margin to all four directions,\ntop right, bottom and left.\nLet's try adding margin to\nthe left side of the button.\nThis time we're going to add\nmargin left of 20 pixels,\nsave it and refresh.\nAnd that adds space on the outside of\nthe button on the left of 20 pixels.\nSo that's basically how margin works.\nIt lets us add spacing on\nthe outside of the element.\nThe second part of the box model is\nspacing on the inside of the element.\nSo basically all these spacing\nin here around our text.\nSo currently if we look at our code,\nwe're setting the height\nand width of our buttons.\nAnd this is not actually a good idea.\nI'll show you why.\nI'm going to scroll down to the join\nbutton because it's a little easier to\nsee and I'm going to\nchange the text to join my\nchannel, save it and refresh.\nAnd you'll notice that the text is\nactually overflowing the button like this,\nand that's because if we scroll up,\nwe're setting the height and the width.\nThat means that we're forcing the button\nto have a height of 36 pixels and a\nwidth of 62 pixels. But here,\nnotice that our content is too big.\nSo what we want to do is to\nremove these lines and save it\nand refresh the page. And by default,\nour button actually adjusts the size\nautomatically based on the content.\nSo now instead of setting\nthe height and the width,\nwe're going to achieve the same thing\nby adding spacing on the inside of the\nbutton.\nSo the spacing on the inside of the button\nis called padding. Let's go into our\ncode and give it a try.\nSo we're going to add\npadding dash left of 30\npixels, save it and refresh.\nAnd you can see that padding add\nspacing on the inside of the button.\nAnd just like margin, we can set\npadding in all four directions.\nSo let's try adding padding dash top\nto 20 pixels, save that and refresh.\nAnd now you can see that we added\npadding on the top by 20 pixels.\nSo we can actually use the chrome dev\ntools that we learned earlier to visualize\nthe margin and padding of our elements.\nLet's go into a blank area of our webpage\nand we're going to right click and\ninspect and then click this top\nleft icon and then click our\nsubscribe button.\nSo I'm going to drag this down and then\nwe're going to go into the computed\ntab.\nSo this section is basically the\nbox model. We have our margin,\nwhich is a space on the\noutside of the element.\nYou can see that highlighted\nin orange. We have the border,\nwhich we learned earlier,\nand we have the padding,\nwhich is the space on the\ninside of the element,\nwhich you can see highlighted\nin green buttons by default,\nhave a padding of six pixels on the\nleft and right and one pixel on top and\nbottom.\nSo let's click this top left again and\ngo to our drawing button and click this\nbutton. In this example we have\npadding on the top of 20 pixels,\nwhich is what we have in our code. We\nhave padding on the left of 30 pixels,\nalso what we have in our code.\nAnd then we have a default padding of\nsix pixels on the right and one pixel at\nthe bottom. And for this button we\nhave a border of one pixel wide,\nwhich you can see here in our code.\nSo all of these combined\nmake up the c s s box model.\nThis basically determines how much space\nand element takes up on the page and\nhow far it is away from other elements.\nSo now that we learned the box model,\nwe're going to use it to\nrecreate our design here.\nSo currently if we look at our\ncode, we're using height and width.\nLet's replace this with the box model.\nLet's get rid of this\nand save it and refresh.\nAnd now our buttons back\nto what it was before.\nAnd now we're going to add padding to\nthis button so that it matches the design\nat the bottom here.\nSo let's add some padding dash top of 10\npixels.\nSo we'll add spacing on the inside of\nthe button at the top here of 10 pixels.\nWe're also going to add padding\ndash bottom of 10 pixels.\nSo let's save that and refresh. Okay,\nso now we have space at the top and\nbottom, so that looks pretty close.\nWe're also going to add space on\nthe inside on the left, right?\nSo we're going to add\npadding dash left of 16\npixels and padding on the right\nof 16 pixels.\nSo let's save that and refresh.\nAnd I think this looks close\nenough. So using padding,\nwe added spacing on the\ninside of our button.\nAnd the good thing about this is that\nif we change the text like this and save\nit and refresh, the button\nwill resize with the text,\nbut it will keep the\nspacing on the inside.\nSo using padding is a better\nalternative to height and width.\nSo let's save that and refresh the page\nand let's actually move these\nbuttons back closer together.\nSo currently if we scroll up,\nwe have margin on the right of 30 pixels.\nSo spacing on the\noutside of the button on\nthe right of 30 pixels,\nwe're going to change back to eight\npixels so that it's closer like we have\nin our design, save it and refresh. Okay,\nso that looks pretty good.\nNow one thing you'll notice is that our\nbuttons are not aligned with each other.\nSo the join button is all the way at\nthe top while our subscribe button is a\nlittle bit below. So why is\nthis happening? By default,\nthe browser tries to align\nour buttons based on the text.\nSo notice that the text\nis in one line like this.\nSo that's the default\nbehavior of the browser.\nThis is because browsers in the\nbeginning were mostly text-based.\nNow to override this behavior and\nalign everything to the top like we had\nbefore,\nwe can go into our CSS and we're\ngoing to add a property called\nvertical dash Align,\nand we're going to set this to top. So\ninstead of aligning the buttons based on\nthe text like this,\nwe're just going to align everything\nto the top If we save that and\nrefresh. Now the subscribe\nbutton is aligned to the top,\nwhich is right there. Let's do the\nsame thing for the tweak button.\nWe're going to scroll down\nand we're going to add\nvertical dash align top here as well.\nSave and refresh. And now\neverything's aligned properly again.\nNow let's work on the join button.\nI'm going to scroll down and\nremove this extra text here,\nsave it and refresh. And now we're going\nto go to our CSS for the join button.\nSo I'll scroll up to right here and\nwe're going to adjust the padding.\nSo let's actually just borrow the padding\nfrom the subscribe button because they\nlook pretty similar.\nSo I'll scroll up here\nand copy these and just\nmove them down to the\njoint button right here.\nSave that and refresh. Okay,\nso that looks pretty good,\nexcept our joint button\nlooks a little bit off.\nIt looks a little bit taller\nthan our subscribe button,\nand that's because the border actually\nadds a little bit of size to this button,\nso it adds one pixel\non the top and bottom.\nThat's why this button is taller than\nthe subscribe button. So to compensate,\nwe're actually going to reduce the\npadding at the top and the bottom by one\npixel, say save it and refresh.\nAnd now they're the same size. We have\nnine pixels of space on the inside,\nplus the one pixel of the border width,\nand that matches the 10 pixels of space\non the inside of the subscribe button.\nAnd I'll leave changing the tweet\nbutton up to you as an exercise.\nSo that is a CSS box model.\nEvery element can have spacing on the\noutside called margin space on the inside\ncalled padding as well as a border.\nAnd these properties determine how much\nspace and element takes up on the page.\nHere's some exercises of using the box\nmodel to get yourself more familiar with\nthis concept and these properties.\nFor most of the course, we've been\nworking with buttons. In this lesson,\nwe're going to work with text and\nwe're going to learn how to style text.\nSo just like our button lesson,\nI've created an exercise that\nwe can practice with text.\nSo we're going to go to super\nsimple.dev/exercises/text.\nAnd now we have some texts from YouTube\nand Apple that we're going to learn how\nto copy. So first of all,\nlet's create a new HTML file where\nwe can focus on practicing text\nstyles.\nSo I'm going to go here and create\na new file and let's just call this\ntext dot html.\nAnd now we're going to open\nthis file in our browser.\nSo open the folder that contains\nour code and right click\nopen with Google Chrome.\nI'm actually going to put\nthis up here. All right,\nso now we're ready to begin.\nIf you've ever written a text document\nbefore using something like Google Docs\nor Microsoft Word, you've\nprobably seen something like this.\nThis is a toolbar that allows us\nto change the style of our text.\nWe can change the font, the text size,\nwe can make it bold, we can center it,\net cetera. In css, we have a\nstyle for each of these things.\nLet's go to our code and we're going to\nfirst start by creating some text on our\npage.\nSo let's first create a paragraph\nand then insider paragraph.\nLet's start with the text here.\nSo I'm going to copy and\npaste this into our paragraph,\nand I'm just going to reorganize\nthe code a little bit and save.\nRemember that in H T M L, these extra\nspaces and new lines don't matter.\nNow refresh the page and we have our\nfirst paragraph that we can practice with.\nNext, let's create a style element\nso we can write some CSS code.\nNow we'll set a class on this paragraph\nso that we can target it in CSS\nclass equals video dash title because\nthis is a video title that\nI copied from YouTube.\nSo let's save it and refresh.\nAnd now we can start targeting\nthis paragraph in our css.\nSo remember, we're going to\nstart with a.to target a class,\nand we're going to\ntarget video dash title.\nSo the first thing we're going to\nchange is the font to change the\nfont. The CSS property\nis font dash family.\nSo websites by default use the\nfont called Times New Roman.\nWe're going to change the\nfont to a font called aerial,\nsave it and refresh. And now\nyou can see we changed the font.\nLet's go to the next one.\nSo this is the font size and we can\nchange the font size using the property\nfont dash size,\nand let's change it to\nsomething like 30 pixels,\nsave it and refresh.\nAnd now we have a bigger font.\nThe next example is, let's make it bold.\nWe're going to go here and we're\ngoing to set the font dash weight\nto be bold,\nsave it and refresh. And\nnow we have bold font.\nSo as you can see, CSS has properties\nfor doing all of these things,\nand for most of these properties it's\npretty easy to Google them. For example,\nlet's Google for how\nto make a font italic.\nSo we'll go to Google and we just\nneed to search something like css,\ntext italic. And now in the first result,\nwe're going to go in here,\nand if you scroll down,\nyou can see this CSS font style italic.\nSo I'm going to copy this\nand paste it in my code,\nsave it and refresh. And\nnow we have italic text.\nThe last one I'm going to show you for\nnow is how to center this text because in\nour exercise we have an exercise\nwhere the text is centered to center\ntext. We're going to go to our code\nand we're going to type text dash a\nline.\nSo this is the property for centering\ntext or putting it to the left or to the\nright. Now we're going to\ngive a value of center,\nsave it and refresh, and\nthat's how we center our text.\nSo that was pretty easy right now let's\ngo ahead and try to copy this style in\nour exercise. So if you remember,\nthe general strategy for creating\nanything that we see is first create the\nelement with HTML and then\nstyle it with CSS one by one.\nLet's go ahead and do\nthat for this exercise.\nSo I'm just going to resize this\nback and we're going to start\nby resetting all of these\nstyles, save it and refresh.\nFirst I'm going to start with the\nfont family. So for this exercise,\nI actually use the font family aerial\njust to make it easier for us. So we're\ngoing to set the font dash family to\naerial, save it and refresh.\nNext, I'm going to change the font weight.\nSo this font is bold and I want\nto make my font bold as well.\nSo I'm going to add\nfont, dash weight, bold,\nsave it, and refresh. Next,\nlet's change the font size.\nSo I'm going to change this\nfont size to something bigger,\nlike maybe 20 pixels,\nsave it and refresh.\nAnd it looks a little too\nbig comparing to the design.\nSo let's tone it down just a\nlittle bit. Maybe 18 pixels,\nsave and refresh. Okay, so I\nthink that looks close enough.\nNext, you'll notice that this text\nsort of wraps around to a second line,\nwhile ours doesn't.\nThe way to make this happen is we're\ngoing to set a width on this title. Now,\nI know that in the previous section\nwe said it's bad to set a width,\nbut here it's actually what we\nwant because if we set a width,\nwe're going to force the text onto a\nsecond line. So let's go ahead and set a\nwidth right now,\nand I'll set it to something like\n400 pixels. Let's see how that looks.\nSave it and refresh. Okay, so\nit needs to be less than that.\nLet's do 300 pixels,\nsave and refresh. Okay,\nso that looks right to me now.\nAnd the final thing with the title is I\nnotice there's more spacing between the\nlines here than what we have.\nSo to adjust the spacing between lines,\nthe property is called line dash height.\nSo don't worry if it seems like we're\nlearning a lot of new properties.\nThe point of this lesson is for us to\ngo through some complicated examples\ntogether,\nwhich will prepare you for the exercises\nthat you can practice on your own.\nSo for this line height, let's\ntry something like 20 pixels,\nsave it and refresh. Okay,\nso it looks like that didn't work.\nLet's change it to 26,\nmaybe save it and refresh. Okay,\nmaybe 24, save and refresh. Okay,\nso I think that looks pretty close.\nNext, let's work on the second paragraph.\nSo we're going to create a new paragraph,\n3.4 M views.\nAnd now to create this dot,\nwe're going to create something\ncalled an HTML entity.\nSo an HTML entity lets us type out\nspecial characters, for example,\nthis dot and this check mark to get\nthe H html entity. For this dot,\nwe're going to Google html entity\nmiddle dot. And now if we scroll down,\nthis will give us some HTML code\nthat we can copy into our code.\nSo I'm going to copy this\nand then paste it here.\nAnd that's going to\ncreate a dot on our page.\nSo if I save it and\nrefresh, that's what we get.\nNow I'm going to type out the rest\nof the text in this paragraph.\nNow save that and refresh.\nSo now remember the general process\nis we created the element with html.\nNow we're going to style\nit one by one. First,\nlet's give this a class\nso we can target it.\nLet's call this video dash stats.\nAnd now in our S, we're\ngoing to style this text.\nWe're going to start with\nfont, dash family, aerial,\nsave, and refresh. And then we're\ngoing to change the font size.\nSo it looks like our design is a\nlittle bit smaller than what we have.\nLet's change the font\nsize to maybe 14 pixels,\nsave and refresh, and I think\nthat looks pretty close.\nNext, let's change the color.\nSo let's set a color of maybe gray\nand refresh. Okay, so\nthat's a little too light.\nSo to get an exact color,\nwe can right click in a blank area\nof the webpage, click inspect,\nand then we're going to inspect\nthe styles of this element.\nSo the trick to doing that is we're\ngoing to click this top left icon,\nhover over this element and click it.\nAnd then we can find all its\nstyles in the computer tab.\nSo if we scroll down, we\ncan get the text color.\nSo let's copy this and save.\nLet's refresh. And that looks\npretty good compared to the design.\nNext, let's adjust the spacing\nbetween these two paragraphs.\nSo remember from the previous lesson,\nthe spacing outside of an\nelement is called the margin,\nbut if we look at our code, we\ndidn't actually set any margin yet.\nSo why is there so much space\nbetween these two paragraphs?\nAnd the reason is if we write,\nclick in an empty area of the\nwebpage and click inspect,\nAnd we click this icon\nAnd hover over this paragraph.\nThis paragraph already has\nmargin at the top and bottom.\nSo if we click this,\ngo to computed as 14 pixels of\nmargin at the top and 14 at the\nbottom. And the same\nthing for this paragraph.\nAnd the reason for this is\nbecause paragraphs by default\ncome with margin at the\ntop and at the bottom.\nSo that's why there's all this spacing\nthat we have here where we didn't set it\nin the css.\nSo the general process is we're\ngoing to remove the default spacing,\nand then we're going to set our own\nspacing. So let's go into our code,\nand first we're going to\nremove the margin dash bottom\nof the title, set that to zero,\nand we're also going to remove\nthe margin at the top of the\nsecond paragraph and set it to zero,\nsave that and refresh.\nAnd now there's no default spacing\nbetween these and they're really close\ntogether. Next, we can set a\nmore precise margin bottom.\nSo let's set it to maybe 20\npixels. Let's see how that looks.\nSave it and refresh. Okay,\nso let's way too much space.\nLet's tone it down to\nsomething like maybe five,\nsave and refresh. Okay,\nso I think this looks pretty\nclose to the design actually.\nLet's move on to the next paragraph.\nWe're going to move all the way down\nand create a new paragraph element with\nthis text inside.\nAnd now for this check mark, we're\nalso going to use an HTML entity.\nNow I know that you can actually copy\nthis and put it into our code directly,\nbut some browsers might not support this,\nso that's why we're using HTML entities.\nWe're going to go to Google and we're\ngoing to search HTML entity check\nmark.\nAnd I'm going to scroll down\nand grab the HTML entity here.\nSo here we actually have three. I'm\njust going to take the first one, copy,\npaste, save it. Let's go back and refresh.\nOkay, so that looks pretty good. Next,\nlet's keep styling these one by one.\nSo I'm going to go a little bit faster\nhere because it's basically the same\nthing that we've been\ndoing for the first two.\nIt's called this one video author,\nand then we'll style it up here.\nSo we'll set the font family to your\naerial, like the rest of the paragraphs.\nGoing to set the color to\nthe same as this paragraph,\nit's a copy and paste.\nOkay, that looks pretty good. Oh yeah,\nwe have to set the font size\nlooks a little too big right now.\nSet the font size to 14 pixels.\nNext we're going to\nreset the default spacing here.\nSo we're going to set the margin dash\nbottom and remove it by setting it\nto zero, and also remove the margin top\nand set it to zero, save and refresh.\nAnd now we're going to\nset a more precise margin.\nSo let's try maybe 30\npixels, see how that looks.\nOkay, that's way too much.\nMaybe 20 pixels. Okay,\nI think that looks about right. Then\nwe're going to do the third paragraph.\nLet's go down here,\ncreate the element and\nthen style of it with css.\nI'm just going to copy\nand paste this in here,\nsave and refresh.\nFirst, let's give a class to the\ntext so that we can target it.\nLet's call this video dash description.\nGo up here, video dash description.\nWe want a font family of aerial,\na font size\nof 14 pixels and the same color,\nand we save it and refresh.\nOkay, that looks pretty good.\nAnd now we want to give it a width\nto make it wrap around like this.\nSo let's set the width to the\nsame as the title, which is 300\nwith 300 pixels,\nsave and refresh. Okay,\nso it looks like this IO is\nactually on a separate line.\nLet's make it two 80,\nsave and refresh. All right,\nso that looks pretty good,\nand I'm also going to make it two 80 up\nhere just to make sure they're the same.\nSo the last thing I'm going to change\nis the height or the space between these\nlines. To do that, we're\ngoing to use line height.\nLet's scroll down and then add another\nproperty called line dash height.\nAnd let's set this to 20 pixels.\nLet's see how that looks.\nSave and refresh,\nand let's set it to maybe 22 pixels,\nsave and refresh. Okay, so\nI'm pretty happy with this.\nAnd lastly, we're going to modify the\nspace between these two paragraphs. First,\nwe're going to reset the default margin.\nLet's get rid of the margin bottom on\nthe first one here and the margin top\non the second one. So margin dash top,\nI'm going to get rid of it and\nset it to zero, save and refresh.\nAnd then we're going to set a margin\nbottom, maybe the same thing as up here,\n20 pixels, save and refresh.\nAll right, so that\nlooks really good to me.\nWe just recreated a really nice looking\nstyle that you can find on youtube.com.\nAnd the general process that we use is\nfirst we created the elements with html,\nand then we style them\nwith CSS one by one.\nSo before we move on to the next exercise,\nI'm going to show you a\nway to clean up our code.\nSo if you notice all of our styles\nright now have a line called font,\nfamily Aerial.\nNow we can actually clean this up and\nremove the duplication by creating a new\nstyle.\nThis time we're going to target all\nparagraphs on the page and we're going\nto give all paragraphs,\nfont, dash, family colon,\nariel, save.\nSo this style is going to apply to all\nparagraphs, which means all of these.\nThat means that we actually don't\nneed this line in any of these\nclass styles anymore, so we can\nactually remove all of these.\nNow if I save it and I refresh,\nyou can see that nothing changes because\nthis is doing the same thing as the\ncode that we had before.\nSo you can also see from this example\nthat an element can be targeted by two\nsets of styles.\nFor example, for this code here,\nwe're targeting all P elements on the\npage and all elements with a class of\nvideo dash title. If we scroll down here,\nhere we have AP element that\nhas a class of video dash title,\nwhich means it's going to be targeted by\nboth this set of styles and this set of\nstyles. So it's being targeted\nby multiple sets of styles.\nNow another thing that we can clean up\nis remember how we reset the margins\nfor all of our paragraphs. Instead of\ndoing it for each one individually,\nwe can actually put it all\nup here. So for example,\nwe can set the margin dash top to zero\nand the margin dash bottom to zero zero,\nwe save it and we refresh.\nIt looks pretty much the same except\nwe're now cleaning up all of the default\nstyles up here so that we don't have to\ndo it in our code at the bottom. So we\ndon't need this anymore or this\nor this. If we save that and refresh,\nwe still get the same thing because we've\nreset all of our styles in this set of\nstyles.\nNow the last concept I want to show you\nbefore we move on to the next exercise\nis the fact that in this set of styles,\nwe're setting the margin bottom to zero,\nbut here we're also setting the margin\nbottom to five pixels and the margin\nbottom to 20 pixels.\nSo how does that work?\nWe're setting it to zero\nhere and to five and 20 here.\nWhich style does the element actually get?\nAnd the answer is we're getting these\nstyle down here. So if we refresh,\nyou'll notice that there's still 20\npixels of space between these two\nparagraphs.\nNow you might think that it's\nbecause this line is at the top,\nand then once we get to this line,\nit overrides anything that comes\nbefore it. But if we actually move\nthis to the top\nand we save and reload,\nyou'll see that we still have\n20 pixels of margin bottom.\nSo why is this happening? This is\nsomething called CSS specificity.\nIf we have multiple lines\nsetting the same property,\nthere's actually a priority that the\nbrowser follows. So in this situation,\nthis style has more\npriority than this style,\nand to determine which\none has more priority,\nwe have to look at this\nword before the brackets.\nSo this word tells us what\nthese styles are targeting.\nThis is known as a selector.\nThis is another selector that\ntargets a particular class.\nNow the selector that is the most\nspecific is going to have higher priority.\nSo this selector is actually\nmore specific than paragraphs.\nSo what I mean by specific is that this\ntargets all paragraphs on the page,\nand this targets a specific class.\nSo not all paragraphs are going\nto have this class of video dash stats.\nSo that's why this is more specific.\nIt targets a smaller group\nof elements than this.\nThat's why this line has\npriority over this line.\nSo that's just an introduction\nto CSS specificity. For now,\njust know that a class name\nlike this has more priority\nthan an element name like this.\nSo I'm going to move this code back\nand we'll continue with the rest\nof this exercise. Next,\nwe're going to copy this text from Apple.\nSo you can see that there is a background\ncolor and the text is centered.\nAnd also if I hover over\nthis part of the text,\nwe get a pointer on our mouse\nand we have an underlying\ntext. So let's see how we can do this.\nFirst we'll create the element and then\nwe'll style it one by one. So we'll go\ndown here and we're going\nto create a new paragraph\nand let's copy this text\ninto that paragraph.\nLet's copy and paste. Whoops. Okay,\nsave it and refresh.\nOkay, so that looks good.\nSo usually if you have a greater\nthen or less than symbol,\nyou want to create it with an HTML\nentity because the browser could confuse\nthese symbols with an HTML tag.\nSo I'm going to search\nfor the HTML entity for\ngreater than. So this is\nthe symbol that we want,\nand I'm just going to copy\nand paste this into our code,\nsave it, and refresh. Next,\nlet's actually add some\nspace at the bottom of this\nparagraph so that we can see\nour new paragraph clearly.\nSo we're going to here and just add some\nmargin to the bottom because it's a\nlittle bit too cluttered right now.\nAll right, so that looks pretty good.\nWe're going to start by adding\na class to our paragraph,\nso we can target it in\nour CSS class equals maybe\napple dash text,\nsave it and refresh and\napple text. Okay,\nand first I'm actually also going\nto give some spacing at the bottom\nso it's easier for us\nto see our actual code.\nSo 50 pixels at the\nbottom, save and refresh,\nand now it's a little easier\nto see what we're working with.\nSo next I'm going to change the font size.\nOne thing you'll notice is that\nthe font family is already aerial.\nIf we scroll back up,\nwe have this set of styles that\ntarget all paragraph elements.\nSo it's already set our\nfont family two aerial.\nLet's scroll back down and\nlet's adjust the font size.\nSo this one looks a little bit smaller,\nso let's set it to maybe 14\npixels. Let's see how that looks.\nSave it and refresh. Okay,\nso I think that looks pretty\nsimilar to the design.\nAnd now the next step is let's\nset a background color of red.\nNow,\na trick for getting the background color\nis we're going to right click in an\nempty area, inspect,\nclick this icon and click the\nelement we want to copy styles for,\nand then go to the computer\ntab and scroll down.\nNow we have the background color.\nI'm just going to copy\nthis and paste it in here.\nSo background dash color,\nwe're going to paste\nthat save and we refresh.\nOkay, we next we're going\nto do the text color.\nSo let's set the text color\nto white color dash white\nsave and refresh. And now\nif we look at our design,\nthis text is actually centered\non the page. So remember,\nthe property for centering\ntext is text dash,\nalign center,\nsave and refresh. Okay,\nand the last thing is there's some\nspacing at the top and the bottom here.\nSo here we actually want to add spacing\ninside our paragraph. And remember from\nthe previous lesson, spacing on the\ninside of an element is called padding.\nWe're going to add some\npadding to the top,\nmaybe 10 pixels and then\npadding to the bottom\nand 10 pixels. Let's see how\nthat looks. Save and refresh.\nOkay, so I think we could add\na little bit more padding,\nso let's change it to maybe 18 pixels,\nsave and refresh. All right, so\nI think this looks close enough.\nNow the last thing we're going to\nwork on is this text here that becomes\nunderlined when we hover over it. First,\nlet's learn how to create underlying text.\nWe're going to practice our Googling\nskills and we're just going to search for\nCSS text underlying. So keep it simple.\nAnd then in the first link we\nhave the text decoration property.\nWe scroll down, we have an overline\nline through and underline.\nSo let's grab this piece of code.\nI'm going to just copy it in here,\nsave and refresh. Now unfortunately,\nthis property actually\naffects the entire paragraph,\nbut we want it to only affect this\npart of the text. So how do we do that?\nWe're going to need to learn\nsomething called a text element.\nSo a text element is an element\nthat is inside a line of text.\nSo let's do an example\njust to see how it works.\nWe're going to go to the bottom and\nwe're going to create a new paragraph to\npractice with. And let's actually just\ncopy this text and put it in there,\nsave and refresh.\nAnd now we're going to create some\ntext elements on this paragraph.\nSo the first text element I'm going\nto show you is called the strong\nelement.\nSo now let's copy maybe this\ntext and then put it in there\nand save and refresh.\nSo the strong element here creates this\nbolded text that you see on the webpage.\nSo the thing to know about text elements\nis that they essentially exist inside a\nline of text and then they modify\nthat part of the text so they're not\nmodifying the whole thing.\nAnother text element we can\ncreate is the you element.\nSo this one creates some\ntext that is underlined.\nSo if we move this text into here,\nsave it and refresh,\nwe now get an underlying text element.\nSo that is how we style specific\nparts of a line of text.\nThe final text element I want\nto show you is called the span.\nSo let's create a span element\nand we're going to put this\ntext inside. So cut and paste,\nsave it, and refresh. Okay,\nso the span element is here, but\nyou'll notice that nothing changed.\nAnd that's because the span element is\nthe most generic text element. It has\nno styles.\nSo the span is really useful because\nwe can actually give it a class\nand we can style it ourselves\nand give it any style we want.\nNow we could add the class attribute\nto these other text elements like the\nstrong and the U element,\nbut notice that these text\nelements come with a default style,\nand that may not be what we want,\nespecially in this situation where we\ndon't actually want a style until we hover\nover it. So that's why we\nuse the span text element.\nIt lets us modify a specific part of the\ntext without affecting the whole thing,\nand it's the most flexible and\nwe can style it however we want.\nSo if we give it a class of span example\nand then go to our css,\nand then we target span example,\nwe can give it any styles\nthat we want. For example,\nwe can set a color of red.\nNow if we save this and refresh the span,\nnow turns this part of the text red.\nThe other cool thing is that everything\nwe know about CSS still applies.\nSo we can target span example colon hover,\nand these styles will only apply\nwhen we hover over the span.\nSo in this case, let's underline\nit because that's what we want.\nSo if we do text dash\ndecoration and underline\njust like up here, save it and refresh.\nNow this span has a color of red here,\nand when we hover over it, these style\napply and it's going to get underlined.\nLet's use what we learned\nhere. To finish up our example,\nwe're going to first remove this line\nbecause we don't want to underline the\nwhole thing.\nLet's refresh and we want to create a\nspan so that we only target this part of\nthe text. Let's go back down.\nI'm going to resize it a little\nbit just so that we can see.\nOkay, so we're going\nto scroll down to here.\nI'm going to wrap this in a span.\nSo just going to move this into here,\nsave refresh.\nAnd now we're going to style this span.\nSo remember we're going to give it a\nclass so that we can target it in our css.\nLet's call this the shop link, save it,\nand let's go here and we're\ngoing to style it now.\nSo shop dash link.\nSo remember the style for this is that\nthe mouse turns into this pointer.\nSo to do that, we're going to use\na property cursor, dash pointer,\nsave and refresh. So now when we\nhover over it, our mouse is a pointer.\nAnd the last thing is that we want it\nto be underlined when we hover over it.\nSo let's create a hover\nstyle shop dash link,\nand we're going to give this\npseudo class colon hover,\nand we're going to underline\nit with text decoration,\nunderline,\nsave it and refresh. And\nnow when we hover over this,\nit's going to turn our mouse into a\npointer and it's going to underline it.\nSo we've achieved the exact\nsame styles as art design.\nSo there's one last thing I'm\ngoing to show you in this lesson.\nLet's go back into our code.\nWe're going to scroll all the way to\nthe bottom and recall that in H T M L,\nif we have multiple spaces like this,\nit will combine them all into one space.\nSo if I save this and refresh,\nyou'll see that only\none space shows up here.\nSo I'm going to show you how to\nget over this problem. Basically,\ninstead of typing out\nmultiple spaces in our html,\nall we have to do is set a\nmargin left on this text element.\nSo we're going to set a margin left on\nthis element and it's going to add spaces\non the left. So as an\nexample, let's scroll up\nand we're going to add margin left\nto our span element here, and\nlet's do something like 12 pixels,\nsave it and refresh. And now we\nhave spacing between our words.\nSo this is how we achieve\nmultiple spaces between our words,\neven though H T M L combines them.\nSo that is how we create really\nprofessional looking text like this and\nlike this, we first create\nthe element with H T M L,\nand then we style it one by one with css.\nAnd if we want to style only\njust a part of the text,\nwe have to use a text element like a span.\nIn this lesson,\nwe're going to learn the proper structure\nof html and that's going to give us\naccess to all the features of\nhtml. So up until this point,\nwe've actually haven't been following\nthat structure. For example,\nif we look at our code, if we scroll down,\nwe can see that we're creating\nelements directly like this.\nIf we go to our website\nhowever, and we write click and\nwe look at our html,\nwe can see that we have some elements\nhere called the HTML element,\nthe head element and the body element.\nSo this is a structure that we're actually\nsupposed to have in our HTML file,\nand because we don't have it, the browsers\nautomatically creating this for us.\nSo this was fine in the previous\nlessons because we're just learning,\nbut it's actually best to\nhave this structure in our\ncode because we're actually\nmissing some useful features. So let's\ngo ahead and learn what this structure\nis and add it to our code.\nSo we're going to go back to all of\nour code and add in this structure.\nLet's go back to our very first HTML file,\nand at the top I'm going to add some\nspaces and we're going to learn what the\nproper structure is.\nEvery HTML file is going to\nstart with less than exclamation\ndoc type space, H T M L, greater that.\nSo you just have to type this line\nout exactly as I have it here.\nThis is not really an element,\nit's just a special line that\nhas a meaning to the browser.\nThis tells a browser to use a modern\nversion of html. If we don't have this,\nit sort of falls back to an older\nversion that has less features.\nThe next part of these structure\nis to create an H T M L element.\nSo this says there's a\nwebpage inside this element.\nThere's not much meaning to it,\nwe just have to have this at the top and\nthe closing tag at the bottom of every\nH T M L file. Next we're going\nto create this head element,\nso head and closing tag,\nand we're going to create\nthe body element. So body\nand closing tag.\nSo this is the proper structure of all\nof our HTML files and this is how we're\nsupposed to start and end our files.\nSo here you can see that we have\nan element inside. Another element,\nthis is called nesting. So not only\ncan we have text inside an element,\nwe can have other\nelements inside elements.\nWe've actually already seen an example\nof this in the previous lesson.\nWe put a text element, like\na span inside a paragraph,\nand that allows us to have some text\nin the paragraph that was styled\ndifferently. Here we have our\nsecond example of nesting.\nWe have a head and a body\nelement inside an HTML element.\nSo this doesn't actually do anything\nvisually unlike our previous example,\nbut it's part of the HTML syntax\nrules that we have to follow.\nEvery file has one and\nonly one HTML element,\nand this element represents\nthe entire webpage.\nAnd the HTML element is\ndesigned for nesting.\nIt's designed to contain one head\nelement and one body element,\nand then everything on our webpage is\nsupposed to go either inside the head or\ninside the body.\nSo both of these elements are also\ndesigned for nesting or to have elements\ninside.\nThe body element here is supposed to\ncontain all the elements that are visible\non the page. So let's\nactually open this website.\nWe're going to go into our folder that\ncontains our code and we're going to\nright click open with Chrome.\nSo on this website you can see\nthat the paragraph is visible,\nthe button and the link is visible. So\nall of this is visible on the website,\nso it should go into this body section.\nInside the head element are all the\nelements that are not visible on the page.\nSo here's an example of such an element.\nWe're going to create\nan element called title.\nSo the text inside the title here is\ngoing to change the text in the tab\nhere. So for example,\nif I use the text first website,\nthat's going to show up in the\ntab. So if I save and refresh,\nthat's where the title element shows up.\nBut notice that this title element\ndoesn't actually show up on the page and\nthat's why it belongs in the head section.\nSo the title is the first feature that\nwe get from following this structure.\nThe second feature that we get that's\nreally useful is the ability to\nautomatically reload our webpage\nwhenever we change our code.\nSo you may have noticed that\nevery time we change our code,\nwe have to go to our website and then\nrefresh the page to see our new code.\nNow we can actually avoid\nthis by following this\nstructure and then installing a\nVS code extension.\nSo let's go to this extension area here\nand we're going to install the extension\nlive server. I'm going to install this,\nand now we can use the live server\nto reload our page automatically.\nWhenever our code changes to open\nthis website in a live server,\nwe're going to right click and\nwe're going to click open with\nlive server.\nAnd now we've opened this website and it\nwill automatically refresh whenever we\nchange our code. So if I change\nthe code like this and I save now,\nit automatically refreshes without\nhaving us to go back and forth.\nSo that's a really useful feature\nto speed up our development.\nNow let's get some more practice and\nwe're going to convert both of these HTML\nfiles to use the proper structure First.\nI'm going to actually just\ndelete all the extra tabs here.\nAnd now let's work on the buttons file.\nNow the live server doesn't really work\nif we don't have that HTML structure in\nour code. So let's add\nthat structure first.\nI'm going to go up here and we're\ngoing to create the structure.\nSo remember we start with a doc type\nspace, H T M L, and then we're\ngoing to create an H T M L element.\nAnd then inside we're\ngoing to create a head\nand we're going to create a body element.\nAnd remember, the body contains\neverything that is visible on the page.\nSo if we scroll down,\nthese three buttons are\nvisible on the page.\nSo we're going to you move\nthese into the body element\nAnd now they're in the right\nplace. Now for this style element,\nremember that we said the style element\ndoesn't actually create anything visible\non the page, but it could change\nthe style of other elements.\nSo this is a good example of something\nthat should go in the head element\nbecause it doesn't show\nup visibly on the page.\nSo we're going to copy all of this\nand put it into the head element.\nWe're going to go up and we're\ngoing to save this in here.\nSo now all of our CSS code\nis in the right place,\nand now that we have the proper structure,\nwe can open this with our live server\njust to make sure everything looks good,\nlet's go here and add a\ntitle like we learned.\nAnd this is going to change\nthe text at the top of the tab.\nSo let's call this\nbuttons practice, save it,\nand you'll notice that it automatically\nreloads. Now we're going to learn\nanother feature that we get\nfrom following this structure.\nIf we look at our code,\nwe have all of our CSS code together\nalong with our HTML code. Now,\nthis gets confusing because we have a\nlot of lines of code and we're mixing two\ndifferent languages.\nTo solve this problem,\nwe can move all of our\nCSS into a different file.\nSo let's copy all of this and we're\ngoing to create a new file to just\ncontain our css.\nWe're going to go here and create\na new file and let's call it\nbuttons dot css.\nMake sure your file ends in dot CSS to\ntell the computer that this file contains\nCSS code.\nAnd now we're going to move\nour code into that file\nand save and save here.\nNow you'll notice that we\nlost all of our styles,\nand that's because we now need to\nload this new CSS file into our\nhtml. To do that,\nwe're going to learn a new\nelement called the link element.\nSo the link is sort of a special element\nbecause it doesn't require a closing\ntag like we've seen so far.\nElements like these are\ncalled void elements.\nSo if we search for\nGoogle and we search Void\nelements html,\nthis will give us a list of elements\nthat don't need a closing tag.\nSo these are the exceptions to the rule\nthat everything has to have a closing\ntag. So don't worry too much\nabout memorizing all of these.\nYou'll get more used to it the\nmore that you write H T M L.\nAnd I'll introduce Void\nelements to you one by one.\nSo here we're going to learn\nour first void element,\nwhich doesn't need a closing tag, but\nthis element takes two attributes.\nThe first one is called r e\nL, which stands for relation.\nSo what kind of thing are\nwe linking? In this case,\nwe're going to link in a style sheet,\nand then we have to tell\nit another attribute,\nwhich is H Ref.\nSo this tells a link,\nwe what file we're going\nto link into this file.\nSo here we're going to link\nour CSS file into our html.\nSo we're going to link buttons css. Okay,\nnow let's go back to our page. You\nnotice we don't have our styles,\nand now when I save this, we\nget all of our styles back,\nand that's because we're loading all\nthe CSS code found in Buttons css,\nwhich is all the code we\nhad before into our html.\nSo this is another way to load CSS\nwithout having to write it all in our\nHTML file. Now,\nthe big benefit of this is that each\nfile contains less code and each file\ncontains one type of code. So in\nthis file we only have H T M L code,\nand in this file we only have c s s code.\nSo it makes the files\nsmaller and more focused,\nand that's going to help us develop\neasier. Now, before we move on,\nI do want to talk about the HF attribute.\nSo the way that the computer finds\nthis file is that it's going to search\nright beside our HTML file.\nSo it's going to search right beside\nthe file that this code is in.\nSo it's going to look for a\nfile called Buttons Dos css,\nit finds it and it loads it into our html.\nBut if this file was in a folder,\nlet's create a new folder.\nLet's call this styles.\nLet's put the CSS file in our new folder.\nAnd now you notice that\nthese styles are gone,\nand that's because this link can't\nfind Buttons dot CSS anymore.\nWhat it's trying to do is it's trying to\nlook for a file called Buttons dot css\nbeside our html, and\nthere's nothing there.\nSo to link a file that's inside a folder,\nyou first have to give the name of the\nfolder that's beside the HTML file. In\nthis case it's Styles. Next,\nwe have to type a slash.\nSo this slash means we're\ngoing into the Styles folder,\nand then inside we're going\nto find the buttons dot css.\nSo this is something called File Paths,\nand this is basically how we locate\ndifferent files within our HTML code.\nSo let's save this, and now we're able\nto successfully link our CSS file.\nSo that's a little bit\nabout how file paths work.\nWe're going to need to use this later\non in this course when we recreate\nyoutube.com. Now let's\nget some more practice,\nand we're going to convert our final\nfile into the proper HTML structure.\nSo let's create the structure first\nbecause we can't use Live Server just\nyet. We're going to\nwrite a doc type space,\nHTML at the top, and then we're\ngoing to have an HTML element.\nAnd then inside we're going\nto have a head element,\nand then we're going\nto have a body element.\nNow everything that is visible\nis going to go inside the body.\nSo if we scroll down, all\nof our paragraphs are going\nto go inside the body,\ncut and paste, save it,\nand now anything that's not visible is\ngoing to go inside the head. So if we\nscroll down, the style element\nis not visible on the page,\nso it's going to go inside\nthe head element, cut\nand paste. All right,\nso now we have a proper HTML structure.\nWe're going to open this with live\nserver, move it to the left here,\neverything looks good, and we're\ngoing to do some more practice.\nWe're going to set the title\nagain just to get more repetition.\nIt's called this text Practice, save It.\nAnd you'll notice that\nthe title is set up here.\nAnd we're going to move all\nof this into a CSS file.\nSo let's create a new file called text dot\ncss,\nand we're going to move all\nof the CSS code into there.\nSo let's cut and paste it into here.\nNext we're going to link the\nCSS file in this HTML file.\nSo let's create a link element.\nIt needs two attributes,\nR, e, L, and H ref.\nSo we're going to link a style sheet,\nand the file is located\nright beside the HTML file.\nSo all we need to do is link text, css,\nsave it, and refresh.\nAnd it's back to where we were again.\nLet's practice moving this into a folder.\nNow we're unable to find text\nCSS beside our HTML file,\nbut there is a Styles folder.\nSo we're going to look\ninside the Styles folder.\nGoing to use a slash to go inside,\nand we're going to link\nthis text CSS file.\nAnd that is how we use file\npaths to link CSS files.\nThe last feature we're going to look at\nthat we get from this structure is the\nability to add a new\nfonts onto our website.\nSo websites have a set of fonts by\ndefault that we can use. For example,\none of them is called Aerial.\nAnother one that we've seen\nis called Times New Roman.\nThat's basically the font that\nwe get on a fresh website. Now,\nin addition to these default fonts,\nwe can actually load new\nfonts from the internet,\nand we're going to learn how to\ndo that within this structure.\nSo let's go to our webpage.\nAnd Google actually provides a lot of\nreally great free fonts that we can use.\nSo we're going to open a new tab,\nand we're going to\nsearch for Google Fonts,\nand we're going to go\ninto this first link. Now,\nthis website might look a\nlittle different for you,\nbut the general process\nis the same. First,\nwe're going to search\nfor a font that we like.\nSo a good font to use here is Robo,\nand this is the font that we're going to\nuse for our final project. We're going\nto pick this font,\nand then inside here we're going\nto pick the styles that we want.\nSo for example, I'm going\nto pick the regular style.\nAnd I'm also going to\npick the bold style here.\nSo I'm going to pick the bold\nstyle and then I'm going to go\nto the basket of fonts that I selected,\nand then Google is going to give me the\ncode that I need to load these fonts.\nAll we need to do is copy\nthis code exactly and then\nput it in our head section of our html.\nSo we're going to put it in our\nstructure in this head section.\nAnd now we've loaded a new font\nthat we can use on our website.\nSo now let's go back to our website\nand we're going to use this new font.\nSo remember that currently\nwe set our fonts to aerial.\nThis time we loaded the font called\nreto, and that's what we're going to use.\nSo let's change aero here to Reto.\nNow when I save the\nfont is going to change.\nAnd there you go.\nIt might not look that much different\nbecause Reto is very similar to aerial.\nBut if we inspect and we\nclick on this element and\ngo to the computer tab,\nwe'll see that the font\nfamily has now been to Reto.\nSo this is how we can load a huge\nselection of fonts from Google onto\nour webpage and use them on our website.\nSo those are the features that we get\nfrom following this HTML structure.\nEvery website that we create from\nnow on will always have an HTML tag,\na head and a body and\na doc type at the top.\nNow we're ready to work on the\nfinal project of this course,\nrecreating youtube.com. Just like before,\nI've created a page on my website that'll\nshow us what the final project looks\nlike.\nSo first we're to close all of our\nbrowser tabs because we're going to start\nover again,\nand then we're going to open a\nnew page and we're going to go to\nsuper\nsimple.dev/exercises/youtube.\nSo on this page you can see what\nour final project will look like.\nSo we're going to learn how to\nrecreate youtube.com that you see here.\nSo first, let's set up our\nproject in our code editor.\nSo let's go into here and\nlet's actually create a\nfolder that's going to contain\nall of our previous code.\nSo the final project is going\nto contain a lot of code,\nso we don't want to get it\nconfused with the previous lessons.\nSo let's call this\nintro dash two dash html\nand we're going to put\neverything inside this folder.\nWe're going to put this\nin here and these HTML\nfiles in here as well.\nNext we're going to create a new\nHTML file for our final project.\nSo let's create a file\ncalled YouTube dot html,\nand I actually put it inside this folder.\nI'm going to take it out\nby dragging it down here.\nSo now we have an intro to html\nfolder and our YouTube dot html\nand we're ready to get started. First,\nwe're going to set up the proper\nstructure of HTML that we learned in the\nprevious lesson.\nSo we're going to start off with\na lesson exclamation doc type\nand html,\nand then we're going to create an HTML\nelement that's going to contain our\nentire webpage. And inside here\nwe're going to have a head element\nAnd we're also going\nto have a body element.\nNow that we have the structure,\nwe can open it with live server.\nAnd now we have our blank page.\nSo this page is going to automatically\nreload when we change our code.\nNow before we can work\non the final project,\nwe need to learn two more HTML elements,\nhow to load images onto our website\nand how to create a search box.\nSo let's start with loading images first.\nSo I'm going to show you how you can\ndownload these thumbnails from my website.\nWe're going to right click\nin a blank area and inspect.\nNow if we click this icon in\nthe top left and hover over an\nimage and click it,\nand you might need to drag\nthis down to see the html,\nwe can find the image in the html,\nand here is the URL for the image.\nSo we can actually click this and\nit will open the image in a new tab\nand we can control S to save it.\nSo make sure we save this image\nin the folder that contains all of our\ncode. So that's this folder for me.\nI'm going to save it. And now in\nmy code editor I can see the image.\nNext we're going to create an HTML\nelement to load this onto our page.\nSo I'm going to go back to my page here,\nand then we're going to go into the\nbody and create the image element which\nis less than img, greater than.\nNow the image element is unique\nbecause it's another void element.\nSo we mentioned void elements\nbriefly in the previous lesson.\nIt's an element that doesn't\nrequire a closing tag.\nSo this is one of those\nexceptions to the rule.\nSo the image element takes\none attribute called src.\nNow this attribute tells a computer\nwhich image to display on the website.\nSo for us,\nthat image is the one we downloaded\ncalled thumbnail one WebP.\nSo we're going to display\nthumbnail dash one dot WebP,\nand when I save it, the image\nis now loaded onto our website.\nSo this source attribute\nworks the same way as the\nlink attribute that we saw earlier.\nIt follows the rules of file\npaths to locate our file.\nSo just as a reminder, if we\ntype thumbnail one dot WebP here,\nit's going to look for a\nfile named thumbnail one dot\nWebP right beside our HTML\nfile. It's going to find it and\nthen load it onto our website.\nBut now we're actually going to create\na folder because we have multiple\nthumbnails and we want to organize them,\nwe're going to create a folder called\nthumbnails and we're going to drag this\ninto that folder. So now\nfor this source attribute,\nwe don't have a file beside our\nHTML called thumbnail one WebP,\nand then you see this error here.\nSo this means that there is\nan error loading an image.\nNow to find it in the thumbnails file,\nwe're going to type\nthumbnails slash thumbnail one\nWebP. So first it's going to look for\na file or folder called thumbnails.\nBeside the HTML file, it finds this one,\nand then the slash here means to\ngo inside the folder and then find\nthis file inside that\nfolder, which is here.\nSo that's how we load\nimages onto our page.\nNow we're going to learn how\nto style our image elements.\nSo let's go into our head section\nhere and create a style element.\nNow before we do that,\nI forgot to do something which is\nlet's create a title for our page.\nSo we can call this youtube.com clone,\nand if we save this, the title will\nshow up in the tabs. All right,\nso let's learn how to style\nour image. So as always,\nwe're going to give it a class attribute\nand let's just call this thumbnail.\nAnd now we can target\nthis class in our css.\nSo dot thumbnail.\nNow all of the CSS properties that\nwe learned so far apply to the image.\nSome of them make sense\nand some of them don't.\nSo one property that obviously doesn't\nmake sense is something like font dash\nsize. So if I save it,\nyou'll see nothing changes because\nthere is no text inside this element.\nIt's an image. So even though this\nworks, it doesn't really change anything.\nNow a property that does make\nsense for an image is width.\nSo this was set the width of this image.\nLet's make it smaller to\nmatch what we have here.\nSo let's make the width\nsomething like 300 pixels.\nNow we save it and now the width\nof this image is 300 pixels.\nSo one thing you might notice is that\nwhen we set the width of an image,\nthe height also changes.\nSo before we had this\nnotice that the image was a lot taller,\nbut as soon as we set the width,\nthe height also adjusts. So that's one\nbehavior of images that we should know.\nWhen we set the width,\nthe height will also adjust so that\nthe image has the same dimensions.\nWhat I mean by same dimensions is that\nit keeps the same shape. So for example,\nif I set the height as well,\nthis is going to cause the image to\nlose its shape or lose its dimensions.\nLet's set the height to something\nlike 600 pixels, save it,\nand now you'll see that the\nimage is 600 pixels tall,\nbut it's lost its shape and\nnow it's become stretched.\nSo that behavior of an\nimage sort of keeps us safe,\nso it keeps the image looking nice. Now,\nif we really wanted an image\nthat was exactly 300 pixels\nby 300 pixels, what can we do?\nSo this image, as you can see,\nis getting stretched out.\nSo in addition to all the CSS properties\nthat we've learned so far,\nthe image element has its own properties\nthat are specific to an image.\nSo one of these is called object fit.\nSo this determines what happens if\nthis size doesn't match the images\ndimensions or the images\nshape. So for example,\nI can set a value of cover.\nSo this tells the image to\ncover this 300 by 300 area,\nbut it's also going to keep its shape.\nSo this area might not be big\nenough to show the whole image,\nwhich may or may not be okay\ndepending on what we want to do.\nNow we can adjust which part of the\nimage that we see using another property\ncalled object dash position.\nSo currently we're looking\nat the center of the image.\nWe can set the object position to left\nto view the left side of the image,\nor we can also set it to the right to\nview the right side of the image in the\ncase that the image\ndoesn't fit in our area.\nAnother value we can give\nto object fit is contain.\nSo if we save this,\nthe entire image is going to shrink\nuntil it is contained in this 300 by\n300 area. So I'm going to set a border\nso that we can see what this is doing.\nI'm going to set a border of two pixels,\nBorder width, two pixels\nborder style of solid order color of red.\nSo here the border shows\nus our 300 by 300 area and\ncontain makes the image shrink\nuntil it is contained in the area,\nbut that means that it might not be able\nto cover the entire area if it's not\nthe right shape. So in this case,\nthe object position can\nmove the image to the top\nor to the bottom.\nSo that's basically how\nimages work. As you can see,\na lot of the CSS properties that we\nlearned before like width and height and\nborder can be applied\nto the image element.\nAnd the image element also has some of\nits own properties that determine how the\nimage is displayed. So for now,\nlet's create something that's\nkind of like our final website.\nSo I'm going to set\nthe image with two 300,\nand I'm not going to set a height so that\nthe image doesn't stretch and we don't\nhave to do all this stuff and I can\nactually just remove all of this.\nSo the only thing I'm doing is telling\nthe image to shrink down to a width of\n300 and to shrink the height as well\nso that the image keeps its shape.\nSo we're going to stick with this for\nnow and this is going to correspond to\nthis part of our final project,\nand we're going to start learning how\nto build out the entire video preview.\nThe next element we're going to learn\nin this lesson is how to create search\nboxes like the one you see up here.\nSo let's go back into our website and\nwe'll learn the code for creating a search\nbox.\nThe HTML for creating\na text box is less than\ninput greater than.\nSo the input element is a void\nelement, just like the image element,\nit doesn't require a closing tag.\nSo the input element has several\nattributes that we can give it.\nOne of them is called the type.\nSo we set the type equals text,\nit's going to give us a text box.\nI'm going to save this,\nand now in our HTML you\ncan see we have a text box.\nAnother type that we can give to\nthis input is called checkbox.\nSo if I save this, now we have a checkbox.\nSo for our purposes we're going to set\nthe type to a text box because we want to\ncreate the YouTube search box up here.\nSo you also notice that this\ntext box has a word search in it,\nand when I start typing,\nthat search word is gone.\nSo this is sort of like a label for the\nuser telling them what to put into this\ntext box. And this is\nknown as a placeholder.\nSo if we go back to our website,\nwe're going to add a placeholder\nto our new text box. To do that,\nwe're just going to give\nthe attribute placeholder\nand let's set the placeholder\nas search. We save it.\nNow we have a placeholder that\ndisappears when we start typing.\nSo that's how we create what we\nsee on YouTube. So for the text\nbox,\nall of the CSS properties that we learned\nso far can be used on the text box.\nSo let's look at some examples.\nLet's add a class attribute first,\nlike always so that we can target\nit. Let's call it search dash bar.\nAnd then inside our css,\nwe're going to target\ndot search bar class.\nAnd then inside we can set our usual\nCSS properties. So for example,\nin this case,\nwe can set a font dash size\nand let's add it to 20 pixels,\nsave it and reload. And now you can\nsee that the font size has changed.\nAnother thing we can change\nis margin or the spacing.\nSo let's add some margin to the left\nof 12 pixels, save it.\nAnd now we have some spacing on the left.\nSo basically everything that we've\nlearned so far about CSS properties we can\nuse on the search box. For now,\nlet's remove these example styles and\nwe're going to style the search box to\nlook like our final project\nlater in the scores.\nIn this lesson,\nwe're going to learn one\nof the most important CSS\nproperties called the display\nproperty, and we're going to use this\nto start building out our final project.\nWe're going to start off by taking a\nlook at our final project and we're going\nto start building out the text here.\nSo we're going to create\nparagraphs for these text.\nSo let's go into our code and we're\ngoing to create three paragraphs.\nSo here's one of them,\nand we can copy the text.\nSo copy and paste.\nSo here's another paragraph\nand we're going to copy this\nand paste it in our code.\nAnd here's a final paragraph\nand we'll save. So here,\nI'm actually going to use the H T M L\nentity again instead of this special\ncharacter. So to save us some time,\nI'm just going to type it out here.\nNow I'm going to save this\nand go back to my webpage.\nAnd now we have the text\nthat we're going to use,\nbut you might notice something weird.\nHow come this text box\nis beside our image?\nIf we look at our paragraphs,\nthey are on top of each other,\nso one after another on each line.\nHow come text boxes and images\nappear on the same line?\nSo this is due to the display property\nin C S s and we're going to learn what\nthat is right now. In H T M L,\nthere are three types of elements.\nThe first type of element\nis called a block element.\nA block element takes up the entire line.\nSo a paragraph by default\nis a block element.\nWe can see that in our dev tools by\nright clicking in the browser and then\nclicking inspect, And then\nclicking this icon in the top left\nright here and then\nhovering over our paragraph.\nSo you can see that even\nthough the text goes to here,\nthe paragraph extends to the end of the\nline because the paragraph by default\nis a block element. Block\nelements take up the entire line.\nSo let's go into our code and I'm going\nto demonstrate another property of block\nelements.\nIf we set a class on the\nparagraph and we style it,\nso let's set a class of video dash title,\nlet's save it and we're\ngoing to style it and let's\nit a width of 300 pixels,\nsave and refresh.\nAnd now this paragraph is only 300 pixels,\nso it's not stretching to\nthe end of the line anymore.\nLet's verify that using the dev tools\nby clicking this top left and then\nhovering over.\nSo you see that the paragraph itself\nonly takes a width of 300 like we set in\nour css,\nbut it still takes up the entire\nline denoted by the orange part\non the right here. If we click on\nthis paragraph and we go to the\ncomputer tab, notice that there\nis no margin on the right side,\nbut we still have a ton of\norange area on the right.\nSo this is how block elements work.\nRegardless of how much\nspace they actually take up,\nthey take up the entire line,\nso they're forced to be on their own\nline like this paragraph and these two\nparagraphs. So that's what\na block element means.\nThe second type of element\nis an inline block element.\nAn inline block element only takes up\nas much space as it needs to and doesn't\ntake up the entire line.\nAn example of an inline block element\nis the image element and the input\nelement.\nThey only take up as much space as\nthey need to and they don't take up the\nentire line.\nSo another element could appear beside\nthem like we see here. So that's the\ninline block element.\nThe third type of basic HTML element\nis called the inline element.\nInline elements are\nbasically just text elements.\nThey appear within a line\nof text. So if you remember,\nwe briefly introduce the element strong.\nSo this element appears\nwithin a line of text like\nthis.\nSo this element makes a part of the text\nbold and it appears within a line of\ntext. So those are the three\nbasic types of HTML elements,\na block element, which takes up the\nentire line and inline block element,\nwhich only takes up as\nmuch space as it needs to,\nand an inline element which\nappears within a line of text.\nNow the most interesting of these three\nare the block elements and the inline\nblock elements because they determine\nhow these elements are displayed on the\npage, whether beside each other\nor above and below. In addition,\nwe can use a CSS property called display\nto easily switch between block and\ninline block. So let's\nsee how that would work.\nSo first let's start by switching\nfrom block to inline block.\nWe're going to switch both of these\nparagraphs to inline block elements.\nLet's go into our code and we're\ngoing to give this a class.\nLet's call this video dash\nauthor and let's call this\nvideo dash stats. And we're\ngoing to style these classes.\nSo we're going to style the\nvideo dash author as well as the\nvideo stats,\nand we're going to set both of\nthese to display inline dash block\nand this one as well\ndisplay inline dash block.\nI'm going to introduce a\nlittle bit of CSS syntax here.\nIf we have two sets of CSS\nstyles that are the same,\nwe can actually use a different\nsyntax by adding a comma here.\nSo this comma means that we're going\nto target both the video author class\nand the video stats class\nwith this set of styles.\nSo this is how we target multiple\nthings in CSS with a comma.\nSo as you can see, these two elements\nnow appear beside each other.\nThey're both inline block elements and\nonly take up as much space as they need\nto. If we click the top left in\nthe DEF tools and hover over this,\nyou'll notice that this paragraph is\nnow only taking up as much space as the\ntext and the same thing for this\nparagraph. So as you can see,\neven though paragraphs by\ndefault are block elements,\nwe can change them very easily to inline\nblock with the display property so that\nwe can put them beside each other.\nNext we're going to try\nthe opposite direction.\nWe're going to go from an inline\nblock element to a block element,\nand we're going to put these two on\nseparate lines. So let's go into our code\nand we're going to style\nthe thumbnail class.\nSo I'm going to scroll up here and\nI'm going to convert this to display\nblock, and now it will turn\nthe image into a display block,\nand this will cause the image to take\nup the entire line pushing the text box\ndown to the next line. If I save it,\nnow you can see that this image\nis taking up the entire line.\nWe're going to verify this by clicking\nthe top left and then hovering over this\nimage. So using this property,\nwe can control whether an element appears\non the same line or on a different\nline, and that's what we're\ngoing to do to copy this design.\nThe search bar is at the top.\nWe have an image and then three\nparagraphs each on a different line.\nSo we're going to use a display\nproperty to achieve this.\nLet's go into our code.\nAnd first let's put the\nsearch box at the top,\nSave it. And since our image\nis already display block,\nit's going to take up the entire line,\nso it's forced to take up a\nline below the search box.\nSo I think this is pretty good as\nlong as these search box is up there,\nthen we're good to go. Next,\nwe're going to turn these back into\ndisplay block because we want these on\nseparate lines like our\ndesign here. So to do that,\nwe're going to go into our code and\nwe could change this to display block,\nbut remember that paragraphs\nby default are display block,\nso we can just get rid\nof this code, save it,\nand now our elements are appearing at\nleast in the same structure as the design\nfrom top to bottom. And each\nelement is taking up its own line.\nSo that is the display property.\nIt allows us to control how\nan element is displayed,\nwhether they're a block element and take\nup the whole line or they're an inline\nblock element and only take up\nas much space as they need to.\nIn this lesson,\nwe're going to learn about the most\nimportant HTML element called the diviv\nelement.\nFor example, here's twitter.com.\nIf you look at the HTML that Twitter uses,\nyou can see that they're using lots and\nlots of divs. Here's another example,\nInstagram. If we look at Instagram's html,\nwe can also see that they're\nusing lots and lots of divs.\nSo what exactly is a diviv\nand why is it used so much?\nSo the diviv element stands for division,\nbut an easy way to understand this\nis that the diviv is just a box.\nWe're going to go into our\ncode and look at an example.\nSo below our paragraphs,\nlet's create a diviv element,\nand inside we're going to have\nsome text. This is a diviv,\nsave it.\nAnd now we have our first diviv element\non the page to show you that the diviv\nis just a box. We're going\nto right click and inspect,\nAnd then we're going to click this top\nleft icon and hover over the diviv.\nSo as you can see, we created\na box around our text.\nYou'll notice that this box stretches to\nthe end, and that's because the diviv,\nlike the paragraph by\ndefault is a block element,\nso it takes up the entire line, but\nlike we learned in the previous lesson,\nwe can easily change this to an inline\nblock using the display property.\nSo let's go ahead and do that and it'll\nbe more clear that this is really a box.\nSo we're going to set a class here.\nWe're going to call\nthis diviv dash example,\nand now we're going to style it\nand change the display to inline block\nSo that it doesn't take up the\nentire line anymore, save it.\nAnd now if we go to our webpage,\nclick this icon and hover over.\nYou can clearly see that the diviv\njust creates a box around our content.\nIn this case, our content is some text.\nSo that's basically what a diiv is.\nNow the second question is\nwhy is a diiv so useful?\nThe key feature of a diiv is that\nit can contain any other inside.\nSo right now we only have\nsome text inside the diviv,\nbut we can actually put\nparagraphs, we can put images,\nwe can put any elements inside\ndivs as well as other divs.\nDivs are meant to be containers.\nAnd if we look at the YouTube\ndesign that we have in our project,\nwe use containers everywhere.\nSo here's a container,\nhere's another container,\nand here's another container.\nThese containers allow us to group all\nof these elements together so that we can\ncreate a layout that looks like this.\nHere's another example from Twitter.\nHere's a container, here's another\ncontainer, and here's another container.\nIn order to build complex\nreal world website,\nwe need containers to group our elements\ntogether and lay them out on the page.\nAnd the diviv is the perfect\nsolution for this container problem,\nand that's why it's used so much.\nLet's go back to our website and we're\ngoing to practice using our diviv as a\ncontainer.\nSo we're going to create a container just\nlike our final project for this entire\nvideo preview here. So that means we're\ngoing to put all of these elements,\nthis image, and all three\nparagraphs inside our diviv.\nLet's see how that works.\nSo I'm going to get rid of this text first\nand then I'm going to change this div\nto a class of video dash preview\nbecause this is going to contain all\nthese elements that are part of a video\npreview.\nAnd then I'm going to move the\nimage and the three paragraphs\ninto the diviv.\nNow save,\nand you might not notice any difference\nbecause the diviv is simply just drawing\na box around the content inside,\nbut we can right click and\ninspect and we can see the\ndiviv in our H T M L here.\nAnd inside the diviv we have\nour image and our paragraphs.\nThe diviv is just creating a\nbox around all this content.\nSo now I'll show you why\ncontainers are so useful.\nWe're going to go into our code and we're\ngoing to change the width of our diviv\nelement here. So we're going to\ngo up here and we can remove this.\nLet's style the video preview class,\nand we're going to set\na width of 300 pixels.\nLet's see how that looks.\nSo the page doesn't look any different,\nbut if we click the icon in the top\nleft and then hover over our paragraphs,\nwe'll notice something interesting.\nThis paragraph is a block element,\nso it's supposed to take up the\nentire line, but in this case,\nbecause this paragraph is inside a diviv,\nit takes up the entire line in diviv.\nSo the way that block elements actually\nwork is that they take up the entire\nline in their container\nrather than on the page.\nSo that's really useful because\nif we look at our final project,\nso for these paragraphs, we want them\nto appear on separate lines like this.\nSo we do want them to\ntake up their own line,\nbut we don't necessarily want them to\ntake up the line on the entire page\nbecause we have some stuff on the right\nside here. So to solve this problem,\nwe put the paragraphs inside a container\nso that they take up their own line\nin the container and not in the page.\nAnd that's how we can create a layout like\nthis. Let's go back to our website.\nIf we hover over our diviv now,\nso this blue box on the\nleft is our container.\nIt groups all the elements together and\nkeeps it within that blue area that you\nsee. Now,\na really cool thing about this is that\nnotice that the blue box doesn't actually\ntake up the entire page.\nSo we can actually have a second\nbox beside it on the right.\nSo we can add another blue box on the\nright containing another video preview.\nSo now we're going to do\nthat, but first of all,\na diviv by default is a block element.\nSo notice on the right\nside it's all orange.\nThat's because this diviv is taking\nup the entire line. In this case,\nwe don't want it to take\nup the entire line anymore.\nThat's why we're going to convert\nit into an inline block element.\nSo let's go into our code.\nWe're going to go into the video\npreview and we're going to type display\ninline block. Let's save it.\nAnd now we can see that our diviv is a\ndisplay inline block and it's actually\nappearing beside our search bar\nbecause this is also an inline block.\nSo they're both only taking up\nas much space as they need to,\nand now they can appear\nbeside each other. However,\nwe do want the search box to\nbe at the top in its own line.\nSo we're going to practice using\nthe display property. Again,\nwe're going to set the\nsearch bar to display block\nso that it takes up the entire line\nand everything else is forced below it,\nsave it and refresh. And now if\nwe hover over this input element,\nwe can see that we forced it to\ntake up the entire line. Next,\nwe're going to create another video\npreview beside this one because this is\ninline block.\nNow we can put another diviv here.\nSo I'm just going to simplify this\nby making a copy of our current code.\nSo I'm just going to copy and paste,\nand now we have two\nvideo previews, save it.\nAnd there we go. We now have two\nvideo previews beside each other.\nSo they are two containers\nright beside each other.\nAnd remember in our css,\nwe set the width of these\ncontainers to 300 pixels.\nSo that's the amount of\nspace that they take.\nAnd we set their display to inline block\nso they don't take up the entire line\nand they can appear beside each other.\nAnd now we're on our way to creating a\nlayout that looks like this. In fact,\nlet's actually replace the second\nvideo preview here with this\ncontent. So to do that,\nwe're going to download the\nthumbnail and then change the text.\nSo let's right click and inspect.\nI'm going to click this top\nleft and then click this image.\nAnd now I can download the\nthumbnail by going to this url.\nAnd then clicking down here,\nI'm going to control S\nto save the thumbnail.\nSo I'm going to save it in the\nfolder that contains my code in the\nthumbnails folder along with our\nprevious thumbnail. So save it here,\nand I should see it in my\ncode editor right there.\nNext, we're going to swap out the\nthumbnails. So instead of thumbnail one,\nwe're going to set thumbnail two\nand we're going to change the text.\nSo I'm going to change this\ntext here to be my title.\nAnd I noticed we're still\nusing the strong element,\nwhich we can now delete because\nit was just for an example.\nAnd I'm also going to\nchange the channel name here\nand the video stats,\nwhich is 19,000,004 years\nand for years ago.\nSo now if I say\nthis, we have two different video\npreviews, but now we have a problem,\nyou'll notice that these two\naren't aligned with each other,\nand that's because this\ncontainer is actually a little\nbit taller than this one.\nThis piece of text here wraps\naround to a second line.\nWhile this one does not,\nhowever, to make it look better,\nwe want to align these at the top.\nSo we learned this way back\nin one of the earlier lessons,\nand we're going to review how to do\nthat. We're going to go into our code\nAnd we just have to set this\nproperty vertical align,\nand we're going to set it to top so\nthat these elements align at the top.\nI'm going to save it. And\nnow that looks pretty good.\nWe now have two different video previews\nand they are aligned with each other.\nThe last thing we'll do is to add\nsome space between them. So remember,\nthe space outside of an\nelement is called margin,\nand we're going to add margin to\nthis entire container right now.\nSo we'll go into our code. And\nin the video preview styles,\nwe're going to add margin dash, right?\nAnd let's set it to something\nlike 15 pixels, save it.\nAnd now we add in margin on the right.\nAnd now the interesting thing about\nthis is if we right click and inspect,\nand then in our HTML we find\nour diviv, which is here,\nyou'll see that the margin is\napplied on the entire diviv.\nSo that's how the div element works.\nIt's a container that groups other\nelements together so that we can create\ncomplex layouts like this and\neventually our YouTube project.\nAll right, so this is probably the\nmost important lesson of this course.\nWe're going to learn a technique\ncalled the nested layouts technique,\nand this is going to get us to a\nprofessional level with HTML and css.\nSo what is the nested layouts technique?\nThe basic idea is that there\nare two types of layouts.\nThe first one is a vertical\nlayout, which looks like this,\nwhere items are on top of each other.\nAnd then the second one is a horizontal\nlayout, which looks like this\nwhere items are beside each other.\nAnd by using a combination of\nvertical and horizontal layouts,\nwe can create almost anything that\nwe see on a website. So for example,\nlet's take the YouTube video\npreview that we've been working on.\nWe can break this down by\nusing a vertical layout.\nAnd then inside this vertical layout,\nwe're going to have a horizontal layout.\nAnd then inside this horizontal layout,\nwe're going to have a vertical layout.\nSo as you can see, we have layouts\ninside layouts, inside layouts,\nand that's why it's called the nested\nlayouts technique. And using this,\nwe can pretty much break down almost\neverything that we see on a professional\nwebsite into a series of layouts and\nthen recreate them using our code.\nSo now we're going to go through together\na way that we can practice using the\nnested layouts technique to break down\na design. We're going to go to our final\nproject. If you close it,\nyou can go to super\nsimple.dev/exercises/youtube.\nAnd what we're going to do is we're going\nto take a screenshot of one of these\ndesigns,\nand then we're going to use an image\nediting software to draw out the layout.\nSo first, let's create\na screenshot on Windows.\nYou can use an app called SNP on Mac.\nWe're going to type command shift\nn four to create a screenshot.\nSo let's take a screenshot of this\nand then we're going to upload this\ninto an image editing software. Now,\nfeel free to use anything\nthat you're comfortable with,\nbut if you don't know what to\nuse, we can go to a new tab.\nAnd we're going to search\nfor Google drawings,\nAnd we're going to use this to\npractice the nested layouts technique.\nSo once we have this open,\nwe're going to upload our image.\nI'm going to go to my computer\nand upload the screenshot.\nAnd now we're just going to draw some\nrectangles to represent our layout.\nSo we're going to go up here to shapes\nand we're going to create a rectangle.\nAnd first we're going to create\na vertical layout one and two.\nSo I'm just going to\ndraw a rectangle here.\nLet's change the background to transparent\nso we can see what's underneath.\nAnd I'll make the border a little\nmore thick and change it to red\nso it's easier to see.\nAnd now I'm going to copy\nthis and paste it to create a\nduplicate. And I'm just\ngoing to move it down here\nand resize the rectangle\nlike this. All right,\nso just like that we created\na vertical layout for now.\nDon't worry about the video time here.\nWe're going to recreate this later in\nthe course using another feature of css.\nAnd now looking at our design, we\nhave a horizontal layout one and two.\nSo to create a horizontal layout,\nwe're going to draw it out\nagain using rectangles.\nSo let's go in here and we're\ngoing to create another rectangle,\nand we're going to draw out the\nhorizontal layout like this.\nSo here's one,\nchange the background to your\ntransparent and make it bold.\nAnd I'm going to use the blue color\nto represent a horizontal layout.\nNow I'm going to copy\nthis and paste it here\nand resize it a little bit\nlike that. And now we have\nour horizontal layout.\nAnd finally inside here we're going\nto have a vertical layout like this.\nSo again, we're just going\nto keep drawing rectangles.\nI'm going to copy this\nand paste it and move it\ndown here and resize it a little\nbit so that we can see it.\nSo right here, and then copy this\nand then paste it again.\nWe're going to create the second\npart of our vertical layout\nlike that, and then copy\nand paste it one last time\nDown here.\nSo that's how we use the nested layouts\ntechnique to visualize and break down a\ndesign into a combination of\nvertical layouts and horizontal\nlayouts. Now let's do some more practice.\nWe're going to take another design and\nbreak that down using this technique.\nSo we're going to open a new\ntab and we're going to go to\ntwitter.com/super\nsimple dev,\nand we're going to take,\njust take one of my tweets here\nand take a screenshot of this.\nAnd we're going to break down this\ndesign using the same technique.\nSo let's go back to Google drawings,\nand we're going to create a\nnew drawing to practice with.\nAnd let's upload that\nscreenshot that we just took\nonto this new drawing right here.\nSo now we're going to do the same thing.\nWe're going to draw rectangles\nto represent the nested layouts.\nSo let's take a look at this to see\nhow we can break this down immediately.\nI see that we have a\nhorizontal layout one and\ntwo, so we can break it\ndown into that. First,\nlet's draw a rectangle to represent that.\nSo here's the first one,\nand I'm just going to make it blue\nto represent a horizontal layout And\ncopy and paste it like this.\nOkay, so that's our horizontal layout.\nAnd now looking at the design inside here,\nI can see that we can break it down\nfurther into a vertical layout.\nSo I'm going to draw some more rectangles,\nand I'm just going to draw right here\nand style it a little bit and make it\nred to represent the vertical layout.\nSo copy and paste,\nand I'm just going to move it down here.\nOkay. Okay,\nso that's two copy and paste\nto get three.\nSo it doesn't have to be perfect.\nIt's just here to help us\nvisualize the design. All right,\nso we have a horizontal layout, and\nthen inside we have a vertical layout.\nAnd now looking at this, we can also\nbreak this down into a horizontal layout.\nLet's draw some more rectangles. Actually,\nI'm going to just copy\nthis one and paste it and\nresize it here. So I'm going\nto break this down further\ninto a horizontal inside here.\nAnd finally, we can break this part\ndown further into a horizontal layout.\nSo let's copy this\nagain and paste it here.\nAnd I'm just going to\ncreate a few of them\nLike this.\nSo just like that,\nwe broke down this design into a\ncombination of vertical and horizontal\nlayouts using the nested\nlayouts technique.\nSo now that we have a good\nunderstanding of how this works,\nwe're going to learn how to\nrecreate this using code.\nSo let's go back into our project.\nI'm going to delete all\nthese extra tabs here.\nSo we're going to go from something that\nlooks like this to something that looks\nlike our final design\nhere. Now, before we start,\nwe actually need to download\nthis channel profile picture.\nSo remember to do that, we\ncan right click and inspect,\nclick the top left icon here,\nand then click this picture.\nAnd we have the URL to download it\nhere. So I'm going to hover over it,\nscroll down and click this\nlink. Now, control S to save.\nAnd I'm going to save it in the\nfolder that contains our code,\nwhich is right here.\nAnd now this should show\nup in our code editor.\nSo I'm actually going to create a folder\nto store all of these channel profile\npictures since we're going\nto have a lot of them.\nSo I'm going to call this\nchannel dash pictures,\nAnd I'll put this in there.\nNow we're ready to create our layouts.\nSo let's go back to our final design\nand see what kind of layouts we have.\nSo we're going to have a vertical\nlayout, that's one and two,\nso two rows. And then\ninside the second row,\nwe're going to have a horizontal\nlayout, which is one and two.\nNow, inside the second horizontal layout,\nwe're going to have a vertical\nlayout one, two, and three.\nSo that's how we're going to\nbreak down this design. And again,\ndon't worry about the video time here.\nWe're going to recreate\nthis later in the course.\nLet's go into our code and\nwe're going to implement that.\nSo make sure that we have our\nproject open on the left here.\nAnd we're going to start by\ncreating some vertical layouts.\nTo create a vertical layout.\nWe're going to create two divs.\nSo this is going to be\nour vertical layout.\nNow remember that divs are\nblock elements by default,\nso they're going to take up the entire\nline and appear one on top of another.\nAnd that's exactly what we\nwant for a vertical layout.\nSo let's look at our design. Here.\nWe have the image in the first row.\nSo I'm going to move\nthis up, Cut and paste.\nAnd then in the second row\nwe have everything else.\nSo I'm going to put everything\nhere in the second row.\nSo cut and paste.\nLet's save it and refresh.\nNow we're going to create a\nhorizontal layout down here.\nOne column's going to have\nthe channel profile picture,\nand the other column is\ngoing to have the text.\nLet's create the channel\nprofile picture. First,\nwe're going to create an image element.\nWe're going to give it the source\nOf the picture that we\ndownloaded in the beginning.\nSo that picture is in this folder. So\nwe're going to go into this folder first,\nwhich is channel dash pictures.\nAnd then remember to have a\nslash to go into that folder.\nAnd then channel one jpeg, save it.\nAnd now if we look at our current website,\nthe image is actually in its own row,\nand that's because the\nparagraph is a block element,\nso it has to appear on its own line.\nWe're going to change this by creating\na horizontal layout, like one and two.\nSo to do that, we're going to\ncreate two divs. Here's one diviv,\nand here is another diviv.\nNow the difference here is that we're\ngoing to make these divs inline block\nelements.\nSo remember that inline block is what\nallows elements to appear beside each\nother like this,\nwhile block elements force the element\nto take up the entire line so they will\nappear vertically.\nSo we're going to make these two divs\ninline block elements to create our\nhorizontal layout. Let's reference\nour design first. In the first column,\nwe have the channel profile picture.\nSo I'm just going to move this\nInto the first diviv here.\nAnd then in the second diviv,\nwe have all the text. So I'm going\nto move all of the text here,\ncut and paste.\nNow let's make these divs inline blocks\nso that they appear next to each other.\nI'm going to give a class so\nthat we can target it with css.\nLet's call this the channel picture.\nAnd then we're also going to give a class\nto this div so that we can target it.\nLet's call this the video dash info.\nAnd now in our css,\nwe're going to make the channel picture\npicture display in line dash block.\nAnd we're also going to make the\nvideo info display inline block.\nSo they appear next to\neach other video dash info\ndisplay in line block,\nsave it and refresh.\nNow you'll notice that they're\nstill on top of each other,\nand that's because divs by default\nhave a width of a hundred percent.\nSo we need to decrease the width of these\ntwo divs so that they appear next to\neach other. So remember that for the\nvideo preview card. So this whole thing,\nwe set the diviv to 300 pixels,\nand that's how they can\nappear beside each other.\nSo we're going to do the same thing\nfor our horizontal layout down here\nfor the channel picture,\nlet's set a width of 50 pixels.\nAnd then for the video info,\nwe're going to set a width to 200 pixels.\nSo this is the first column\nof our horizontal layout.\nIt's going to take up 50\npixels like this, and then\nthis is the second column.\nIt's going to take up 200 pixels.\nIt's going to appear beside the first\ncolumn because both of them are display\ninline block. So let's save this,\nand you'll notice it looks really weird.\nSo let's look at our code\nand see what the problem is.\nI'm going to scroll up here,\nand you'll notice that we set\nthe width of the video title,\nwhich is this text to 300. So\nwe're forcing it to overflow here,\nand that's not what we want.\nSo we just need to remove this\nand not force the width.\nSo if we don't force a width of 300,\nthe paragraph will just take up\nthe entire space of the container,\nwhich is 200 pixels.\nNow the second thing we notice is\nthat this image is overflowing,\nand that's because images by default,\nthey overflow.\nSo they keep their original dimensions,\nso they keep their original size\nand that causes them to overflow.\nSo we want to resize this image so\nthat it only takes up 50 pixels.\nLet's go ahead and do that right now.\nLet's give it a class so\nthat we can resize it.\nAnd I'm going to call this\nthe profile dash picture.\nAnd then I'll scroll up\nhere dot profile dash\npicture.\nAnd then I'm going to resize the\nwidth to 50 pixels so that it\nfits exactly this\ncolumn. Going to save it.\nAnd now that looks pretty good.\nWe can actually see the layout\nin our browser by right clicking\ninspect and finding this html.\nSo I can click this top left\nicon and just click this picture.\nSo I'll show you what it\nlooks like in the html.\nSo here we have a vertical\nlayout, so one and two,\nand then here we have\nhorizontal layout one and two.\nNow, a better way to do this is actually\nto set this to a hundred percent.\nSo this means the image will take up\nthe entire space of its container.\nSo if we look at our html, this\nimage is inside this container.\nIf we set it to a hundred percent, it'll\ntake up the space in the container,\nwhich is basically the 50 pixels\nthat we have here. Let's save it.\nNext. Remember that we've seen this\nproblem before, they're not aligned.\nSo we're going to align this\ninline block element to the top.\nTo do that, we're going\nto use this property here,\nvertical align top that we've seen before.\nSo vertical dash, align, top,\nsave it. All right, so we're almost there,\nbut notice that these two aren't aligned.\nThis paragraph has some margin at the top.\nRemember that paragraphs by default\ncome with margin at the top and at the\nbottom.\nSo we're going to go into our code and\nwe're going to get rid of this margin at\nthe top. So let's scroll up. Oh,\nso we actually deleted that style.\nSo let's create a new style here.\nWe're going to target\nthe video dash title.\nWe're going to target the\nclass video dash title,\nset the margin dash top two zero,\nand that's going to\neliminate the space up here.\nSo I'm going to pause here because we've\nactually created the nested layout that\nwe need. Let's look into our\nH T M L in the dev tools.\nAnd if we look at this video preview,\nwe have a vertical layout one and two.\nInside the vertical layout, we have\na horizontal layout one and two.\nAnd then inside our horizontal layout,\nwe have another vertical layout,\n1, 2, 3.\nSo that's a practical example of using\nthe nested layout technique to create a\nlayout that's a similar shape to this.\nThe only thing that's left to do\nis to style our website with CSS\none by one until it looks like this.\nSo we're going to do that right now.\nSo let's go into our code, and we're\ngoing to style these elements one by one.\nSo I'm actually going to move this down\nhere so that I can see it a lot easier.\nSo the first thing I noticed\nis that the image is round.\nSo remember to create a round\nimage or round anything,\nwe're going to use rounded corners.\nSo we're going to set\nthe border dash radius to\nlet's say 20 pixels. Save it.\nSo we have rounded corners,\nand it's getting more round,\nbut it's not a full circle yet.\nSo let's set this to maybe 50 pixels.\nSo now it looks a little too big.\nLet's set the width to\nsomething like 40 pixels.\nI think that looks pretty close and\nwe can always change it later. Next,\nthere's some spacing between the\nfirst row and the second row.\nSo let's go in here. I'm\ngoing to set a class here.\nCall this the thumbnail dash row.\nAnd then we're going to\nstyle this thumbnail row.\nAnd remember to add spacing\nto the bottom, we add margin\ndash bottom, and let's add\na margin of maybe 10 pixels.\nSave it. Okay, maybe 12 pixels.\nOkay, so that looks good enough.\nAnd finally, we can style the text.\nSo this YouTube project is actually\nusing the Google font called reto.\nWe learned in a previous lesson how to\nload Google fonts and in particular,\nhow to load robo. So we're\ngoing to do that again.\nLet's go to a new tab.\nWe're going to search for Google fonts,\nand we're going to load reto onto our\npage. So if you don't have this here,\nthis is from my previous session,\nwe can actually search for robo\nand then just open it here. And then\nwe select these styles that we want.\nSo I'm going to get the regular style,\nand then this seems like a bolded font.\nSo I'm going to get the medium\nfont and the bold font just in\ncase. So I'm going to go up\nto see the styles I selected.\nAnd then that looks pretty good.\nAnd Google will give me the code that\nI need to load this onto my website.\nSo I'm going to copy this\nand just paste it into my head section.\nSo right in between here. All right,\nso now I loaded the robo font, and\nwe're going to use it in our page.\nSo we're going to target all\nparagraphs and we're going\nto change their font family to reto.\nAnd we're also going to use a backup\nfont with this comma of aerial.\nSo this syntax here with a\ncomma is called a font stack.\nThis basically lets us\nset up a backup font.\nIf for whatever reason Reto\nfails to load from Google,\nthen it will fall back to our\nbackup font, which is aerial,\nsave it. Next,\nI'm going to change the size of the font.\nSo let's change the video title to maybe\n14 pixels. Save it. Okay,\nI think that looks pretty good.\nNext, I'm going to make it bold.\nSo font dash weight bold,\nsave it.\nSo this looks like it's a little\nbit too bold compared to this font.\nSo I'm actually going to\nchange this valley to 500.\nSo if you recall, we actually\nselected three styles of fonts,\nthe irregular 400,\nmedium, 500, and bold 700.\nSo when we set the font weight to bold,\nit actually corresponds to a number,\nwhich is 700. A regular\nfont weight is 400,\nand a semi bold is 500.\nSo usually we use the number value\nbecause it's a little more precise.\nSo usually instead of\ntyping font weight bold,\nwe wouldn't use font\nweight 700. In our case,\nour font is a little too bold, so\nwe're going to decrease this to 500,\nwhich is the medium size that\nwe picked on Google fonts.\nSo let's save this. And\nthat looks pretty close.\nNext, we're going to change\nthe space between the lines.\nSo remember the property to do\nthat, it's called line height.\nAnd let's try 14 pixels.\nThat's not enough,\nmaybe 20 pixels. All right,\nso I think that looks pretty\ngood and close to our design.\nYou might notice that the text here is\nshorter than what we have in the design.\nYou may or may not see this because this\ntext actually depends on the size of\nthe webpage. So depending\non how wide your webpage is,\nthe length of this text will\nchange. And in our current website,\nwe actually haven't\nimplemented this resizing,\nso we are going to fix this later. Next,\nI'm going to style this paragraph.\nSo let's go into our HTML here\nand look at the class name.\nSo it's the video author,\nand it looks like we don't\nhave any styles for that yet.\nSo I'm going to write it down here.\nSo we're going to style the\nclass video dash author.\nThe first thing I notice is the\nfont size. So it's a lot smaller.\nSo font dash size. Let's try 12\npixels. Let's see how that looks.\nOkay, so I think that looks pretty close.\nAnd we're going to change the color.\nColor. Now remember to get an exact color,\nwe can right click inspect spec,\nand then click this top\nleft icon. Click this text,\ngo to the computer tab.\nAnd if we scroll down,\nwe should get the text color right here.\nSo RGB 96, 96, 96, save that.\nAnd if we go back,\nokay, that looks perfect. Next,\nI'm going to style this paragraph.\nSo in our code, this paragraph\nis called video dash stats,\nand I'm not sure if we have a style\nfor this. Doesn't look like we do.\nSo I'm going to write a new\none. so.video dash stats,\nwe're going to set the font size to\n12 pixels because these two look the\nsame. Okay,\nand then we're going to set the color\nas well since these two look the same.\nAnd now remember that whenever we have\nthese duplicate styles like this and\nthis, we can actually target\nmultiple classes by adding a comma.\nSo we're going to target the video\ndash author class as well as the video\ndash stats class.\nSo this is going to help us\nreduce duplication of our code.\nSo I'm going to delete these lines,\nsave it, everything looks okay.\nAnd the last thing we're going to modify\nis the spacing between the paragraphs.\nSo remember that paragraphs by default\ncome with margin at the top and at the\nbottom. Now, instead of\nremoving them individually,\nI'm actually going to go up to the top\nof our page. So we did this once before.\nWe're going to get rid of the default\nmargin for all paragraphs on the page.\nSo to do that,\nwe're going to go into these styles and\nwe're going to set the margin dash top\nto zero.\nAnd we're also going to set\nthe margin dash bottom two\nzero. And this will get rid of\nall the default margins. Save it.\nAnd now we can set a more precise\nmargin at the bottom here.\nSo under the video title,\nlet's set a margin bottom of maybe 15\npixels. Save it. Okay, looks\nlike it's a little too much,\nmaybe 12 pixels. Okay,\nI think that looks pretty good.\nAnd now under the video author,\nwe're going to add some margin.\nSo currently we have some styles\nthat apply to both of these.\nI'm going to target.video\ndash author individually down\nhere. So for the video author,\nI'm going to add a margin dash bottom\nof maybe six pixels, save it,\nand maybe four pixels. Okay,\nso I think that looks pretty close.\nAnd now if we look at our website,\nyou can tell that it's actually really\nclose to the final design that we have\nnow to finish off the second\nvideo preview you have a choice.\nYou can either do everything that we did\nin the code here to give yourself more\npractice or if you want to save time\nand move on to the next section,\nwe can just copy all of this\nHTML and replace this part here\nAnd then just swap out the thumbnail\nas well as the channel profile\npicture, which you'll need\nto download first from here,\nas well as swap out all of the text.\nSo I'm just going to fast forward this\nvideo to finish up this second video\npreview,\nbut feel free to pause it and try\nyourself to give yourself more practice.\nAnd there we go. In this lesson we\nlearn in the nested layouts technique,\nwhich is one of the most important\ntechniques for being able to break down a\ndesign that you see on a website\nand recreate it using code.\nIn this lesson we're going\nto learn about CSS grid,\nwhich is a much better way to create\nthese horizontal layouts as well as to\ncreate a grid like this that you\nsee in our final project. First,\nwe're going to open up the\nwebsite we were working on.\nSo I have it open right here.\nAnd remember that for\nour horizontal layouts,\nwe were creating them using something\ncalled display inline block.\nSo if we go into our\ncode and we scroll down,\nwe were using display inline\nblock and a width to put these two\nside by side.\nNow there are some problems with display\ninline block that I want to show you\nright now.\nWe're going to set the background\ncolor of these to gray,\nso this will make it easier\nto see what the problem is.\nNow let's save it.\nAnd now you can see that there's a\nlittle bit of space between these two,\nand this causes some alignment problems.\nSo the width of this entire\ncontainer here, the width here,\nwe set it to 300 pixels,\nbut we set the channel picture to 50\npixels here and the video info to 200.\nSo you would expect that we can actually\nset this to two 50 to take up the\nentire 300 pixels, but if I save it,\nyou can see that it's too long\nand it wraps to the next line.\nSo we have to set it to something\nlike 2 45 and that will cause it to\nappear beside each other.\nSo this is one problem with inline block\nis that it has some alignment problems.\nNow you might be wondering\nwhere this space is coming from.\nIf we scroll down to our html,\nwe can see that there's actually\nsome space between these two divs,\nand we learned earlier that H TML combines\nmultiple spaces together and that's\nwhat shows up here. So we could remove\nthis and save and get rid of that\nspace, but that means our\ncode is less easy to read.\nNow the second problem that inline block\nhas is that it's not vertically aligned\nlike you see here.\nSo now we're going to learn\na new technique called CSS\nGrid that's going to help\nus create perfectly aligned\nhorizontal layouts to learn grid.\nWe're going to create a new file where\nwe're just going to practice using grids.\nSo let's go into our code editor\nand we're going to create a new file\ncalled grid html.\nAnd remember, for every HTML file,\nwe want the proper structure.\nSo at the top we're\ngoing to have a doc type,\nand then we're going to\nhave an HTML element.\nAnd then inside we're going to\nhave a head element and a body\nelement. Now that we have\nthe proper structure,\nwe can open this file in live server.\nSo let's right click and\nopen with live server.\nAnd then let's set the title\nor the text in the tabs here\nto two grid practice\nso we know what this file\nis about. Let's save it.\nSo I'm going to resize my windows here\njust so we can see what's going on.\nWe're going to start off in the body\nand we're going to create a diviv.\nAnd then inside this diviv\nwe're going to create two divs.\nSo let's call this Diviv\none and let's call this\nDiviv two. Save it. And\nnow to help us learn,\nI'm actually going to show you\na new way of writing c s s.\nSo if we go to the opening tag here,\nwe can set a special attribute\ncalled a style attribute.\nNow the style attribute is unique\nbecause it lets us write CSS code inside.\nSo let's write the code\nbackground dash color light\nblue,\nAnd we save it.\nWe can see that these styles that we\nwrote here are applied to this element.\nSo this code here is another\nway of writing CSS called inline\nstyles. We're writing our\nCSS inside a line of html.\nWe've already learned two\nother ways of writing css.\nOne of them is the style element and the\nother is to put our CSS in a separate\nfile. This is a third way of writing css.\nNow generally we don't use this in Rio\nwebsites because it makes our HTML harder\nto read. In Rio websites, we put\nour styles in a separate file,\nbut for now, since we're learning, this\nis pretty useful because number one,\nit only affects the element\nwith the style attribute.\nAnd the other thing is that the\nCSS code is right beside our HTML\nso that when you go and\nreview this file later,\nit's very easy to see what's going on.\nSo let's practice with\nthe style attribute.\nWe're going to add another\none to this second div.\nSo let's set this style\nto background color,\nand we'll set a background\ncolor of light pink.\nLet's save it. And now we have the\ntwo divs we're going to work with.\nNow, currently we just have\ntwo divs inside another.\nThere's nothing new going on here, but\nnow we're going to create our first grid.\nSo what is a grid? A grid is a\nlayout that has rows and columns.\nFor example, this is a two by three grid.\nWe have two rows and three\ncolumns. This is a one by two grid.\nWe have one row and two columns.\nSo we're going to learn how to make\nthis kind of structure in our html.\nTo do that, we're going to style\nthis outer diviv or the container.\nSo let's see how that works. We're\ngoing to set a style attribute here.\nAnd to create a grid, we're\ngoing to need two steps.\nThe first step is to set\nthe display property,\nand we're going to set display to grid.\nThe second step is we need to set\nhow many columns our grid has.\nSo to do that we're going to use\nthis property grid dash template,\ndash columns,\nand we're going to give\nthis property two values,\n100 pixels and 100 pixels.\nSo these two values define\nhow wide our grid columns are.\nThe first column is going to\nhave a width of 100 pixels,\nand the second column is going to\nhave a width of 100 pixels as well.\nAnd our grid will have two\ncolumns. So if we save this,\nyou'll see that we created\nour first one by two grid.\nNow I want to point out a few\ncharacteristics of a grid. First of all,\nnotice that this diviv is no\nlonger taking up the entire line.\nSo recall that divs are\ndisplayed blocked by default.\nThey're supposed to\ntake up the entire line,\nbut when this element is inside a grid,\nit's actually placed into the grid,\nso it only takes up the\nentire column instead.\nThe second thing you'll notice is that\nthere's no extra space between these two,\nunlike with display inline block.\nAnd the third thing to\nnotice is that, for example,\nlet's add another element into\nthe second. Let's add a paragraph\nof text, save it when\nwe add more elements.\nThis makes the second taller than the\nfirst one, but they're vertically aligned,\nand that's another difference\nbetween grids and display.\nIn line block grids maintain\nalignment much better.\nAll right, so that is our basic grid.\nNow we're going to create\nanother grid to practice with.\nWe're going to go into our code,\nwe're going to copy all of this,\nand then we're going to paste it below.\nAnd it's a little bit\nweird, the formatting.\nSo we can select this and press\ntab to move it back into a normal\nposition. Let's save it. And\nnow we have our second grid,\nbut let's actually add some space to the\ntop so that we can see it more clearly.\nWe're going to add some\nmargin dash top of 30\npixels. Save it. Okay,\nthat looks pretty good.\nAnd this time we're going\nto add a third column.\nSo this property actually takes any\nnumber of values that you give it.\nSo if we add a third\nvalue here of 200 pixels,\nit's going to create a third\ncolumn that is 200 pixels wide.\nSo the number of values determine the\nnumber of columns and the value itself\ndetermines the width of the\ncolumn. So if we save it,\nwe do have three columns here,\nbut we only have two divs,\nso we need another div to fill\nout the third column. To do that,\nlet's copy our first diff,\nand then we're just going to paste\nit down here and call it div three.\nSo now we have three diffs to\nfill out the three columns,\nand you can see that our third column\nis 200 pixels versus 100 pixels that we\nsaw right here. So let's actually\nchange the text here so that we can\nsee what's going on. So\n100 pixels, 100 pixels,\nand 200 pixels. Save it.\nSo now let's see what happens when\nwe add another div to our grid here.\nSo let's copy this second\ndiviv and then duplicate it.\nCopy it and paste.\nCan actually get rid of this\nparagraph here and save it.\nAnd now you can see that this fourth\ndiviv wraps around to a second row.\nSo whenever we have more elements\nthan we have columns here,\nit starts to wrap around\nand create new rows.\nSo that's the basics of how grids work.\nNow I'm going to show you a special\nvalue that we can use with grids. First,\nlet's copy this and then create\na new grid to practice with\nspace it here. And then\nselect this and tab.\nAnd this time we're only\ngoing to have two columns.\nSo let's get rid of this third column.\nAnd let's only have two diffs here.\nAnd we can also get rid of\nthis paragraph. For this grid,\nwe're going to have two columns.\nThe first one is 100 pixels,\nand the second one, we're\ngoing to change it to one fr.\nSo FR is a special value in\ngrid that stands for free space.\nIt means to take up the remaining\namount of space on this grid.\nSo if I save it,\nyou can see that the first column here\nis 100 pixels and the second column\nhas a width of one fr.\nSo it takes up the remaining amount of\nspace that we have. If I resize the page,\nit'll take up the remaining amount of\nspace. So that's what one FR means.\nI'm going to change this to one fr so\nthat it's easier to see when we review\nthis file.\nSo this fr value is exactly what\nwe need in our final design.\nIf I open my final design,\nyou can see that we have\na horizontal layout here.\nThe first column is about 50 pixels,\nand we want the second column to take\nup the remaining amount of space,\nwhich is exactly what\nwe need, one FR four.\nNow before we go and update our project,\nI'm going to show you another\nproperty of this FR value.\nLet's copy on this diviv\nand create another grid\nbelow it.\nAnd this time we're going to add\na third column that is also one\nfr. And I'm going to add another\ndiviv to fill out this third column.\nLet's copy this and paste\nit into a third diviv.\nThis one is also going to be\none F fr. So let's save it here.\nAnd for this example, the second\ncolumn and the third column,\nboth have one ffr.\nSo one FFR tells the columns to take up\nthe remaining amount of space and the\nnumber in front of it tells us relatively\nhow much of the remaining space\nthis column gets. Since in this\nexample, both of them are one,\nthey'll get an equal amount\nof the remaining space.\nSo here these two are equal and\nthey take up the remaining space.\nIf we change the third column to two fr,\nso let's change this to two fr and save.\nThe second and third column will\ntake up the remaining space,\nbut the third column will be twice\nas wide as the second column.\nSo this number here is\nsort of like a ratio.\nThis second column will have a\none-third of the remaining space,\nand this third column will have\ntwo thirds of the remaining space.\nNow that we understand that concept,\nwe're going to go back into our project\nand use grids to create this horizontal\nlayout instead of inline block.\nLet's go to our code and we're\ngoing to scroll down into the\nH T M L for this which is right here,\nand I'm going to collapse\nit so it's easier to see.\nWe have the channel picture and\nthe video info, which is these two.\nSo to create a grid, remember we\nneed to create it on the container,\nwhich is this diviv.\nSo let's set a class\nname video dash info dash\ngrid, and then we'll target\nthis class in our CSS above.\nGoing to scroll up, and I'm going\nto actually put it right here,\nvideo dash info dash grid,\nbecause this is right above the\nchannel picture and the video info.\nSo it's beside other related\nstyles. Now remember,\nto create a grid, we need two steps.\nThe first one is to set the\ndisplay property to grid.\nThis creates our grid, and then we need\nto set how many columns our grid has.\nSo we're going to set grid\ndash template, dash columns.\nAnd for our purposes,\nlet's set a column of 50 pixels\nfor the channel profile picture.\nAnd then we want the second column to\ntake up the remaining amount of space.\nSo as we learn, that is\none fr. Now if we save it,\nyou'll notice that the space between the\ninline blocks is gone. So unlike here,\nand you'll also notice that\nthese two are vertically aligned.\nSo now that we have our grid,\nwe can actually remove all of these inline\nblock styles because we're not using\nthem anymore. So we can\nactually remove all of these\nand all of these. Let's save it.\nAnd now let's set a grid for\nthe second video preview.\nWe're going to scroll down.\nSo remember we're going to set\nthe styles on the container here,\nand then these two divs are\ngoing to appear in our grid.\nSo we've already created\nthis CSS at the top.\nWe just need to set a class\nof video, dash info dash grid,\nsave it,\nand then all the styles that we\nwrote up here will target that class.\nSo now we have both of our grids and\nyou can see our horizontal layout is\nperfectly aligned with\nthe rest of our layout.\nAnd now we can remove\nthis background color\nand this part of the project is done.\nThe last thing we're going to learn about\ngrids is if we go to our final design,\nwe're going to learn how to\nbuild a bigger grid like this. So\nnotice that there's a little bit of\nspacing between the columns as well as\nbetween the rows. Now before we start,\nyou might have a bigger screen and\nyou might see four videos in each row.\nSo for now,\nlet's actually resize the browser so\nthat we see three videos in each row.\nSo I'm doing this because not everyone\nhas a big screen to work with,\nand this will make sure that\neveryone can follow along.\nSo I'm going to zoom back in and just\nmake sure I have three videos in each row.\nAnd we're going to learn how\nto create this kind of layout.\nLet's go into our grid practice file,\nand we'll go back into our code\nagain and into our grid html file,\nand we're going to create\nanother grid to practice with.\nSo let's copy this and then\njust paste it down here.\nAnd now for this example,\nlet's look at our final design.\nWe essentially want three\ncolumns of equal size.\nAnd when we resize the page, notice\nthat the columns resize as well.\nSo notice that if I resize too\nmuch, it becomes two columns.\nWe're going to deal with\nthis later in the course.\nWe're not going to deal with that.\nWe're just going to deal with\nthree columns that we have here.\nSo for this layout, we want\nsomething like one F fr, one F fr,\nand one FFR to divide this space evenly.\nLet's go into our file here and\nwe're going to set three columns,\none F fr, one F fr, and one ffr.\nSo this will create three equal\ncolumns that will resize with the page.\nLet's set this to one FFR as well\nso that it's clear what's going on.\nLet's save it.\nAnd now we have the three columns\nwe're going to be working with.\nLet's also set the height so that\nit looks a little bit like our video\npreviews that we have here.\nSo let's go into our HTM file\nand we're going to set the height\nto 200 pixels.\nAnd let's also set the height\nof these other columns as well.\n200 pixels and 200 save it. Okay,\nso that looks pretty good, but\nthey're a little bit too much.\nAt the bottom of the page,\nwe're going to add some spacing at the\nbottom of the website so that we can\nscroll these up.\nLet's go back up into our HTML and\nwe're going to scroll up to the body\ntag.\nWe're actually going to add some spacing\ninside the bottom of the body tag.\nSo remember that spacing on\nthe inside is called padding.\nSo padding dash bottom.\nAnd let's set it to something\nlike a thousand pixels. So it's\na lot easier for us to practice.\nSo now that we have a lot of space at\nthe bottom, we can scroll all the way up\nand see our grid clearly.\nSo remember that in a grid, if we have\nmore elements, then we have columns,\nit'll start wrapping\naround to the second row.\nSo all we had to do is add three\nmore divs. So we're just going to,\nlet's actually copy the pink one first.\nLet's copy it and paste it,\nand then we'll add a blue and a\npink at the bottom. So let's copy\nand paste it.\nSo we just need six divs to work with\nthat have alternating colors like this.\nSo let's save it.\nAnd now we essentially have our\nvideo preview that we see here,\nand we're going to learn how to create\nthese space between the columns and the\nrows. So it's actually really\neasy to create this space.\nWe just need two CSS properties.\nThe first one is called column dash gap.\nSo it's pretty straightforward\nwhat this means.\nWe're setting some space or\na gap between the columns.\nSo let's set a column gap of 20 pixels.\nLet's see how that looks. Save it.\nAnd now all of our columns have a\ngap, just like our final design here.\nNext we're going to set the space\nbetween the rows and we have\na similar and straightforward\nproperty for that called row dash cap.\nAnd let's set this to something\nlike 40 pixels, save it.\nAnd now we have space between the\nrows, just like our final design.\nSo that's how we create a grid like this.\nFirst we define our three\ncolumns. So in this case,\nwe want to divide it up into three\nequal columns that resize with the page.\nThat's why we used one\nffr, one ffr, one ffr.\nAnd then we just add some space\nbetween the columns using column gap,\nwhich creates this. And we add space\nbetween the rows using row gap,\nwhich creates this.\nLet's go back into our website we were\nworking on and we're going to apply these\nskills to here. Let's go back here.\nWe're going to scroll\ndown. And first of all,\nlet's just create six of these video\npreviews so we can organize them into a\ngrid that looks like this,\ntwo rows and three columns.\nSo we're going to go into a code and\nwe're going to copy both of these\nand we're just going to make duplicates.\nSo copy it and paste it.\nSo now if we save, we have four\nand we're going to create two more.\nSo paste it again, save.\nAnd now we have six.\nSo remember to create a\ngrid, we need a container.\nSo we need a container for\nall of these video previews.\nSo let's create a diviv, and this\nis going to be our container.\nWe're going to call this\nthe video dash grid.\nAnd now let's move all of these\nvideo previews inside our new grid.\nJust going to move all of them,\ncut it and paste it in here.\nLet's save it. Scroll back up.\nAnd now to create the grid,\nwe want to set styles on\nthis container element.\nSo let's go into our css.\nWe're going to target the video dash grid.\nAnd remember we have two steps.\nThe first step is to\nset the display to grid,\nand the second step is to set how\nmany columns we have grid dash\ntemplate, dash columns,\nand for our example,\nwe want three equal columns\nthat take up the entire space.\nSo let's set one fr, one fr and one fr.\nNow if we look at our page, we now\nhave the three columns in our grid,\nbut you might notice that\nif I resize this down,\nit actually doesn't resize with the page.\nSo the reason this happens is\nbecause if we go and scroll up,\nwe set a width on the video preview,\nwhich sort of forces the width to be\n300 pixels and earlier we also set\nthe width of the thumbnail to 300.\nSo instead of setting the width like\nthis, which will force the width,\nwe actually just want these elements\nto take up all the space in the columns\nthat they're inside of. So to do that,\nwe can remove this property\nhere and let's save it.\nAnd for images,\na weird behavior is that they always\nkeep their original size to get them to\nfit inside their container or inside\nthe column of the grid. We have\nto set a width of a\nhundred percent save it,\nand now they'll only take up a hundred\npercent of their container. Now,\nwe also don't need the\ndisplay block here anymore,\nso this image is taking up a hundred\npercent. It's already on its own line,\nso display block is not\nnecessary. So let's delete that.\nAnd now we're going to deal with\nthis video preview with for this,\nwe can just get rid of the with\nhere and the display inline block\nand also vertical line, which\nrelates to inline block.\nAnd we can get rid of the margin since\nwe're going to create this space using\nthe column gap property\nwe learned earlier.\nSo let's just get rid of all of\nthese styles. And now if we save,\nwe can now see that our video previews\nare fitting perfectly inside of our grid.\nThe final step is we're going to add some\nspace to the columns and to the rows.\nSo let's go into our CSS here.\nAnd remember the two properties,\nthey're pretty straightforward\nare column dash gap,\nand let's set a column gap\nof maybe 15 pixels. Save it.\nOkay, let's compare that to our design,\nand I'm going to resize it a little bit.\nSo I think this looks pretty\nclose to what we have,\nmaybe 16 pixels.\nAnd then we're going to set a row gap.\nLet's set a row dash gap of maybe 40,\nsave it and compare it to our design.\nSo I think that looks pretty\nclose to what we have now,\nthe design might look\na little bit smaller,\nand that's because we\nhave the sidebar here,\nbut we're going to deal with that\nin a later lesson. So for now,\nthis looks perfect.\nThe last thing we're going to do\nis to swap out the thumbnails,\nthe channel profile pictures as well\nas the rest of the text to match our\ndesign. So I'll let you get some\npractice doing that. Remember,\nyou'll have to download the thumbnail\nand the channel profile picture first.\nFor now,\nlet's just do six of these videos and\nthen we can add the rest of them at the\nend of the course.\nSo pause the video right now\nand swap out all the thumbnails,\nthe channel pictures and the text, and\nI'll see you back after you've done that.\nSo this is what it looks like\nafter I swapped everything out.\nSo that's the end of this lesson.\nWe learned about CSS grid,\nwhich is a great way to create these\nhorizontal layouts that are perfectly\naligned and to create this\nbigger grid that we see here.\nHere's some exercises to get\nyourself familiar with grids.\nIn this lesson we're going\nto learn about Flexbox,\nwhich is another way to create layouts.\nAnd we're going to use Flexbox to create\nthe header at the top of the page.\nSo Flexbox is similar to CSS Grid. It\ncan create the same kind of layouts,\nbut it's more flexible just\nlike the previous lesson.\nLet's go into our code and create a\nnew file just to practice Flex Box.\nWe're going to create a new file by\nclicking this icon and let's call it\nflex box dot html. And remember,\nwe always start with the HTML structure.\nWe're going to have a doc type\nat the top and then an HTML\nelement,\na head element and a body element.\nLet's save it. And now we\ncan open this in live server.\nSo right click and open with live server.\nNow in this lesson we're also going to\ncompare Flexbox to grid to show what\nthese similarities and differences are.\nSo we're also going to go into our code\nand open the grid dot html from the\nprevious lesson. And we're also\ngoing to open this in live server.\nSo right click and open with live server.\nJust going to move these beside\neach other and resize the page.\nAnd now we're ready to begin.\nSo we're going to start off\nin our flexbox dot html.\nAnd first we're going to go into the\nhead section and we're going to add a\ntitle.\nLet's call this flex box\npractice and then save.\nSo this is just going to remind us that\nthis file is for flex box practice and\nit's going to show up here.\nNext we're going to go into the body\nand start creating some flex boxes.\nSo just like for grid, we're\ngoing to create a diviv,\nand inside we're going to have two divs,\nso diviv one and Diviv two.\nSo we're going to use inline CSS again\njust like we did for grid like here,\nso that we keep our CSS\ncode close to our HTML code,\nand it'll be easier to understand what's\ngoing on when we review this file in\nthe future. So insider diviv set a style.\nAnd for this div we're going to set\nthe background color to light blue like\nbefore. And then for the second diviv,\nwe'll also set it to light pink.\nSo style equals background, dash color,\nlight pink, save it.\nAnd now we have the two divs we can\nwork with. So just like with grid,\nFlexbox requires a container\nor this outer diviv.\nThis container is going\nto be the flex box.\nAnd then these elements are going\nto be placed into our flex box.\nSo now let's learn how to turn\nour container into a flex box.\nWe're going to set a style here\nand we're going to do two steps.\nThe first one is to set the\ndisplay property to flex.\nThis creates a flex\nbox. In the second step,\nwe're going to set the\nflex dash direction to row.\nThis means we're going to align these\nelements horizontally in a horizontal\nlayout.\nSo now let's save this file and we\ncan see the effect that Flexbox has.\nSo inside of Flexbox, these\ndivs, which are block elements,\ndon't behave like block elements anymore.\nThey behave more like\ninline block elements.\nThey only take up as much\nhorizontal space as they need to.\nNow compare that to grid where we\nfirst set the columns and then the\nelements went inside the columns. So the\nlayout is a little more rigid for grid.\nIf we go back to our flex box,\nif we add some more text to\nthis first diviv and save\nnotice that it expands to take\nup as much space as it needs to.\nSo this is a flexible box and\nthat's why we call it flex box.\nNow there's one other thing I want to\npoint out about flex box is that if we\nmake this second diviv taller,\njust like our grid example here,\nthe flex box will be vertically aligned.\nLet's go into our code and let's\nadd a paragraph to make this diviv\ntaller. If I save it, you'll\nsee that it got taller,\nbut we still maintain vertical alignment.\nSo flexbox is another way to create these\nhorizontal layouts while maintaining\nalignment. All right,\nlet's go through some more examples to\nsee these similarities and differences\nbetween flex box and grid. We'll\nstart with these similarities. First,\nwe'll go into our code and we're going\nto create another flex box to practice\nwith. So we'll just copy this\nand then paste it down here.\nI'm going to select this and\npress tab. I'll scroll down.\nSo we'll also add some spacing to the\ntop of this because we want to make it\neasier to separate.\nSo let's add some margin\ndash top of 30 pixels,\nsave it. That looks pretty good.\nAnd now for this first diviv,\nwe're going to set the\nwidth to 100 pixels.\nSo I'm just going to organize my CSS a\nlittle bit here and we're going to set\nthe width to 100 pixels and let's also\nchange the text to 100 pixels so that\nwe know what's going on. So let's\nsave it.\nSo now our first flex box\nelement is 100 pixels wide.\nFor the second diviv,\nwe're going to tell it to take\nup the remaining amount of space.\nSo if you remember from grid,\nthat's equivalent to one fr,\nwe're going to learn how to do that in\nflex box. So for this one in our code,\nwe're going to add a new\nstyle and we're going to add a\nstyle specific to flex box called flex.\nAnd we're going to set this to one.\nAnd we're also going to\nchange this text here to flex\none. Let's save it.\nAnd now we can see that flex one causes\nthis diviv to take up the remaining\namount of space.\nSo Flex one is the flex box\nequivalent to one FR in grid.\nSo let's go through another example.\nWe're going to copy this\nand then paste it again.\nAnd for this example, we're going to\nadd another diviv to the bottom here.\nSo let's copy this first diviv,\ncopy it and paste so that\nwe have alternating colors.\nAnd then we're going to set the\nflex on the second diviv to flex\ntwo. And let's change\nthe text to flex two.\nSo you can see that flex two is\nthe equivalent of two FR and grid.\nSo two items that both have flex are\ngoing to take up the remaining amount of\nspace.\nBut this number here tells us relatively\nhow much of the remaining space it\ntakes.\nSo this element with flex two is going\nto take twice the amount of the remaining\nas this element with flex one.\nSo the value here works the\nsame as E value with fr.\nSo you can see that the basic things\nthat we do with the grid we can also do\nwith flex box. Now let's\ntalk about the differences.\nSo if we go to our grid examples and\nwe look at that, this example here,\nthe layout is more rigid for grid.\nIf we go into our grid code and\nwe scroll down to this example,\nwhich is right here, one FFR and two ffr,\nyou'll see that we first define three\ncolumns and then these elements go into\nthose columns.\nSo if I move this element to the second\nposition, so I'm just going\nto cut and move it down here.\nThis item is now going to go into the\nsecond column and it's going to take up\none FR of space, even though\nwe wrote 100 pixels here.\nSo if I save this,\nyou'll see that this one FR element\ngoes into the 100 pixel column.\nSo it only takes up a\nhundred pixels of space.\nAnd the layout here is not\nchanging for flex box. However,\nif we go to our flex box\nexample and our code,\nif we change the order of the elements,\nso let's cut this and paste\nit down here, save it.\nYou'll notice that the\nlayout actually changes.\nSo this element here actually\nkeeps its width of flex one,\nand then the second element keeps\nits width of a hundred pixels.\nSo the elements take their width\nalong with them if they move around,\nand that causes us to have flexible\nlayouts depending on how many elements we\nhave and what order they're in.\nSo that's the biggest difference between\nflex box and grid.\nSo what's the advantage of having\na flexible layout like this?\nLet's go to our final project and\nwe're going to resize the browser.\nAnd you'll notice that in the header in\nthe right section we have four icons or\nimages. Now we could create this\nhorizontal layout using a grid.\nHowever, when we're locked out of YouTube,\nyou'll notice that we\nonly have three icons.\nSo the layout actually changes because\nwe only have three elements now.\nSo this would be a great situation to\nuse flex box instead of grid when we want\na flexible layout\ndependent on our content.\nSo that's the basics of how Flexbox\nworks to create layouts and the main\ndifference between Flexbox and grid.\nWe're going to go back to our practice\nfile and we're going to go through some\nother examples of Flexbox to help us\nbuild the header of our final project.\nSo first,\nlet's actually save this as it is\nso that we get a reminder that the\nlayout is flexible.\nI'm going to change this to light blue\nand the other one to light pink so that\nwe have alternating colors\nand it's easier to see.\nAll right, let's go\nback into our grid coat,\nand we're also going to move this\nback into its original position.\nSo just to remind us that for\ngrid, the layout is more rigid,\nlet's save it. And now we're back.\nSo we'll go back to our Flexbox\nfile and our flex box html,\nand we're going to do another example.\nSo let's copy this and we're going\nto create another flex box to\npractice with.\nNow for these next examples,\nwe're going to use them to learn how\nto create the header up here. So first,\nlet's create something\nthat looks like the header.\nWe're going to create a box\nthat has roughly the same shape.\nSo we'll go into our file here and we're\ngoing to make this flex box have the\nsame shape as a header.\nSo let's set the height\nto 70 pixels and let's\nset a border so that we\ncan see the actual box.\nSo we're going to set a\nborder width of one pixel,\na border style of a solid color,\nand we'll set the border color\nto gray. And when we save it,\nwe can now see our flex\nbox using the border.\nI'm going to add a little bit of spacing\nto the bottom of the page here so that\nwe can scroll this up.\nSo remember to do that,\nwe're going to scroll up and add some\npadding to the bottom of the body.\nWe're going to add a style to the body,\nand we're going to add\nsome space to the bottom.\nSo padding bottom 1000 pixels,\nand now we can scroll this flex box up\nto the top so that it's easier to work\nwith. Now let's scroll back down to\nthe example we were working with,\nwhich is right here. So\nfor each of these divs,\nlet's change the width to 100 pixels.\nSo I'll change this one to 100 pixels,\nand let's also change\nthe text to 100 pixels\nfor this one's also 100 pixels\nand the third one to 100 pixels.\nNow let's save it. And we\nhave our three divs here.\nSo notice that these three divs\nare aligned to the left side,\nso we can actually change how they\nare aligned horizontally. To do that,\nwe're going to use a flex box\nproperty called justify dash content.\nSo this determines how these elements\nare laid out horizontally. For example,\nthe default value is start. If we save it,\nthey'll be aligned to the\nstart or the left side.\nIf we change this to end now,\nthey will be aligned to\nthe end or the right side.\nWe can also change this to center\nto put all of our elements in the\ncenter. So that's how we control how these\nelements are positioned horizontally.\nWe're going to go through\nanother example here.\nWe're going to copy this whole flex box\nand we're going to create another one\nbelow it. Let's copy it and paste it.\nAnd for this one we're going\nto set a special value of space\ndash between.\nSo what space between does is that it\nspreads out our elements evenly across\nthis horizontal space and to make sure\nthat there's equal amount of space\nbetween each element.\nSo this is really useful if we\ngo back to our header to spread\nout these four icons evenly.\nNow the last example we're going to go\nthrough for flex box is how to align\nelements vertically. So let's copy\nthis again and create another flex box.\nSo let's copy this, paste it down here.\nAnd for this one we're going\nto set another flex box\nproperty called align dash\nitems. So this determines how these\nelements are aligned vertically.\nThe default value is stretch,\nwhich you can see here the elements\nare stretching to fill up the vertical\nspace, but we also have some options.\nWe can align them to the start,\nso they will no longer\nstretch to the vertical space.\nThey will just take up as much\nvertical space as they need to,\nand they will be placed at the\ntop or we can put them at the end,\nwhich will place them at the bottom of\nthe container and we can put them in\nthe center,\nwhich will place them vertically\ncentered. If we look at our final project,\nagain,\nyou'll notice that all of these things\nin the header are vertically centered.\nSo now we learned all these skills that\nwe need and we're ready to build the\nheader for our project.\nLet's go to the code for our\nproject we were working on,\nwhich was YouTube dot html. And make\nsure you have this open in your browser.\nI'm going to resize the window here\nand also the code editor so that it's\neasier to see what's going on. As we code,\nWe're first going to create an element\nat the top to represent our header.\nSo let's scroll down. And currently\nall we have is this input.\nSo we're going to create a new diviv\nand we're going to give\nit a class of header.\nSo this diviv is going to represent\nthe header in the final project.\nAnd now let's put our search\nbar into our new header.\nSo we'll cut this and paste it in here.\nNext. If we look at our final project,\nthe header has three sections.\nWe have a section on the left,\na middle section with the search bar and\nthe right section here with some icons.\nSo we're going to simplify this by first\ncreating these three sections and then\naligning them and then filling out these\nsections with the appropriate elements.\nSo let's go back down here and we're\ngoing to create three sections.\nSo we'll just use three divs here.\nSo let's call this class\nequals left dash section.\nWe'll create another diviv, we'll call\nit class equals middle dash section.\nWe'll create another div and\nwe'll give it a class of right\ndash section\nand we'll put the search bar into\nthe middle section Right here.\nAnd now let's style this diviv so that\nwe have roughly the same dimensions.\nSo before we do that,\nyou'll notice that we already have\na lot of CSS code in this file,\nand the best practice is actually\nto put the CSS in a separate file.\nSo before we write even more css,\nlet's go ahead and put\nthis into its own CSS file.\nSo we're actually going to\nhave multiple CSS files,\none file for styles of the video\npreview and another for every\nstyle of the header.\nSo let's actually create a new folder\nfirst to organize all of our different\nfiles of css. So we'll create a new\nfolder and let's just call this styles.\nInside we're going to\ncreate two CSS files.\nThe first one is going to\nbe called video dot css,\nand the second is going\nto be header dot css.\nSo first we're going to\ngo into our YouTube htl.\nWe're going to move all of this\ninto the video dot CSS file.\nSo let's move this into here.\nNow all these styles for these videos\nare separated into their own file.\nNow if I scroll up to the top here,\nyou'll notice we also have\nsome styles for the header.\nSo this actually belongs in the header,\nand we're going to move this\ninto our header dot CSS file.\nSo we're grouping related styles\ntogether to make it easier to read. Now,\nfor the top of this file, again,\nwe have this code that targets\nall paragraphs on the page.\nSo this is not actually\nspecific to our videos.\nSo I'm actually going to create\nanother file called general\ndot css,\nand that's going to contain all\nthe general CSS code like this\nwhere we target all paragraph\nelements on the page.\nSo move this piece of code into general.\nSo just like that,\nwe have three CSS files and they're\nall very focused on one part\nof our webpage. So this is\ngenerally what we want to do.\nWe want to organize our code and separate\nthem into different files depending on\nwhat the code does. Next,\nwe're going to go into our HTML file and\nwe can remove this and let's save it.\nBut now you can see that all of\nthese styles that we had are gone,\nso we need to link them back\ninto our html. To do that,\nwe're going to create a link element.\nWe'll have an attribute of re,\nwhich tells it what we're linking.\nSo we're linking a style sheet and we\nalso tell it what file we're linking with\nhf. So here beside our HTML file,\nwe have a styles folder. So we're\ngoing to first link the styles folder,\nand then we're going to type a slash\nto go into it and link general dot css.\nAnd now we're going to link our\nother two CSS files. So to do that,\nwe just need to copy and paste this,\nand then we're going\nto link header dot css.\nAnd for the third one, we're\ngoing to link video dot css.\nAnd if we save it,\nwe linked all of our code in three\nseparate files and we're back to where we\nwere. Next,\nlet's focus on our header\nstyles and create our header.\nWe're going to go into this file And we\nactually don't need this display block\nanymore. So we use this to put\nthe search bar on a separate line,\nbut now the search bar is\ninside a bunch of divs,\nso the divs will create that\nseparate line for us. Now,\nthe one other thing that we had to do is\nthat notice that there is some spacing\non the left side, on the right\nside and at the top. So by default,\nif we right click and inspect\nand we look at the body.\nSo the body element has eight pixels\nof margin on every side by default.\nNow to get a more precise design, we\nactually want to set this to zero.\nSo we're going to reset\nthese default styles.\nSo we'll go into our CSS code and\nwe're going to go into the general file\nand we're going to target the body and\nwe're going to get rid of all margins.\nAn easier way to do this is to set\nthe margin property and set it to\nzero. So this will set all margins in\nall directions to zero. Let's save it.\nAnd now our elements are right\nup to the edge of the page.\nNext we're going to work on our header.\nSo I'm actually going to make this\nwider so that we can have both of these\nfiles on each side.\nSo we're going to have the HTML on\nthe left and the CSS on the right.\nSo the first thing we'll do is we're\ngoing to add a height to this header so\nthat it looks like our design here.\nSo let's go into our header file. And\nremember we set a class of header,\nso we'll target that using dot header,\nand we'll set a height of maybe 40 pixels.\nOkay,\nso let's compare that to our design.\nLooks like our design is a lot taller.\nLet's change it to maybe 55 pixels.\nLet's compare that. So I'm just comparing\nthis to the bottom edge of here,\nand that looks pretty good.\nSo next we're going to position these\nthree sections, the left section,\nthe middle section, and the right section.\nSo in our code,\nwe can't actually see the sections right\nnow because they don't have any content\nin them.\nLet's just call this the left\nsection and then add the text here\nas well. The right section,\nsave it. And now we have\nthese three. However,\nyou'll notice that they're\nbeing aligned vertically,\nand that's because divs by\ndefault are display block,\nand we haven't made this\ninto a flex box yet.\nSo to create a horizontal layout,\nwe're going to turn our header\ncontainer here into a flex box.\nWe're going to set the display to flex,\nand we're also going to set\nthe flex dash direction to\nrow to lay them out\nhorizontally slots safe.\nAnd now our sections only take up as\nmuch space as we need to as we saw in our\nexamples. Next,\nlet's give these a background\ncolor so it's easier to see them.\nSo for the left section we're\ngoing to target it And we'll set a\nbackground dash color of light blue.\nAnd for the middle section\nwe'll set a background\ncolor of light pink.\nAnd for the right section, we're going\nto set a background color of light blue,\nright section,\nbackground color of light blue.\nSo now how do we create this layout?\nSo let's analyze it a little bit.\nIf we resize the page, notice that\nthis middle section is also resizing.\nSo to achieve this, we're going\nto use a property called flex.\nSo if you recall in our examples, flex\ntakes up the remaining amount of space.\nSo if I look at the header\nin our final project,\nwhen I resize this right\nsection is not changing,\nits width and neither is the left section.\nSo these will have a predefined width,\nand then this will be flex\nbecause as you can see,\nit's growing as the page is being resized.\nSo that's an example of how to\nanalyze these layouts. Don't worry,\nyou'll get better with\nmore practice. For now,\nwe're going to do this example\ntogether. On the left section,\nwe're going to set a fixed width.\nLet's set this to maybe 200 pixels.\nSee how that looks. We'll\ncompare it to our design.\nSo it's actually a little too much.\nI wanted to end right here\nafter the YouTube logo.\nSo we're going to go back and\nlet's change this to one 50 pixels.\nAnd let's compare it. So\nthat looks pretty close.\nFor this middle section,\nwe wanted to stretch.\nSo remember the property to\ndo that is called flex one.\nSo now the middle section is\nstretching. And for the right section,\nwe also want a fixed\nwidth. So let's compare it.\nWe want it to be somewhere here.\nLet's try setting a width of 200 pixels\nand then let's compare these two. Okay,\nso I think this is pretty close to\nthe structure that we have here.\nSo what we're doing is we're just\nsimplifying the structure into the bigger\npicture, and then we'll go in\nand add these smaller details.\nNow we're going to set some spacing\non the left and the right side of this\nmiddle section. So remember to do\nthat, we're going to set our margins.\nSo on the left side,\nlet's set a margin dash left of maybe\n30 pixels, save it. And let's compare.\nThere's definitely more than 30 pixels.\nLet's change it to maybe 70 pixels.\nSave it and compare. So\nthis compared to this,\nI think that's close enough.\nSo now for the right section,\nwe're also going to add a little bit\nof space. So if we look at our design,\nso it's less space than we have here.\nSo we're going to add a margin to\nthe right of the middle section,\nand we'll set it to\nmaybe 30 pixels, save it.\nAnd that looks pretty close to\nwhat we have here, maybe 35 pixels.\nOkay, so now if we resize our page,\nyou'll notice that the middle section\nis growing and shrinking with the page.\nAnd the right and left are\nstaying the same width,\nwhich is exactly what we have here.\nSo there's one other detail we're\ngoing to copy for this middle section.\nNotice that if I resize the\nbrowser and make it wider,\nat some point the middle section stops\ngrowing. So at roughly this point,\nthe middle section will stop growing.\nIf the browser gets wider and it just\nkeeps the same width and is centered\nhorizontally, we're going\nto learn how to do that.\nLet's go back into our project and we're\ngoing to limit the width of this middle\nsection first.\nSo we'll go into our code and\nthe property to do that is called\nmax dash with.\nAnd let's set it to 300 pixels.\nSo this property says the width\ncan be less than 300 pixels,\nbut as soon as it grows to be over 300\npixels, we're going to limit it to 300.\nSo that's what we see here. Now,\nwhen we resize the browser\nto be less than 300 pixels,\nnotice that it's shrinking and growing\nagain, but when the browser gets wider,\nit's limited to 300 pixels\nbecause of this line of code.\nNext,\nwe want to distribute these three sections\nevenly across our horizontal space.\nSo just like what we have here. Now\nremember to do that in flex box.\nWe have an example here.\nIf we go back into our code and go\ninto our flex box practice file,\nwe can find that example in our code.\nAnd remember that we achieved this\nusing a property called justify\ncontent space between,\nand we set this property\non our flex box container,\nand that's what we're going to\ndo for our project right now.\nSo we're going to go up\nto our flex box container.\nLet's go back to our YouTube hdml\nand to spread these out evenly\nacross the entire horizontal space.\nAnd we're going to set\njustify dash content space\ndash between. Let's save it.\nAnd now they take up the entire space.\nSo if we compare this to our design,\nwe'll notice that the middle section is\nstill a little bit too narrow compared\nto our design.\nSo let's increase the max width here.\nSo let's increase it to 400\npixels, see how that looks.\nOkay, so it's still bigger.\nLet's increase it to 500 pixels.\nSee how that looks. Okay, so I think\nthat looks close enough to our design.\nSo this middle section in pink is\nroughly equal to this middle section\nover here. So that's\nthe end of this lesson.\nWe learned about Flex Box and we used\nit to create the layout for our header.\nSo in this situation, we were\nmostly focused on our content size.\nWe wanted to make sure the middle\nsection had a max width and at least some\nspace in between.\nSo that's why we used a flex box because\nwe were focused on our content size\nfirst. And then the layout\ndoesn't matter as much.\nWe just use a flex box to spread out\nour content evenly across the horizontal\nspace. So when we focus on content\nsize first, we use a flex box.\nWhen we want to create a grid, we use\ngrid. And for most other situations,\nfor example, this horizontal layout\nthat we created in the layers technique,\nwe can use either grid or flexbox. In\nmost situations, they do the same thing.\nSo here are some exercises that you can\npractice using Flexbox to get yourself\nmore familiar with how it works.\nAnd now that we have the general layout,\nwe're going to finish up the rest\nof the header. Before we do that,\nwe're going to download all of these\nicons and images that you see here.\nTo do that, we're going\nto right click inspect,\nand then click this in the top left and\nthen click the icon we want to download.\nAnd then we can find the URL down here.\nI'm going to hover over it and then\nclick this link to open in a new tab\nand then save it with control S.\nSo I'm going to save this in the\nfolder that contains our code,\nwhich is this one. So\nI'm going to save it.\nAnd then in our code editor,\nwe should see this icon,\nso we can collapse this by pressing that.\nAnd then now we have our icon right\nhere called the hamburger menu.\nNow looking at our header, we\nhave a lot of icons to download.\nSo let's organize them using a folder.\nWe're going to create a new folder,\nand let's call this icons.\nAnd we're going to put the icon\nwe downloaded into that folder.\nSo this one right here into this folder.\nAnd now we're going to do the same steps\nto download all of these other icons\nand this image that we see here. So\nwe're going to do the same steps.\nClick the top left and then click the\nicon we want to download and we can find\nthe link here.\nI'm going to fast forward the video here\nbecause it's just a bunch of repetitive\nsteps, and we'll continue after\nwe downloaded all the icons.\nSo when you get to the notification icon,\ndon't worry about this\nnotification number here.\nWe're going to learn how to\ndo that in the next section.\nAnd for this channel profile\npicture, when I download it,\nI'm actually going to save it in a\ndifferent folder from the other icons.\nSo if I download this here and save it,\nI'm going to put this in the channel\npictures folder instead of the icons\nfolder, because technically\nit's a channel picture.\nSo once we have all of that downloaded,\nlet's check in our code editor and we\nshould see all of the icons that we need\nfor the header inside the icons folder,\nas well as the channel profile picture\non the right in the channel pictures\nfolder.\nAnd now we're ready to complete\nour header in our current project.\nSo in our left section we have this,\nwhich is a called a hamburger\nmenu and the YouTube logo.\nSo N our HTML. In this\nfile, in our left section,\nwe're going to have an image and\nwe're going to tell it what to\nload. So loading and SVG is the\nsame thing as any other image.\nAnd we're going to go into the icons\nfolder and we're going to load the\nhamburger menu dot svg.\nAnd then we're also going\nto load the YouTube logo,\nwhich is right here.\nSo YouTube logo dot svg,\nsave that and look at\nour webpage and refresh.\nSo the images are loaded, but they're\nway too big. Let's make them smaller.\nWe're going to set a class so\nthat we can target them with css.\nSo hamburger dash menu. And for this one,\nlet's set a class of YouTube dash logo.\nAnd now in our css,\nlet's go in here and target the hamburger\nmenu class.\nAnd let's set the height to\nsomething like 20 pixels.\nAnd same thing for the YouTube logo.\nWe'll set the height to 20 pixels.\nSo that looks pretty good.\nNow, if we look at our design,\nwe'll notice that these images are\nactually aligned vertically in the center.\nSo in our flex box practice\nfile, we learn how to do this.\nIf we look at our code, again,\nif we look at our flex box code,\nlet's scroll all the way\ndown to the last example.\nWe did this using a align items center,\nso that aligns them vertically\nin the center like this.\nWe'll go back to our header c s s\nand just have this as a reference.\nSo for our left section, we're\ngoing to set a line, dash items,\ncolon center. However, you'll\nnotice that it didn't do anything.\nAnd that's because if we look at\nour html. The header is a flex box,\nbut this left section\nhere is still a regular,\nit's a element inside the flex box,\nbut this itself is not a flex box.\nSo Align items doesn't do anything\nNow to fixes.\nWe can actually turn the left\nsection into a flex box using Display\nFlex, And if we save it now\nthe left section is a flex\nbox, so align items will align\nit vertically in the center.\nSo Flex Box doesn't\nactually go down two layers.\nIt only affects elements on the first\nlayer like this Diviv and this Diviv.\nIf we go down another level, like\nhere, flex box doesn't affect it.\nThat's why we have to turn this into\na flex box as well in order to use\nproperties like Align Items center.\nSo this situation of putting a flex\nbox inside another flex box is totally\nvalid. If we want to target another\nlevel of elements like this,\nlet's go into our design and compare it.\nAnd you can see that for our design\nthere is some spacing on the left and\nright of the hamburger menu.\nSo we can create that\nright now using margin\ndash left of 20 pixels\nand margin dash right\nof 20 pixels. So we'll add 20\npixels on both of these sides.\nSo if I go back and forth,\nyou'll notice that this icon is a\nlittle bit bigger than our project,\nso we can actually adjust our height here\nto make our icon a little bit bigger.\nWe can maybe set this\nto 24 and let's compare\nit. Okay, so that looks pretty close.\nSo now I notice that this icon is a\nlittle bit to the right of our website,\nwhich is here. So you notice that\nit's a little bit to the right,\nwe need to add more spacing.\nSo let's add margin left of\nmaybe 24 pixels. Save it.\nNow if we compare the two.\nSo that looks pretty much close to what\nwe need and the YouTube logo is also in\nthe same place, so that's a bonus for us.\nSo now it looks like the left section is\npretty much done in our project and we\ncan get rid of this background\ncolor that we were practicing with.\nFirst. We're actually\ngoing to remove the width.\nSo this width of 150 pixels is forcing\nthe left section to only end up here.\nHowever, if we remove this,\nthe left section will stretch to contain\nall of its content. So if we save it,\nyou can see that it stretches. Now\nwe can remove the background color\nand that's done. Next we're going\nto work on this middle section.\nSo for this middle section in\nour design, we have an icon here,\na button here. And if we resize,\nyou'll notice that the search box also\nresizes. So this search box is going to\ngrow with the rest of the page. So\nwe already learned how to do that.\nAs a reminder, it's flex one.\nSo first let's go in and create these\ntwo buttons first because that's the easy\npart.\nLet's go into our code in\nthe middle section here.\nAfter the search bar, we're\ngoing to create two buttons.\nSo let's create one button here\nand another button down here.\nSo inside this first button we're\ngoing to have this search icon.\nSo if we go into our icons folder,\nit's this icon here, search dot svg.\nSo we can create an image element,\nsource and icons slash search svg.\nIn the second button we're going\nto have our voice search icon,\nwhich is this one,\nand we're going to create another\nimage element and we're going to load\nicons slash voice search icon.\nNow let's save it and\nsee how that looks. Okay,\nso that didn't work out very well\nprobably because if you remember when we\nloaded this icon here, it was super big.\nSo the two icons we loaded are probably\nsuper big and we only see the top left\ncorner, which is empty.\nSo first let's make our icon smaller\nand make our buttons a little bigger.\nLet's go into our html.\nWe're going to add some classes so that\nwe can target it with css. It's class.\nLet's call this the search dash button.\nAnd let's call this one\nthe voice dash search dash\nbutton.\nSo we're going to go to\nthe middle section here.\nWe're going to target\nthe search button first.\nLet's set the height to something\nlike 40 pixels and set the\nwidth to something like 60 pixels.\nAnd for the voice search button,\nif we look at our design,\nit's pretty much round. So let's\ntarget voice search button.\nLet's set a height of 40\npixels and we'll set the width\nto 40 pixels as well.\nSo let's save it. Okay,\nso that looks super weird, but\nwe're going to fix this right now.\nSo remember that we want to align these\nin the center vertically just like this.\nTo do that, our middle section\nis also going to be a flex box,\nand then we can use the align items\nproperty that we use for the left\nsection.\nSo let's make this middle section\na flex box and we're going to set\ndisplay to flex and\nwe're going to set a line\ndash items\nto center just like our left section.\nSo now if we save,\nyou'll see that everything is aligned to\nthe center and now it's ready for us to\nstyle. So there is one thing that I\nleft out which is flex direction row.\nSo this tells a flex box to lay\nout our content horizontally.\nAnd this is actually the default\nvalue, so we don't actually need it.\nI put it here just for our\npractice code before our header.\nWe can be safe actually leaving that line\nout and just having display flex and a\nitem center. So now\nthat the layout is good,\nwe're going to go back to our tried and\ntrue method of styling this one by one\nwith css. The first thing I'm\ngoing to adjust is this search bar.\nSo notice that it stretches to fill up\nthe content when we resize the page.\nTo do that, we're going\nto go into our code,\nwe're going to target the search bar,\nsearch dash bar right here.\nAnd remember to\nstretch it to take up the remaining space.\nWe're going to set flex one and save.\nNow let's make the search\nbox similar to the design.\nSo I'm actually going to move this\nhere side by side so that it's easier\nto copy from.\nSo I'll go back into my code and the\nfirst thing I'll adjust is the height.\nSo let's set a height of 40 pixels.\nThat looks a little too much. Let's set\nthe height to 36. See how that looks.\nSo I think it's still a little\ntoo much. Let's set a 2 34.\nAnd that looks pretty good to me. Next,\nlet's adjust this placeholder text.\nSo to adjust the placeholder, we actually\nneed another sort of pseudo class.\nSo we're going to type dot search\nbar to target the search bar,\nand then we're going to type\ncolon, colon placeholder.\nSo this is how you target the placeholder\non an input element like this.\nSo first, let's set the font dash family\nto the one we're using for this\npage. If we go to general css,\nwe're using Reto aerial,\nso we're going to set\nthat to Roberto Aerial,\nsave it. So the font changed a little bit.\nWe're going to change the\nfont size to make it bigger.\nFont size 16 pixels. Let's see.\nOkay, I think that looks a little bigger.\nAnd the next we'll notice that on the\ninside of this input we have a little bit\nof space, while we don't\nhave that much space here.\nSo we're going to set some padding\non the left of our search bar.\nSo let's set the padding\ndash left to 12 pixels,\nsave it. Okay, that looks okay.\nLet's actually set it to 10 pixels.\nAnd then when we start\ntyping into the search bar,\nnotice that the font is bigger,\nbut for here we still have the small font.\nSo we can set the font size\nto 16 pixels, see how that looks. Okay,\nso that looks pretty\nclose to what we have.\nAnd next I'm going to change the border.\nSo I'll set the border\ndash width to one pixels,\nthe border style, we want it to be solid.\nAnd finally I'm going to set\na border dash color of gray.\nLet's see how that looks. Okay,\nso I can't really tell the\ncolor because of the background.\nWe're going to remove this light pink\nbackground because we don't need it\nanymore. And that looks a little too dark.\nSo I'm going to pick something\nlighter, maybe something like this\nsave. And I think that's\nclose enough to that. Next,\nlet's adjust the height again,\nbecause when we set the border,\nit actually made it a little bit smaller.\nSo we'll set the height to 36\nand now aligns with the buttons.\nAnd I'm also going to\ncreate rounded corners.\nSo that property is border dash radius.\nLet's set it to two pixels.\nNow the last style we're going\nto adjust for this is the shadow.\nSo if we zoom into this search box,\nthere's actually a little bit of shadow\nin the inside while our search box does\nnot have that. So we'll go back into our\ncode and we're going to add a shadow.\nSo we're going to use this from one\nof the very early lessons box dash\nshadow.\nAnd if we want a shadow on the inside\nof the element instead of the outside,\nwe just need to set\ninset at the beginning.\nSo this will put this\nbox shadow in the inside.\nNow we have our usual values,\nwhich is the horizontal position.\nSo let's set it to one pixels.\nSo it's going to be moved one pixels\nto the right and the vertical position,\nlet's set it to two pixels.\nThe shadow will be moved two pixels\nto the bottom. Let's set a blur of\nmaybe five pixels and we'll\nset the shadow color to R G\nB A 0 0 0, which is black.\nAnd then transparency set\nto only 0.15 to get a very\ntransparent black. So let's save this.\nSo that's way too much.\nLet's actually reduce the blur to\nthree pixels maybe and then change\nthis to 0.05. So we're doing a\nlot of trial and error with css,\nwhich is normal. So I think this\nlooks pretty close to our design.\nI think it looks close enough for now\nwe're going to move on and style the\nbuttons. So first,\nlet's resize this icon inside the button.\nSo let's give this a\nclass of search dash icon,\nsave it,\nand then in here in the dot search icon,\nwe're going to make it a little smaller.\nSo let's set the height to 20 pixels,\nsee how that looks. Okay, so that looks\ntoo small. I'm going to try 25 pixels.\nAll right, so that size\nlooks pretty similar.\nNow you'll notice that this one is\nvertically aligned while ours is not.\nSo we can either turn the search button\ninto a flex box or we can just do a\nsimpler solution.\nWe're going to add some spacing to\nthe top of this icon to push it down.\nSo margin dash top of maybe four pixels\nto push that down just a little bit.\nOkay, so I think that looks close enough.\nLet's finish off this button. We're\ngoing to set a background color\nof gray,\nand then I'm going to adjust it to match\nthat. So I'm going to pick something\nlike this, maybe two 40\nand then save it. That looks pretty\ngood, but now our borders are messed up.\nSo we're going to set the\nborder border with of one\npixel border dash style of\nsolid color and border\ncolor is going to be the\nsame as our text box. So we can\ngo up here and just copy that\nand right there, save it. And there we go.\nThat looks pretty close right now.\nSo now we want to move this button into\nthis input element a little bit like you\nsee here, so that we only have one\nedge to do that. Here's a little trick.\nWe can set some spacing on\nthe left, some margin left,\nexcept this time we're going\nto add negative spacing.\nSo we're going to add negative one\nspacing, normal margin adds space,\nand it pushes the element negative margin\nsubtracts space and pulls the element\nto that side. So margin left of a negative\nnumber, we'll pull it to the left.\nSo let's pull it to the\nleft by one pixel, save it,\nand that looks really good.\nNow we're going to make our\nbutton a little bit longer.\nLet's change it to 66. Finally,\nwe're going to style this\nvoice search icon first.\nWe notice that there's a little\nbit of space between these two.\nSo let's set a margin on the\nright side of the button.\nSo this time it's normal margin margin of\nmaybe eight pixels.\nI think that looks pretty close.\nI'm actually going to set it to 10.\nAnd then for this button, I'm\nfirst going to make it round.\nSo let's go into these styles of\nthis button. And to make it round,\nwe just have to make the\ncorners as round as possible.\nLet's set the border radius\nand I'm going to set it to 20 pixels.\nSo a trick here is that if you set\nthis to half the width of the height,\nit will make it round. So let's save\nthis. And now we have a round button,\nbut we have a weird border.\nLet's actually get rid of it\nbecause it's not in our design.\nSo border and none to\nget rid of the border.\nSo it's looking really close. Our icon\nis a little bit bigger than this one,\nso we're going to target it in here.\nClass equals voice dash, search dash icon,\nand then NR css. We'll\ntarget that. So voice dash,\nsearch dash icon. So for this,\nlet's set a height of maybe\n20 pixels. See how that looks.\nIt's a little bit small.\nLet's increase it to 24.\nI think that looks pretty good.\nAnd next we're going to\ntry to vertically align it.\nWe're going to add a little bit of\nmargin on the top to push it down.\nSo margin dash top and four pixels.\nOkay, that looks pretty good. The last\nthing is to change the background color.\nSo we're going to change the\nbackground color to let's\nsay gray. And then I'll\npick another color.\nSo this time let's pick maybe 2 45\nand then save. Oh, so I\naccidentally put it on the icon.\nWe actually want to put\nthis on the entire button.\nSo I'm going to cut and paste\nthis onto the button styles.\nLet's save. And I think\nthat looks pretty close.\nSo this color is a\nlittle bit off from this,\nbut I think it's okay if we\nlook at the bigger picture.\nSo now we've completed the middle\nsection and you can compare it here\nto here. So we're looking\nreally good so far.\nNext we're going to\nfinish the right section.\nSo I'm going to put them side by side\nagain so it's easier for us to copy.\nSo the right section has\nthree icons and an image.\nSo we're going to add\nthem to our HTML first.\nSo let's go into the right section here.\nAnd we're going to create an image\nand we're going to load this,\nwhich is the upload icon.\nSo icons slash upload\ndot svg, and then we'll\nadd another one. So image.\nAnd this one is going to be icons slash.\nThis one is called YouTube apps svg.\nAnd then the last one is the\nnotification icon, which is here.\nSo image element.\nAnd we're going to load\nicons slash notifications\nsvg.\nAnd finally we're going to create another\nimage and we're going to load this\nchannel profile picture. So source.\nAnd this one is located\nin a different folder.\nIt's in the channel pictures folder,\nand it's called my channel dot jpeg.\nSo let's save it refresh. And again,\nour SVGs are massive, so let's go\nahead and resize them in our css.\nSo first, let's add classes\nto all of these images.\nSo we're going to set this\none to upload dash icon,\nso upload dash icon. The next one\nis going to be YouTube apps icon.\nSo class equals YouTube\ndash apps dash icon.\nNext one we'll do notifications dash icon.\nSo class equals notifications dash icon.\nAnd lastly, we're going to name\nthis a little bit different.\nLet's give it a class and let's\ncall this one current dash\nuser dash picture so it's a little\nmore clear that this is different\nand we can target it with css.\nSo let's go down into the right section\nhere and we'll scroll up and we'll\nfirst resize the icons.\nLet's resize the upload icon.\nLet's set a height of 24\npixels and then we'll do the\nYouTube apps icon that's set a height of\n24 pixels. And then\nthe notifications icon,\nwhich is right here. Icon.\nLet's set a height of this 24 pixels again\nand the current user picture. So\nnotice it's a little bit taller.\nLet's target that current\ndash user dash picture,\nand we're going to set a height of 32\npixels to make it a little bit taller.\nLet's save it. And now we have\nthe icons we're going to use.\nAgain, we want to align these\nvertically in the center.\nRemember to do that we're going to\nscroll up to our middle section,\nwhich is all the way up here.\nWe first have to turn this\ncontainer into a flex box,\nand then we can use online item\ncenter. So inside our H C M L,\nwe have to turn this into a\nflex box. Let's scroll down\nto the right section styles here.\nWe're going to turn\nthis display colon flex,\nand then we're going to set\nalign dash items colon center\nto align them vertically.\nSo let's save it. Okay,\nnext we want to distribute them\nevenly across the horizontal space.\nAnd remember from our practice code,\nthat one's called justify\ndash content space\ndash between. Let's save it.\nAnd now these icons are space\nevenly across the space,\nso it looks like they're a little\nbit too far apart from each other.\nWe can adjust that by adjusting the width.\nSo let's decrease the width to bring\neverything closer together to match our\ndesign. And I actually think this,\nall the icons look good enough.\nThe only last thing we're going\nto change is this picture here.\nSo notice it's still a square. We want\nto make it a circle. So as a review,\nwe're going to use border\nradius to make it a circle.\nSo let's set it to border radius.\nAnd the trick we learned is half of\nthis will make it round. So 16 pixels,\nsave it. And now we have a round\nchannel profile picture. Lastly,\nwe're pretty much done with this so we\ncan get rid of the blue background color.\nSo we'll scroll up and get rid of this.\nNow I actually noticed that we have\nspacing to the right here in our design.\nSo that's one thing I missed.\nSo let's add that right now.\nSo we're going to add margin\nright to this section of\nmaybe 24 pixels. Save it.\nAnd I think that's a little\ntoo much. I can't really tell.\nLet's send it to 20 just to be safe.\nOkay, so I'm happy with how this looks.\nAll right, so that's basically\nthe content in our header.\nIf we look at it right now,\nit looks really professional.\nSo I know that while we were working\non it, it looked a little bit weird,\nit looked unfinished, but you\njust got to trust the process.\nAnd at the end we have a\nreally professional result\nthat looks like our design.\nNow there's going to be one\nlast case I'm going to show you,\nand this is a weird behavior of flex box.\nSo if I resize my browser\nand I make it smaller,\nnotice that these icons start\nto get closer to each other.\nSo this happens because\nflex Box is flexible.\nWhen we start not having enough space,\nit'll start shrinking the items inside.\nBut if we look at our final\nproject and we shrink the browser,\nnotice that this doesn't shrink and we\nsort of forced only the search bar to\nshrink. So let's go back into\nour project and into our code.\nAnd Flexbox has a special property to\nprevent certain items from shrinking.\nSo we're going to scroll down\nto the right section here.\nAnd to prevent the right\nsection from shrinking,\nwe're just going to set this\nproperty flex dash shrink\ncolon zero. So this means\nthat no matter what happens,\nwe're going to keep this width\nand we're not going to shrink.\nSo zero means don't shrink if we save it.\nAnd now you're going to\nsee that it doesn't shrink,\nbut now when we resize it,\nnotice that the search bar\ndoesn't actually shrink all\nthe way like our design.\nSo the way to achieve this is to go\ninto our HTML and then we're going to\ngo into our search bar,\nwhich is right here.\nSo normally search bars have a default\nwidth and we can't really see that\nbecause we set flex to one. So\nit's sort of growing with a page,\nbut as soon as it hits that default\nwidth, it's not going to go down anymore.\nSo to remove that default width,\nwe can just set width to zero,\nwe save it,\nand now you can see that the search\nbox will start shrinking as much as\npossible. So to recap,\nwe set flex shrink of zero to this\nright section so it doesn't shrink,\nand then we set a width of zero to\nthe search bar so that it does shrink.\nHere are some exercises to get yourself\nfamiliar with using Flexbox to create\nflexible layouts.\nNow we're going to learn the last major\nskill that we need to finish off our\nproject. We're going\nto learn CSS position.\nSo position helps us do things like keep\nthe header at top of the page while we\nscroll. It also helps us keep the\nsidebar at the top of the page.\nAnd lastly,\nwhenever we see an element on top of\nanother element that's using CSS position,\nfor example here, the video\ntime is on top of the thumbnail,\nthe notification number is on top of\nthe icon. And when I hover over this,\nwe have a tool tip on top of the page.\nSo CSS position adds another\ndimension to our page.\nSo just like the previous lessons,\nwe're going to create a new HTML file,\njust a practice position. I'm\ngoing to go into my code editor,\nwe're going to create a new file and\nlet's put it right here beside the other\nones new file. Let's call this position\nhtml. Now as always,\nwe're going to start\nwith the HTML structure.\nSo we're going to have doc\ntype at the top and then an\nHTML element inside we have a head element\nand then we have a body element.\nNow we can right click and\nopen with live server and we're\nready to begin. So first,\nlet's add a title so that we\nknow what this HTML file is\nfor. Let's call this position practice.\nSay save it, and then\nit should show up here.\nWe're going to start in the body again,\nand we're going to create two divs.\nIt's called this diviv one\nand another diviv Diviv two.\nAnd I'm just going to resize this a\nlittle bit so we can see it side by side.\nSo just like before,\nwe're going to use inline styles so\nthat our CSS is close to our HTML code.\nI'm going to set a style\nand then we're going to set this\none to background dash color and\nlight blue.\nAnd we're going to set the height and\nthe width to 200 pixels. So height,\n200 pixels and with 200 pixels.\nNext we're going to set the\nsecond diviv to be the same size,\nbut with background color light\npink. So again, we set a style\nand then we set a background\ndash color of light pink\nheight of 200 pixels and width of 200\npixels.\nSo CSS position is just\nthe position property.\nSo let's go into our first diviv and\nwe're going to set the position property\nto static And then save.\nSo position static is\nthe default position.\nIt's the same thing as if you\ndon't have this line at all.\nNow we're going to learn a second position\nproperty that allows us to stick an\nelement to the top of the page\nlike this while we scroll.\nAnd that is called position fixed.\nSo we're going to create a new element\nat the top here and let's call this our\nheader. So we're going to learn how to\ncreate something that works like this.\nSo for this diviv, we're\ngoing to set a style\nof background color,\nblack and a text color of white.\nAnd now we're going to learn how to\nstick this to the top of the page.\nSo first of all, we need\nto be able to scroll,\nand right now I don't have enough\ncontent to make the page scroll.\nSo what I'll do is we'll go to the body\nhere and we're going to set a style.\nAnd then inside the body we're going\nto set a style of height and something\nreally big, like 3000 pixels.\nSo we just need to make sure that\nwe're able to scroll this page. Next,\nwe're going to make this header\nstick at the top. To do that,\nwe're going to use the position property,\nand this time we're going\nto set a position of fixed.\nNow when I save it and I start scrolling,\nnotice how the header element is\nsticking to the page when I scroll.\nSo that's how we make it stick.\nSo the first thing to note is that\nwhen we set position fixed like this,\nit doesn't take us space on the\npage anymore. So before we add this,\nand if I save it,\nso notice that it takes up the top of\nthe page and then these two divs up here\nbelow this header. But\nwhen we add position fixed,\nit no longer takes up that space at the\ntop of the page because it's sort of\nfloating above the page now. So\nthat's one way to think about it.\nSo the position property has four special\nproperties we can use to move this\nelement around. The\nfirst one is called top.\nThe way that top works is that we can\nset a pixel measurement. For example,\nif we set zero pixels,\nthis is going to make the top of our\nelement zero pixels from the top of our\nbrowser window here. So if I save it,\nnotice that the top of our element is\nright on the top edge of the browser\nwindow. If I set top to 10 pixels,\nthe top of our element is now 10 pixels\nfrom the top of the browser window.\nSo top specifies how far away our\nelement is from the top of the window,\nthe next property we can set is left.\nSo if we set left to zero pixels,\nthen the left side of our element will\nbe on the left edge of our window.\nIf we set left to 50 pixels, for example,\nnow the left side of our element will be\n50 pixels from the left of our window.\nSo left tells us how much space is between\nthe element and the left edge of the.\nSo we can set this in all four\ndirections we've seen top left.\nWe can also set bottom.\nAnd right now a special feature\nof these properties is that if\nwe set it in opposite directions, the\nelement will stretch. So for example,\nif we set it to left,\nand so these two are opposite directions\nand we set the right to 50 pixels,\nnotice that the element stretches.\nSo now this element is 50 pixels\nfrom the left of the page right here,\nand it is also 50 pixels\nfrom the right of the page.\nSo it will stretch the element\nto meet these two conditions.\nSame thing with top and bottom.\nSo if I set bottom to\n100 pixels and save it,\nthe element will stretch so that it is\n10 pixels from the top and it is 100\npixels from the bottom.\nSo this is how we move this element\naround and resize it with position fixed.\nNow let's try creating the\nheader that we see here.\nSo as you can see for this header,\nit's at the top edge of the page.\nIt's also on the left edge\nand on the right edge.\nSo that means that it's zero\npixels from the top as a shorthand,\nwe can just write zero.\nIt's zero pixels from the left and\nit's zero pixels from the right.\nNow for the bottom we might first try\nto calculate how far the bottom of this\nelement is from the bottom of the page.\nNow that's not going to\nwork if we resize the page,\nso we need a different approach. So first,\nlet's save this file and\ngo into our practice file.\nSo now you can see that this\nelement is sticking to the top,\nthe left and the right, which\nis what we have in our code.\nNow we have to figure out the height\nof this diviv. So in this case,\ninstead of using bottom, because\nremember the bottom can resize,\nwe want to use simply height.\nSo in addition to these properties,\nwe can simply use height and\nwidth to also resize this element.\nIt all depends on what\nsituation you're in.\nIf you want this fixed element\nto resize with the page,\nthen you would use top\nleft, right, and bottom.\nIf you just wanted to have a specific\nheight or width and you don't want it to\nresize, then you use height and width.\nSo here we're going to set the height\nto 50 pixels and we don't want it\nto resize with the page. So\nthat's exactly what we have here.\nNow when we start scrolling,\nyou'll notice that our header\nsticks to the top of the page.\nSo that's how we create something like\nthe YouTube header that we see here.\nNow, one last problem is that\nif we go to our practice file,\nnotice that if we scroll right to the top,\nthe header is covering our first diviv.\nSo we need to add some spacing at the\ntop to push our content\ndown below the header.\nTo do that, we go into our code,\nand the first thing you might think\nto do is to add margin to the top.\nSo we're going to add spacing to the top,\nand let's add a little more\nthan 50 pixels, so 60 pixels.\nSo if we save it and make sure you scroll\nup all the way to the top of the page,\nyou'll notice that we have 60\npixels of space at the top,\nand now our content is\nnot covered by the header.\nNow this is not the best solution\nbecause if our content order changes,\nfor example, if I move\nthis diviv down here,\nnotice that it doesn't work anymore.\nSo what we want instead is to always\nhave space at the top of our page\nregardless of what the content is.\nSo if I move this to the top here\nand remove margin top, I'm going to\nshow you the proper way to do this.\nSo to properly handle this situation,\nwe need to add spacing to the body\nelement. So let's scroll up to the body.\nSo we have two choices for adding\nspace to the top of our page.\nWe can either use margin\nor we can use padding.\nGenerally the best practice is to use\npadding at the top. So we're just going to\nadd spacing on the inside\nof our webpage at the top of\n60 pixels, save it and\nscroll all the way up.\nAnd now we have plenty of space at the\ntop of the page and our header is not\ncovering our contents.\nSo now that we learn position fix and how\nto move this element around and resize\nit,\nwe're going to go into the project we\nwere currently working on and we're going\nto put our header and stick\nit to the top of the page.\nSo let's learn how to do that first,\nI'm going to resize my windows a\nlittle bit so it's easier to work with.\nI'm going to put it right here.\nAnd then we're going to open the YouTube\ndot html file, which is our project.\nSo remember we put our\nCSS into separate files.\nSo I'm going to open\nthe header dot CSS file,\nand I'll put it on the side so\nyou guys can see it side by side.\nSo just like we learned, we're\ngoing to go into the header here.\nWe're going to set a\nstyle of position fixed,\nand remember to move this, we're going\nto use top, left, bottom, and right.\nSo top we want our header to\nstick to the top of the page.\nWe're going to set that to zero.\nWe want our header zero pixels from\nthe left, so on the left edge of the\npage and also zero pixels from the right.\nAnd finally, we're going to set a\nheight. So we already have it up here,\nso let's save it and see how it looks.\nSo the first thing we noticed is\nthat we lost our background color.\nNow the only reason we had a background\ncolor was because if we didn't have\nposition fixed,\nthis header takes space on the page\nand the page happens to be white.\nSo the header appears to be white, but\nnow that it's floating above the page,\nwe'll notice that it's\nactually transparent. So to\nadd our background color,\nagain, we just need to set\nthe background color property.\nSo let's set this to white, save it,\nand now we're back to where we were.\nNow if we go to our project\nand we start scrolling,\nyou'll notice that our header\nsticks to the top while we scroll.\nSo that's exactly what we want. Next we\nhave this problem where the header is\ncovering our content. So remember,\nthe way to fix this is to add\npadding to the top of our body.\nWe're going to go into our code and\nwe're going to go into this file\ngeneral css. That's where\nwe have styles for the body.\nAnd then we're going to set\na padding dash top of maybe\n60 pixels. Let's take a look.\nOkay, so that looks pretty good.\nLet's compare to our design.\nIf I scroll to the top here and\njust compare it a little bit,\nI noticed that our videos are appearing\nat a higher position than our design,\nso we're going to push\nthem down a little more.\nLet's set this to maybe 80 pixels.\nSave it so we push them down even more.\nAnd I think that looks\nclose enough to our design.\nSo the last thing I noticed is that\nwe're missing the border at the bottom of\nour header here. So let's\ngo ahead and add that.\nSo let's go back into our header css.\nWe're going to add a border to the bottom\nso we can actually add borders to one\nside at a time. We don't have to add\nborders to all four sides. To do that,\nwe're going to set these same\nborder properties we had before.\nSo we're going to start with border width,\nbut in the middle we're going to tell it\na direction. So we can tell it bottom.\nWe're going to also tell it top left.\nSo we have all these four directions.\nIn this case, we want\na border at the bottom,\nand we're going to set it to one pixels.\nAnd the other border\nproperties are the same.\nSo border style is going to be solid,\nbut we only want it at the bottom,\nso it's going to be border bottom style.\nAnd then lastly, border dash,\nbottom dash color. And\nlet's set it to gray.\nAnd I'm going to pick a\nlighter shade of gray.\nSo maybe right there, save it.\nLet's compare it to our design.\nIt looks like it's a little\ndarker than what we have.\nI'm just going to adjust the\ncolor to match our design.\nAnd it's not going to be\nperfect, but remember,\nyou can always inspect the design\nand then make it perfect. Okay,\nso now if I compare it, I think\nthat looks pretty close enough.\nAnd now if I scroll, you notice that\nthe header is sticking to the top,\nwhich is exactly what we want. Next,\nwe're going to how to create this sidebar.\nSo the sidebar is just like the\nheader, it sticks while we scroll.\nSo this is another\nexample of position fixed.\nWe're going to go back to our practice\nfile, and I'll resize my pages here\nand I'm going to open position\ndot html we were practicing with.\nAnd this time below the header,\nwe're going to create our sidebar.\nSo let's create a diviv, and this\ndiviv is going to be our sidebar.\nNow for the sidebar, let's set a style.\nAnd then inside we're going to set a\nbackground color of green this time.\nSo a background dash, color green,\nand a text color of white so that it's\neasier to distinguish between all of\nthese different elements. Next,\nwe're going to stick the\nsidebar to our browser.\nSo remember to do that we're\ngoing to use position fixed.\nSo position fixed and save it.\nAnd now when we scroll,\nyou'll notice that the sidebar is\nsticking to our browser while we scroll.\nLastly, we're going to put the sidebar\nin the right place using top left,\nright height or width. So let's\nlook at our sidebar. In our design,\nwe notice that the sidebar is sticking\nto the bottom, so we want bottom zero.\nIt's sticking to the left,\nso we want left zero.\nAnd for the top it's actually not\nreaching to the top of the page,\notherwise it would cover up the header.\nSo there's quite a difference between\nthe sidebar here and the top of the page.\nSo let's go back into our practice\nfile and learn how to position that.\nLet's start with left.\nWe want the sidebar to stick\nto the left side of the page.\nSo we're going to say zero\npixels from the left, save it.\nNow we want our sidebar to\nstick to the bottom of the page.\nSo we're going to say bottom\nand zero pixels from the bottom.\nAnd finally, we want it to be at the top\nof the page, but not cover the header.\nSo let's set the top to 50 pixels.\nSo it's going to meet right\nwhere the header ends.\nWe're going to set this to\n50 pixels and then save.\nAnd finally, we want to set the width\nof the sidebar. So for the sidebar,\nwe don't want it to resize with the page,\nso that's why we're going to use the\nwidth property instead of something like,\nright.\nSo let's go back into our practice file\nand we're going to set the width to\nmaybe 72 pixels, save it.\nAnd that looks like what we have\nin our design, so that's perfect.\nNow we have the same problem again\nwhere our fixed element is covering our\ncontent. So let's scroll back to the top.\nWe're going to add padding to our body\nso that these elements are not covered by\nthe sidebar. So in this case, we\nwant extra space on the left side.\nSo I'm going to set padding dash left,\nand let's set it to 80 pixels,\nwhich is more than the\nsidebars with 72 pixels.\nSo now if we save this,\nwe have 80 pixels of padding\non the left side of the page,\nand now the sidebar is\nnot covering our content.\nSo that's how we position a sidebar.\nNow we're going to create the\nsidebar in our project here.\nSo let's go back into YouTube dot html,\ngoing to resize my page so\nthat we can see it better.\nAnd we're going to create\na sidebar on the left.\nSo let's go into our code and we're\ngoing to put the sidebar right below our\nheader. So let's scroll\ndown below our header here,\nand I'm going to create a diviv.\nThis is going to be our sidebar,\nand I'm going to give a class of sidebar\nso that we can target it in\nour css. Now for these styles,\nlet's actually put them in a separate\nCSS file. So if we scroll up to the top,\nwe have CSS files for our\nheader for our videos,\nso it makes sense to split up our sidebar\nstyles into their own file so that we\norganize our code better.\nWe're going to go into our code editor\nand then go into the styles folder here.\nAnd we're going to create a new file\nand we're going to call it sidebar\ncss. And I'm going to put\nit on the side like this.\nNext we're going to load\nsidebar CSS into our html.\nSo we just have to do one of these\nagain, I'm just going to copy them.\nAnd then instead of video css,\nwe're going to load sidebar css.\nAnd now we're ready to style this\nsidebar that we just created.\nSo let's target the sidebar class\nand we're going to set position\nto fixed to make it stick.\nNow for the sidebar, we want it to be\nzero pixels from the left of our browser.\nSo let's set left to zero.\nAnd we also want it to stick to the\nbottom of our browser, so bottom to zero.\nAnd finally, we want it\nto stretch to the top,\nbut we don't want it to cover our header.\nSo let's set the top to whatever\nthe height of our header is.\nSo if we go to header\ndot css, which is here,\nwe can check the height of\nour header is 55 pixels.\nSo we're going to go into our sidebar\nhere and we're going to get the sidebar to\nend 50 pixels or 55 pixels from the top.\nSo let's set that to 55 pixels, save it.\nSo with position fix,\nthe element is no longer on the page\nanymore and it doesn't have a background\ncolor, so we just have to set\nthat. Again, background dash color.\nI'm going to set it to white, save it.\nAnd now we have our sidebar.\nThe final thing is to make our\nsidebar as wide as our design,\nwhich is right here.\nSo we're going to set\nthe width to 72 pixels,\nsave it, and let's\ncompare it to our design.\nAnd I think it's hard to see because it's\nwhite here and it's a little bit gray\nhere, but I think that's close enough.\nNow the next problem we have is that\nthe sidebar is covering our content.\nSo as we learn,\nwe're going to add some padding to\nthe left to push our content over.\nSo let's go into our general\nstyles. So general css,\nand we're going to style the body.\nWe're going to add padding\nto the left of our body,\nand let's add padding of 80 pixels again.\nAnd now our sidebar is no longer covering\nour content because we added a bunch\nof padding to the left of our page.\nSo that's how we use position fixed to\ncreate elements that stick to the page\nwhile we scroll, like our\nheader and our sidebar\nfor now,\nhere's some exercises that you can do on\nyour own to get a better understanding\nof CSS position.\nNow we're going to learn another\nposition property that we can use.\nLet's go into our position, practice\nfile. And the same in our code editor.\nWe're going to open up position, HTML\nand then close all of these files.\nSo I'm going to resize it so\nthat we can see it better.\nSo this time we're going\nto learn position absolute.\nLet's do an example to see how it works.\nSo let's scroll down and we're going\nto create a diviv below our sidebar to\npractice position. Absolute.\nLet's create a diviv and then\nlet's call this absolute.\nAnd now we're going to set some\nstyles on the diviv. So style equals,\nand then inside here we're going\nto set position with a value of\nabsolute.\nAnd we're also going to set a background\ncolor of red so that it's easier to\nsee. So background color of red, and\nthen the text color is going to be white.\nSo color of white, save it.\nAnd now we have our position, absolute\nelement. So before we continue,\nmake sure we scroll all the\nway up to the top of our page.\nNow, position absolute also takes\nthe same values as position fixed.\nSo top, left, bottom and right\nas well as width and height,\nbut they behave a little bit differently.\nSo first we're going to set left.\nSo let's set the left property\nto zero and let's save it.\nAnd now the left side of our element is\nzero pixels from the left side of our\npage. So this works the\nsame way as position fixed,\nand we set left to 10 pixels.\nNow there will be 10 pixels between our\nelement and the left side of our page.\nNow let's try setting top. So I'm\ngoing to set the top to 10 pixels,\nsave it and make sure you\nscroll all the way up.\nSo you'll notice that our element is\nnow 10 pixels from the top of the page.\nSo mostly these properties work\nthe same as position fixed,\nbut with one key difference.\nFor position fixed,\nthe elements are placed in the browser\nwindow while for position absolute the\nelements are placed on the page.\nNow what I mean by this is that\nwhen we scroll the browser window or\njust this visible part is not moving,\nonly the page is moving up and down.\nSo for position fixed, we're going to\nput these elements on the browser window,\nwhich doesn't move when we scroll.\nSo if we scroll up to the header,\nif I say top and 10\npixels, this puts a header,\n10 pixels from the top of the browser\nwindow, not from the top of the page,\nwhich is constantly moving up and\ndown. But for position absolute,\nif we scroll down to there,\nwe're putting it 10 pixels\nfrom the top of the page,\nwhich scrolls up and down when we move.\nSo that's a key difference between\nthe two position fixed positions,\nthe element in the browser,\nwhich doesn't move when we scroll\nand position absolute positions,\nthe element on the page which\ndoes move when we scroll.\nSo let's go back up and\nreset this to zero so that we\nhave our proper header again and do some\nmore practice with position absolute.\nSo for example,\nif I wanted to put this absolute element\nin the top right corner here on our\npage, we can do something like right,\nand we'll put it 10 pixels\nfrom the right and then top.\nWe can put it maybe 60 pixels\nfrom the top, it was 60,\nsave it, and we scroll all the way up,\nand that's how we place an element on a\nprecise location on our page like this.\nAnd because it's on our\npage when we scroll,\nthe page will move up and this absolute\nelement will move up with the page.\nNow, one thing that's weird is that this\nelement is appearing above our header,\nand that's because this element was\nwritten in our code below our header.\nSo generally,\nan element that is written below is\ngoing to appear in front of elements that\nare written above it. Now,\nwe can actually override this if we\nscroll up by adding another property\ncalled Z dash index.\nSo Z index determines which elements\nappear in front and which elements appear\nbehind. So the default Z index is zero.\nThis is the same thing as if\nyou didn't have this at all,\nbut an element with a higher Z index\nwill appear in front of elements with a\nlower Z index.\nSo if we set the Z index\nof the header to one,\nit's going to have a higher Z index\nthan the absolute element which has a\ndefault Z index of zero. If we save it,\nnow the header will appear\nin front. Just as an example,\nif we scroll down and\nwe set the Z dash index\nof this absolute element\nand we set it to two,\nnow it's going to appear in front again\nbecause our Z index here is greater than\nour Z index here.\nSo usually we set this to something\nlike 100 so that we can have a lot of\nelements in between. If our\npage has a lot of layers,\nand usually if we don't\ncare about the Z index,\nwe can just remove it and\nhave a default of zero.\nNow that we learn position\nabsolute, where do we use this?\nThe truth is we don't use\nit like this very much.\nThis is not a common situation that we\nrun into when we're creating websites.\nHowever, position absolute has another\nkey feature that makes it really,\nreally useful to demonstrate.\nWe're going to take this element and\nwe're going to make a copy of it and we're\ngoing to put it inside the sidebar.\nSo right here.\nSo we're going to put a position\nabsolute inside a position fixed.\nSo now when we save,\nyou'll notice that this element is\nnot being placed on the page anymore.\nWhat it's actually doing is placing this\nelement relative to this position fixed\nelement. So now right of 10\npixels is actually 10 pixels.\nFrom the right of the fixed element,\nwhich is the sidebar top of 60\npixels is 60 pixels from the top\nof the sidebar, not from\nthe top of the page.\nSo whenever a position absolute is\ninside a position fixed element,\nit's going to be placed a relative\nto this position fixed element.\nSo this is the most important\nfeature of position absolute.\nSo let me show you why it's so useful.\nLet's say that we wanted a close\nbutton on the top right of our sidebar.\nWe want to be able to close\nour sidebar if we want to.\nI'm going to change this to an X so\nthat it's kind of like a close button.\nAnd then to put it in the\ntop right of our sidebar,\nwe just have to set the top\nto zero and the right to zero.\nSo if I save that, now this\nelement is in the top right,\nand that's because if position\nabsolute is inside position fixed,\ntop zero means zero pixels from the\ntop of the position, fixed element,\nright? Zero means zero pixels from the\nright of the position fixed element.\nSo this is how we attach elements\nto the corners or the sides of other\nelements. If we look at our final project,\nwe can see that going\non in our videos here.\nWe have the video time in the corner\nof our thumbnail here we have the\nnotification count in the top\nright corner of this icon.\nAnd using position absolute,\nit allows us to put elements\nin the corner like this.\nSo there's one last thing\nwe need to learn here.\nWe have a position absolute\ninside a position, fixed element.\nThat's why we can put it in the corner.\nBut notice that this is still a position\nfixed element and it sticks to the\npage. But in our final project, these\nvideos are not sticking to the page,\nthey're scrolling with the page,\nand we're still able to put stuff in\nthe corners. So how do we achieve this?\nAnd to do this,\nwe're going to learn another value for\nthe position property called position\nrelative. We're going to scroll\ndown to our two divs at the bottom.\nAnd for our second diviv,\nwe're going to set the\nposition to relative\nand save it. Now, if\nwe go back to our page,\nwe'll notice that\nnothing actually changed.\nAnd that's how position relative works.\nIt's still displays the element as normal,\nexcept if we put position\nabsolute in here,\nit will position it relative to this\nelement instead of relative to the page.\nSo let's go through an example to\nsee what I mean. If I scroll up here,\nlet's copy this absolute element.\nLet's copy it and then paste\nit inside this position,\nrelative element, save it,\nand then reformatted a bit,\npress tab. And if we save this,\nyou'll notice that we get the same\neffect as when we put position absolute\nimposition.\nFixed right of 10 pixels now means 10\npixels from the right of the position,\nrelative element, not 10 pixels.\nFrom the right of the page,\ntop of 60 pixels means 60 pixels\nfrom the top of the position,\nrelative element, not 60 pixels\nfrom the top of the page.\nSo two things are happening here.\nWhen position absolute is\ninside position relative,\nthis will be positioned on\nthe element, not on the page.\nSo that's what we just talked about.\nThe second thing that happens here is\nthat position relative causes this whole\nelement to display normally. So that's\nwhat we get in our final project.\nNotice that these videos are displayed.\nNormally they scroll with the page,\nbut we have something in\nthe bottom right corner.\nSo these are all positioned relative.\nAnd then to put something\nin the bottom right corner,\nwe're going to put a\nposition absolute inside.\nSo let's actually go through an\nexample here. So we have our position,\nrelative element. We have\nposition absolute inside.\nI'm going to put this in the bottom\nright corner, just like our design.\nSo let's change this to five minutes\nand pretend this is our final project.\nLet's change the\nbackground color to black.\nAnd now we're going to put this\non the bottom right corner.\nSo let's get rid of this first.\nAnd we're going to put this 10\npixels from the bottom of the\nposition, relative element. So\nwe're going to say bottom 10 pixels.\nAnd we're also going to put it 10\npixels from the right of this position,\nrelative element. So right of 10 pixels.\nAnd that's how we position\nthis in the corner.\nAnd because this is positioned\nrelative, if we scroll the page,\nit acts like normal content.\nSo now that we learned\nthe technique of position,\nabsolute inside position relative,\nwe're going to apply that to our project\nand create the video time as well as\nthe notification number here.\nSo let's go back to our project\nand we're going to add video times\nfirst. So let's go to YouTube dot html.\nAnd we're also going to open the\nvideo CSS file. I'm going to put it\ndown here because we're working\nwith styles for the videos.\nSo first we're going to find our\nthumbnail, which is right here.\nAnd now remember to put\nsomething in the corner.\nWe're going to need position absolute\ninside a position relative element.\nSo if we look at our code, what could\nbe our position, relative element?\nWell, it can't really be the image element\nbecause image elements aren't really\ncontainers. We can't\nput something inside it.\nSo what we could use is\nthis thumbnail, row element.\nThis could be our relative element.\nAnd then the video time will be the\nabsolute element inside of here.\nSo first, let's create our video\ntime. We're going to create a diviv,\nand let's give it a\nclass of video dash time.\nAnd then inside we're\ngoing to put a video time.\nSo let's go to our final project and\nwe're going to copy one of these. So 14,\n20. Then inside I'm going to put 1420.\nLet's save it and go back. So\nright now is just a normal diviv.\nLet's go to our CSS file. And\nwe're going to style this.\nLet's scroll all the way down,\nand we're going to target\nvideo dash time class.\nAnd let's set the background dash\ncolor to black and the text color\nto white. So just like our final project.\nSo now we're ready to position it\nproperly. We're going to need position,\nabsolute inside position\nrelative. So first,\nlet's set the position relative on here.\nWe're going to scroll up to\nthumbnail row, which is right here.\nWe're going to set position relative.\nAnd remember, position relative\ndoesn't really change anything.\nEverything appears normal.\nThat's one of the benefits of it.\nAnd if we scroll down, we're\ngoing to change this to position\nabsolute and now top, bottom, left,\nand will be placed inside our\nposition relative element.\nSo if we save it, and now if we want\nto put it in the bottom right corner,\nwe just have to say bottom\nzero pixels from the bottom,\nand also zero pixels from the right.\nSo let's set the position from the\nbottom to maybe 10 pixels. Save it,\nand let's set the position from the\nright side to maybe five pixels. Save it.\nOkay, let's change this\nto maybe eight pixels.\nSo I think that looks pretty good,\nand if we compare it to our final\ndesign, it's in the right position.\nSo that's how we put an element\nin the corner of another element.\nWe need a position absolute\ninside a position relative.\nSo finally, let's style this one\nby one until it matches our design.\nI'm actually going to move this to\nthe bottom here so that it's easier to\ncompare.\nThe first thing we're going\nto do is to change the font.\nSo we're going to set font dash family to\nreto aerial,\nlike the rest of our fonts.\nAnd next, let's change the font size.\nLet's change it to font dash\nsize of maybe 12 pixels.\nThat looks pretty good. Let's\nmake it a little bit bolder.\nLet's change the font dash weight to 500.\nAnd remember a font\nweight of 400 is normal,\n700 is bold and 500 is\nsemi bold. Let's save that.\nThat looks pretty good. And next we need\nspacing on the inside of this element.\nSo that's padding.\nSo let's add some padding on the left of\nmaybe two pixels.\nAnd same for padding on the right\ntwo pixels and then padding on\nthe top of four pixels,\nand then padding on the\nbottom of four pixels. Save.\nThat looks pretty good. Let's add some\nmore padding on the left and right.\nChanges to four pixels\nand four pixels. Okay,\nso I'm pretty happy with that. Next,\nwe're going to make our corner\nrounded kind of like this.\nSo to do that we're going to\nuse border radius, chain Z,\nborder dash radius to two pixels, save it.\nAnd I think that looks pretty close\nto our design. And there we go.\nWe created the video time in the\nbottom right corner of the thumbnail.\nNow to give you guys a bit more practice,\nI'm going to get you to add the video\ntime to all of our other videos.\nSo inside our html,\nyou're going to add this video time\nto the next video here and all the\nvideos in the H T M L.\nSo take some time to complete that\nand then we'll continue the lesson.\nSo now that we have the video\ntime for all of our videos,\nwe're going to run into another problem.\nIf we start scrolling up on this page,\nyou'll notice that the thumbnails\nappear above our header.\nBut another thing is that\nthe other content like this\ntext and the channel image\nwill appear below our header.\nSo what exactly is going on?\nSo we mentioned this briefly in the\npractice file. If an element like this\nvideo preview is written below\nanother element like the header up\nhere, the element that is written\nbelow will appear in front.\nThat's what's happening\nhere. We have a header,\nand then below that we have the thumbnail,\nwhich is going to appear on\ntop of the header. However,\nwhat I didn't mention is that this rule\ndoesn't apply to position static or\nthese elements with the\ndefault position. Position,\nstatic will always appear at the back.\nSo that's why you see that these always\nappear at the back as soon as we set it\nto something that's not position\nstatic like position relative.\nThe rules of which element was\nwritten first start to apply.\nSo in this case, because if we scroll up,\nthe thumbnail row is positioned relative\nand it's written below the header in\nthe code. It's going to\nappear on top of the header,\nwhich is what we see and\nremember, to fix this,\nwe need to set a property of Z index.\nLet's go into our header c s s\nfile. We're going to open this file here.\nAnd then inside the header,\nwe need to set a Z dash index to make the\nheader appear above the thumbnails.\nSo let's set a Z index of 100 so that\nwe have room if we want to put stuff\nbetween these two. Now, if I save it,\nthe header has a Z index of 100.\nThe thumbnail row has a default Z index\nof zero. 100 is greater than zero.\nThat means the header will appear\non top of all the thumbnails.\nSo if we go back and we start scrolling,\nyou'll notice that we're now all good.\nThe last thing we'll learn is how to\ncreate this notification count in the top\nright corner of this icon.\nSo let's go into our html,\nso YouTube dot html and find where\nthe code for this notification is.\nSo if we scroll down to the header and\nthen scroll down to the right side,\nthat's this code here, notification icons.\nSo I'm going to resize my windows\nso we can see it properly here.\nAnd now we want to put a notification\nnumber in the top right corner.\nSo remember, like we've been doing,\nwe need a position absolute\ninside a position relative.\nSo if we look at our html, what could\nwe use as our position relative element?\nSo it can't really be this image because\nwe can't put stuff inside an image\nelement. So one option\nis this diviv up here,\nbut a better option is actually\nto wrap this image element\ninside a diviv. So we're\ngoing to create a div here,\nand we're going to put this\nimage inside this diviv.\nSo remember that the diviv just\ncreates a box around whatever's inside.\nSo it's not going to change the\nappearance of this image. However,\nby creating this diviv, we can\nnow make this position relative,\nand that's going to help us add\nstuff to the top right corner.\nSo let's give this diviv a class\nso that we can style it later.\nLet's call it notifications. Dash,\nicon dash container.\nAnd inside we're going to\nhave our notification count.\nLet's create a diviv for our notification\ncount. Let's give it a count of three.\nAlexa at this class equals\nnotifications with an\nS dash count.\nAnd now we're ready to style\nthis and put it in the corner.\nSo let's go into header dot css.\nI'm going to put it on the side\nso we can see it more clearly.\nAnd now to start off,\nlet's scroll down to where we\nhave our notification code.\nSo let's scroll all the way down\nand we'll find it right here.\nAnd now remember, we're going\nto have position relative,\nand then inside we're going\nto have position absolute.\nSo let's style the dot notifications\ndash icon dash container\nand set this to position relative.\nAnd then the notifications\ncount, dashed count,\nand we'll set to position absolute.\nSo we want to put this\nin the top right corner.\nSo let's set the top to\nzero pixels and the right\nto zero pixels and to see it better.\nLet's set a background color.\nSo background dash color of red,\nand a text color of white.\nAnd now if we save that, it's\nsort of in the top right corner,\nbut it's a little bit too big.\nSo we're going to style it\njust like our design here.\nSo I'm going to move this up here actually\nso that we have a better reference.\nAnd now we're going to style\nit by first changing the font.\nLet's change the font dash family to\nreto aerial,\nlike before Next, we'll\nchange the font size.\nSo this is pretty small. Let's change\nthe font dash size to maybe 10 pixels.\nOkay, should be a little bit\nbigger. Let's set it to 12 pixels.\nThat looks pretty good. And let's add\nsome spacing on the inside of the element.\nLet's add some padding\nleft of maybe four pixels,\npadding right of four pixels,\npadding top of two,\nand padding dash bottom of two pixels.\nAnd remember to make this a circle,\nwe're going to give it round corners.\nSo let's set the border\ndash radius to 10 pixels.\nSo it looks like we're a\nlittle bit too tall here.\nWe're going to stretch out the sides\nby adding more padding to the sides.\nLet's change this to maybe\nfive pixels left and right.\nSave it. Okay, maybe six\npixels left and right.\nSave it. Okay, so that looks\nlike a pretty good circle. Next,\nwe'll change the background color\nto something that looks like that.\nSo I'm just going to pick\nsomething like this, maybe\nsave.\nPerfect.\nAnd I'm going to change the font size\ndown just a little bit more because this\nis pretty small. Let's\nchange this to 11, save that,\nand let's change the padding\nleft and the right because\nit'll, it's a little bit\nlong on the horizontal side.\nAnd now we have a circle again.\nSo notice that we put this element in\nthe top right corner using these two\nproperties, but it's not enough.\nWe actually want it out even more.\nSo we're already at the top edge of\nour position. Relative container,\nhow can we go even higher? So the\ntrick here is to use negative numbers.\nSo now this will be positioned\nbeyond the top edge of our container.\nSo if I save it here,\nthis is now five pixels beyond the\ntop edge of our relative container.\nSame thing with right, if we set\nit to negative five pixels here,\nit's now five pixels beyond the right\nedge. So I'm just going to adjust the\nvalleys here so that\nit matches our design.\nSo let's set the top to something\nlike negative two. Okay,\nso I think that looks pretty close to\nour design and I'm pretty happy with it.\nSo in this lesson, we\nlearned CSS position,\nwhich is one of the most\nimportant skills in css.\nIt allows us to create elements like\nthis header and sidebar that stick to the\npage while we scroll, and it allows us\nto add elements on top of other elements.\nFor example,\nthe video time on top of the thumbnail\nand the notification count on top of the\nnotification icon. So with that,\nwe learned all the major skills that\nwe need in H T M L and CSS to complete\nour project. In the last lesson,\nwe're going to create all the\nother features that we're missing,\nincluding the sidebar, the tooltip,\nand making our current project\nlook like the final design. Here\nin this lesson, we're going\nto finish our final project.\nWe're going to create the sidebar,\nwe'll resize our video so that it\nlooks like our design here. And lastly,\nwe're going to create the tooltip.\nWhen we hover over these icons,\nwe'll start off with the sidebar.\nSo I'm going to rearrange my windows here\nso that it's a little easier to copy.\nSo I put the design on the left.\nI'm going to put our current\nsidebar on the right here,\nand I'll resize my windows\nso we can see it better.\nAnd now we're ready to begin.\nSo let's open our code editor and\nwe're going to open YouTube dot\nhtml. And then we're going to\nscroll down to the sidebar code,\nwhich is right here.\nSo let's take a look at the design of\nthis sidebar. Our reference design.\nIf I hover over it, you can see\nthat is just a bunch of boxes.\nAnd inside each box we\nhave an icon, some text,\nand they're centered\nhorizontally and vertically.\nSo we're going to start step by step.\nWe're first going to create the box.\nLet's go into our code.\nAnd instead of this text,\nwe're going to create six boxes.\nWe're going to use a\ndiviv to create each box.\nLet's give this diviv a class of sidebar\ndash link.\nAnd I'm going to copy\nand paste this six times\n4, 5, 6. Next,\nwe're going to style these so that\nthey have the same size as these boxes.\nI'm going to go into our css.\nSo let's go into sidebar css.\nI'm going to put this on the right\nside here so we can see it better.\nAnd now we're ready to style these.\nLet's target the class sidebar link.\nAnd for each of these, let's give it a\nbackground color so that we can see them.\nAnd let's set it to light gray.\nAnd we'll also give them a height\nbecause without any content in the divs,\nthey have a height of zero.\nSo let's set a height of 50 pixels and\nlet's save it and let's\nsee how that looks. Okay,\nso it's hard to tell the\ndifference between them.\nSo let's add some spacing at the bottom\nof each div so that we can differentiate\nthem.\nI'm going to add margin dash bottom of one\npixel, save it. Okay, so from this,\nit looks like our boxes\nare a little bit too short,\nso we're going to make them taller.\nLet's try a height of maybe 75.\nOkay, so I think that's pretty close.\nWe can get rid of this margin at the\nbottom and actually increase this to\n76 so that we compensate for\nthe margin that we removed.\nAnd next, when we look at the design,\nthese boxes are usually white,\nbut when we hover over\nthem, they turn gray.\nSo instead of having this\nbackground color gray here,\nwe're just going to set the background\ncolor when we hover over this.\nSo let's set a hover style dot sidebar,\ndash link hover.\nAnd when we hover, we're going\nto set the background color to\nlight and gray. Let's save it.\nAnd now when we hover, it's light gray,\nbut our design is actually\na lot lighter than that.\nSo I'm going to change the color here.\nI'm going to pick something a little\nlighter than this, maybe something here.\nSave that and check it out.\nAnd yep,\nI think that looks pretty close.\nNext we're going to add the\ncontent in each of these boxes.\nSo first we actually need to\ndownload all of these icons.\nSo we did the before for these icons.\nAnd just a reminder to do that,\nwe're going to right click and inspect.\nSo you'll see that this\nactually covers up the sidebar.\nWhat we can do is click these three dots\nin the top right and then we can move\nthe dev tools to another\nside of the webpage.\nSo I'm going to move it\nto the right side here.\nAnd now we can see the full sidebar.\nThen we're going to click\nthis in the top left,\nclick one of these icons and you'll\nget the URL to download them here.\nSo hover over this URL\nand then click this.\nAnd now we can control S,\nand I'll save it in the folder\nthat contains my code in the icons\nfolder.\nSo make sure you do this for all six of\nthese icons and I'll see you back after\nyou're done. All right,\nso once we've downloaded all of\nthe icons from the sidebar here,\nwe're going to add them to our html.\nSo let's go into each of\nthese and add our icons\ninside this first diviv, we're\ngoing to add an image element,\nand we're going to set a source attribute.\nAnd we're going to load\nthe icon icons slash\nhome dot svg because\nthis is the home icon.\nAnd let's save it. And now we have\nour icon. It's a little bit too big,\nbut we're going to\nresize it after. For now,\nlet's copy this and add the\nicons for all of these other\nboxes. So we're going to add for this one,\nwe're going to add the\nexplore icon. So explore svg,\nand for this one is the\nsubscriptions. And then for this one,\nit's originals.\nAnd then for this one\nit's YouTube dash music.\nAnd the last one is library.\nSo I'm going to go down here,\nchange this to library. Perfect.\nNext, we're going to\nmake these icons smaller.\nSo usually we would set a\nclass on these images so\nthat we can style them with css.\nBut for this lesson I'm going to show\nyou another wave that we can target these\nimages.\nSo let's go into our sidebar styles\nand we're going to learn a new CSS\ntechnique.\nSo we already learned that this\ntext before the brackets here,\nthis tells a computer which elements\nwe're styling. In this case,\nthe dot means we're targeting a class\nand we're styling all elements that have\nthe class sidebar link,\nwhich are these elements.\nSo this bit of text is\ncalled a CSS selector,\nand there's actually a lot of different\nselectors that we can use in css.\nSo we already learned\nthe class name selector,\nwhich looks like this\nand starts with a dot.\nAnd we learned the element name selector,\nwhich just starts with the elements name.\nAnother thing we can do with CSS is to\ncombine selectors together. For example,\nif we said dot sidebar,\ndash link and then\nwrote a comma down here,\nwe can add another selector.\nSo let's say we also\nwant to target header.\nSo now all of the styles inside the\nbrackets will target all elements with the\nsidebar link class and all\nelements with the header class.\nThis is an example of a\nmore advanced selector.\nAnother selector we can\nuse is instead of a comma,\nwe can use a space and\nthen type another selector\nlike image. So when we have\na space between these two,\nthis means that we're targeting all\nimages inside all sidebar links.\nSo we're going to target these\nimages inside sidebar links only.\nWe're not going to target\nall images on the page.\nSo let's style these images and make\nthem smaller. We're going to set a height\nand let's try 24 pixels.\nLet's see how that looks. Okay,\nso I think that looks pretty close\nto what we have in the design. Next,\nwe're going to center these\nhorizontally and vertically.\nAnd finally add the text.\nSo to center something vertically\nis actually challenging In css,\nthe best way to do it is to use a flexbox.\nIf we look into our code editor\nand open our Flexbox example,\nso flexbox html,\nand then we right click\nand open with live server,\nwe have a bunch of\nexamples of using flexbox.\nIn the last example here we're\ndoing vertical alignment.\nIf we scroll down to\nour example in our html,\nwe have this property\ncalled align items center.\nSo this vertically\ncenters our content here.\nWe also have an example\nof horizontal centering.\nIf we scroll up to that\nexample, which is this one,\nwe have the property\njustified content center.\nSo using justified content\ncenter and Align item center,\nwe can put it both horizontally\nand vertically centered.\nSo let's go back into our project\nand use a flex box to center these.\nWe're going to go back to our CSS\nand we're going to make each of\nthese sidebar links a flex box.\nSo let's set the display property to flex,\nand we're going to set\njustify dash content\nto center. So this will center\nhorizontally, let's save it.\nAnd now they're horizontally centered.\nAnd then align dash items center for\nvertical center. So this\nis coming along great.\nNext we're going to add the text.\nSo underneath each of these,\nlet's add a diviv. So for this first one,\nit's going to be called home.\nAnd I'm just going to copy these\nand replace it with each\nof these texts. So explore\nthis one is subscriptions,\noriginals,\nYouTube,\nmusic and library.\nNow let's start styling\nthis text a little bit.\nI'm going to use this\nadvanced CSS selector. Again,\nwe're going to go into\nthe sidebar link class,\nand then we're going to target\nall the divs inside sidebar link.\nSo we're going to target divs.\nSo this is not going to\ntarget all divs on the page,\nonly the divs inside sidebar link.\nLet's change the font here first.\nSo we'll set the font dash family to reto\naerial like before, and let's\nmake the text smaller. Next,\nwe're going to set the font\ndash size to maybe 12 pixels.\nOkay, maybe 10 pixels, save it.\nAnd now the next problem we have is that\nour elements are appearing beside each\nother, not on top of each\nother. So why is this happening?\nSo remember that we can set a\nproperty called flex dash direction\ncolon row.\nIf we go into our flex\nbox example, Flexbox html,\nlet we scroll all the way to the top.\nThis was the first thing that we learned.\nDisplay flex and flex direction row.\nSo if we open this in our browser\nand we scroll to the first example,\nflex direction row causes our\nelements to be displayed horizontally.\nSo notice that these two are divs, but\nthey're displayed next to each other,\nnot on top of each other. Now to change\nthis, we're actually going to go back\nand we're going to use\nflex direction column.\nSo where flex direction row\ndisplays them horizontally,\nflex direction column displays our\nelements vertically. So if we save it\nnow it's displaying our elements\none on top of each other.\nSo this is another direction that we\ncan use for our flex boxes. By default,\nflex boxes are flex direction row,\nso they will appear horizontally,\nbut we can set flex direction column\nwhen we don't want that behavior.\nSo for flex direction column, these\ntwo properties are actually switched.\nSo if I remove both of\nthem first and I first use\njustify dash content colon center,\nSave it.\nJustify content now affects the\nvertical direction instead of the\nhorizontal direction\nwith flex direction row.\nAnd if I use align dash items,\ncenter align items now affects\nthe horizontal direction.\nSo for flex direction column,\nthese two are reversed.\nIt's a little bit confusing,\nbut the more they use flex box,\nthe more you'll get used to it.\nAll right, so we're almost done.\nWe're just going to add some space\nbetween these two to add some space.\nLet's add some margin bottom to the image.\nSo margin dash bottom,\nmaybe four pixels, save it.\nOkay, I think that looks\npretty close to me,\nand it looks like our elements\nare a little bit too tall.\nSo I'm actually going to scroll up and\nadjust the height here to maybe 74.\nSave it. And okay, that looks pretty good.\nSo one last thing with the sidebar is\nthat I notice in our design it kind of\ncovers the header while ours does not.\nSo to change that,\nremember we can change\nthe Z dash index to be\nhigher than whatever the header is.\nSo if we go into our header styles,\nheader dot css, notice\nthat the Z index is 100.\nSo we're going to change our\nZ index to bigger than that.\nSo 200 save it.\nAnd now our sidebar is\ncovering our header. Next,\nI want to move all of these icons down\na little bit more so that it's aligned.\nSo to do that, I'm going to add some\npadding or spacing to the top of this.\nSo we're going to add some padding\ndash top of maybe five pixels.\nLet's see how that looks.\nOkay, so that looks perfect.\nAnd actually one last thing is I'm going\nto make the cursor a pointer when we\nhover her over it.\nSo let's go into our sidebar\nlink and we'll set the cursor\nto a pointer, save it.\nAnd now this looks good to go.\nNext we're going to resize these\nvideos to match the design.\nSo I'm going to move\nthis back into one window\nand I'm going to resize this so that we\nhave three videos in each row and now\nwe can properly switch\nback and forth to compare.\nSo as I switch back and\nforth between these,\nyou can see that there's a size\ndifference between the videos.\nSo we're going to fix\nthat. So for our website,\nI notice that the left edge here can\nbe moved to the right a little more.\nSo if we look at our design,\nit's more to the right,\ngo back to our current project\ndesign more to the right.\nSo to move this to the right,\nwe're actually using padding.\nSo we had to increase our padding\non the left side of the page.\nLet's go back into our code and\nwe're going to find the padding,\nwhich is in general css.\nSo remember we added padding to the left\nside of the body that's pushing these\nelements over here.\nSo let's increase the padding to maybe\n96,\nsave it and let's compare\nit to the design. All right,\nso I think that looks perfect.\nAnd we also have padding on the\nright while our website does not.\nSo let's actually also\nadd padding dash right\nof 24 pixels.\nNow if we save that there\nand compare it to our design,\nour videos are now exactly the right\nsize. So that looks great to me.\nThe next thing we're going to\ntweak is if we look at our design,\nthe background color here is a light\ngray while our background color is white.\nSo we're going to make the background\ncolor of our entire page a shade of gray\nlike this.\nSo let's go into our CSS\nand in our body styles in\ngeneral css,\nlet's set the background dash color to\nlight gray.\nAnd I'm going to hover over\nthis and select a lighter color,\nmaybe 2 48. Save it.\nAnd let's compare it to our design.\nSo this is our website and this is the\ndesign. I think that looks pretty close.\nAnd the last few details I\nwant to adjust is this part.\nSo if I look at my design and\nI compare it to my website,\nit looks like our channel\npictures are a little bit too big.\nSo if I look at the design here, so\nwe could make them a little smaller.\nSo let's go into our code and\nwe're going to go into the video\nstyles. Let's open video css.\nWe're going to find the profile\npicture. So if I scroll down,\nso this image here is the channel picture.\nIt has a class of profile picture.\nWe're going to decrease\nthe width to maybe 36,\nsave it compared to our design.\nSo I think that's the right size. Next,\nI'm going to adjust some of these spacing\nhere. So if I compare to the design,\nthere's actually a little bit less\nspacing here, then our website.\nSo I'm going to decrease\nthat. So for our website,\nwe're adding some margin\nbottom to the thumbnail.\nThe thumbnail row.\nI'm going to decrease this to maybe\neight pixels. Let's see how that looks.\nAnd then compared to our design,\nso I'm pretty happy with that.\nAnd finally, I'm going to adjust\nthe spacing between these two.\nSo for our video title,\nif we go into our code\nAnd scroll up here, it\nhas a margin bottom of 12.\nI'm going to decrease\nit a little bit to 10,\nsave it and compare it. Okay,\nso I think that's good enough.\nIt doesn't have to be perfect,\nit's a little bit off,\nbut I think that our current website\nhere looks really good to me. Anyways,\nthe final thing we're going to do in this\nlesson is we're going to create these\ntooltip when we hover over these icons.\nSo before we learn how to make\nthese appear, when we hover over,\nlet's just create these tooltip\nand place them below each icon.\nSo let's go into our website and we're\ngoing to add some tooltip to these.\nSo we'll go into our code and I'm going\nto resize the windows so we can see\nbetter. So we're going\nto go into our html,\nwe're going to scroll up to our header.\nAnd let's first find the search icon here,\nwhich is in the middle section,\nand then the search button here.\nSo to create the tooltip,\nwe're actually going to use the position\nproperty that we learned earlier.\nSo remember that we use position to put\nthis number in the top right corner.\nWe're going to use position to put a\ntool tip below the element right here.\nSo let's first add a tool\ntip inside the button.\nSo we're going to create a diviv\nand let's call this search, let's save it.\nAnd now that's our tool tip.\nAnd now we need to position this\ntool tip relative to our button.\nSo remember from the previous lesson,\nwe need position absolute\ninside position relative.\nSo let's first add those\nposition properties.\nSo we're going to go into the header\nCSS file because we're working with the\nheader. So let's open that up\nand I'm going to move it\nto the right side here.\nAnd now we're going to scroll down\nuntil we find our search button.\nSo I'm going to scroll, scroll,\nscroll, and it's right here.\nSo we're going to set this search button,\nwhich is our container to position\nColon relative save it,\nand nothing happens because that's\nhow position relative works.\nAnd now the magic comes when we\nset this to position absolute.\nSo we're actually going to set a class\nhere so that we can target it a little\neasier. We're going to call this tool tip\nand we're going to use that advanced\nCSS selector we learned earlier.\nSo we're going to target\nsearch dash button first,\nand then we're going to type a space.\nAnd then we're going to type tool tip.\nSo this means that we're\ntargeting the dot tool tip class,\nnot on the entire page, but\nonly inside the search button.\nSo now we don't have to come up with a\nunique name for this specific tool tip.\nSo if we save it, we're\ngoing to set this to position\nabsolute. And now we have an absolute\nelement inside a relative element.\nSo if we save that, now we\ncan start positioning this.\nLet's give a background color\nso that we can see it better.\nSo background dash color of maybe gray.\nAnd let's add the text color\nto white. So color colon white.\nLet's give it some padding on the inside,\nsome padding top of maybe four pixels,\npadding dash bottom,\nfour pixels padding left four pixels\nand padding right for pixels, save it.\nAnd let's actually increase the\npadding on the left and right to eight.\nSee how that looks. Okay,\nI'm pretty happy with that.\nAnd now I'm going to set some rounded\ncorners so we don't have to exactly match\nour design. We can make it close enough\nso we can set some rounded corners,\nborder dash radius of four pixels.\nIt's a little too much\nfor me set to two pixels.\nAnd I'm also going to make\nthe font a little bit smaller.\nSo I'm going to set the\nfont dash size to 12 pixels.\nSave it. I think that\nlooks pretty good to me.\nNext we're going to\nuse the property's top,\nbottom left and right to position\nthis within the relative element.\nSo for our cases, let's\nstart with bottom zero.\nSo this means that the bottom of our\ntooltip will be at the bottom of the\nbutton. If I save this,\nthat's exactly what we have.\nNow to move it even further to the bottom,\nwe're going to use negative pixels.\nSo let's set negative 20. Save it.\nOkay, so I think that's\nlooking pretty good.\nLet's increase it a little bit more,\nincrease it to 30 pixels, save it.\nOkay, so I'm happy with that position.\nNow we're going to learn how to make this\ntooltip appear when we hover over this\nbutton.\nSo the trick here is we're going to\nset the opacity or how see through\nthe tooltip is to zero, which\nis completely invisible.\nAnd then when we hover over this button,\nwe're going to set the opacity to one.\nSo how do we actually change this\nwhen we hover over the button?\nSo we're actually going to use a\ncombination of this advanced CSS\nand pseudo classes which are like hover.\nSo first we're going to target\nthe search dash button class,\nand we're going to add a\npseudo class colon hover.\nAnd now we're going to type\nanother selector. We're\ngoing to type dot tool tip,\nand we're going to set some styles here.\nSo what this does is that we're going\nto target the tool tips only when we're\nhovering over this search button.\nSo up here notice that we're targeting\nthe tool tips inside the search button,\nregardless of whether if we're\nhovering over it or not. In this case,\nwe're going to target all\ntooltip inside the search button,\nbut only when we hover over\nit. So when we hover over it,\nwe can set the tooltip opacity\nTo one.\nSo this is a neat trick that you\ncan do to create tooltip like this.\nSo if we go into our webpage when\nI'm not hovering over the button,\nyou'll notice that the opacity is zero.\nBut when I'm hovering over the button,\nthis tooltip will have an opacity\nof one which looks like this.\nAnd now because we're changing the\nopacity, we can set a transition.\nSo let's set a transition. We need\nto tell that what to transition,\nwhich is opacity and how long\nthe transition will take.\nLet's say 0.15 seconds, save it.\nAnd when we hover over this,\nnow we get our tooltip.\nNow the last thing I want to show you\nis if we hover over the actual tooltip,\nyou'll notice that because\nit's inside this button,\nwhen we hover over the\ntooltip with our mouse,\nit also counts as\nhovering over the button.\nWe can fix this by disabling hovers on\nthe tooltip and only allow hovers on the\nbutton. So to disable the\nhover on this tooltip,\nwe're going to use another\nCSS property called pointer\nEvents none.\nThis means that when our\nmouse hovers over the tooltip,\nit's not going to do anything.\nSo that's how we create\nthese tooltip on our webpage.\nLet's do the same thing with\nthis voice search button.\nWe're going to go into our HTML and\nwe're just going to copy this tool tip\nand just move it down here into the\nvoice search button, just like that.\nAnd let's change the text\nto search with your voice,\nSave it. And now remember\nto position this,\nwe're going to have position\nabsolute inside position relative.\nSo let's turn this to\nposition relative first.\nI'm actually going to\nmake it easier for us.\nI'm going to first target\nthe search dash button,\nand I'm going to put this inside here.\nAnd I'm also going to target with a comma,\nthe voice search button. So this one,\nnow this code is going to\napply to both of these,\nso it saves us a little bit of\ncoding. Same thing down here.\nWe're going to apply all of these\nstyles to the search button,\ntooltip and comma,\nthe voice search button dot tooltip.\nSo using these advanced CSS\nselectors can save us a lot of code.\nWe're going to scroll down all\nthe way here to and use a comma\nand set this to the voice\nsearch button. So make sure you don't\nhave a comma at the end there. Save it.\nNow when I hover over this,\nyou'll notice that it doesn't really\nwork because the text is sort of wrapping\naround.\nI'm going to fix that by setting\nthis property white space,\nno wrap, save it.\nAnd this will prevent the\ntext from wrapping around.\nNow the last thing I want to do is do\ncenter this tool tip with the button.\nTo do this,\nwe can use a flex box because remember\nwith flex box we can center horizontally\nand vertically. In this case,\nwe want to center horizontally.\nSo we're going to make we're scroll up\nand we're going to make these buttons\nflex boxes.\nSo let's set display flex. By default,\nit's flex direction row.\nSo justify content is going\nto center horizontally.\nSo justify content center, save it.\nSo now if we hover over our buttons,\nyou'll notice that the tooltip\nare aligned horizontally,\nbut you also notice that our icons are\nnot vertically aligned very well. So\nlet's go back into our code and we're\ngoing to align them in the center with\nalign dash items center, save it.\nSo that didn't seem to work, but\nif we scroll down into our code,\nso way earlier in the course,\nwe actually added margin top\nto the search icon as well as\nthe voice search icon.\nSo we just need to get rid of this margin\ntop and let the flex box handle the\nvertical centering. So if we save that,\nnow the icons are perfectly\ncentered and if we hover over,\nwe have a centered tooltip.\nThe tooltips for these\nicons are the same thing,\nexcept if we scroll down, we\ncurrently just have an image.\nWe're going to need a container like\nthis that's going to act as our position\nrelative container. So\nlet's create a diviv\nthat's going to contain our upload icon.\nLet's cut this and then paste it in here.\nLet's give a class of upload dash\nicon dash container.\nAnd then inside this container\nwe're going to have our tool tip.\nSo let's copy this and\nthen paste it in here.\nAnd let's call this, let's\nlook at our design create.\nSo our tooltip is going\nto have the text create.\nNext.\nWe're going to change this to position\nrelative and position absolute inside.\nSo let's scroll up.\nAnd we already have this code here that\nsets to position relative and centers\neverything. And we're going to\nadd to this the upload icon,\ncontainer dot upload,\ndash icon, dash container,\nsave it.\nAnd then we need a position\nabsolute on this tool tip. So again,\nwe can just add it in here so we don't\nhave to copy all this code again with a\ncomma dot upload dash\nicon, dash container,\ntooltip save it.\nAnd lastly, we're going to\nscroll down and add it to here.\nSo that appears when we hover.\nSo let's set dot upload dash icon,\ncontainer and dot. When we hover over it,\nthe tooltip is going\nto have opacity of one.\nLet's save it and hover over. All\nright, so that looks pretty good,\nbut let's change the font here.\nSo let's go into this code\nwhich sets our tooltip\nstyles,\nand let's set the font dash family to reto\naerial. Like before. If we\nsave it and we hover over it,\nnow we have a nice looking\ntooltip on our icons.\nSo that's how we create these tooltip.\nWhen we hover over these\nicons and these buttons,\ncreating tooltip for these two\nother icons are the same thing,\nand I'm going to leave it as an\nexercise for you to do on your own.\nSo in this lesson, we\nfinished up our final project.\nWe created the sidebar resize,\nour videos created the tooltip,\nand now if we compare it to our design,\nour project looks pretty\nmuch perfect and ready to go.\nSo here's some exercises you can try on\nyour own to wrap up everything that we\nlearned in this course.\nIn the previous lesson, we finished\nour final project, which is this.\nIn this lesson I'm going to show you\nsome more useful features of c s s.\nWe're going to start off\nwith responsive design.\nIf we go to our reference design here,\nand I'm going to zoom out a little\nbit so you can see if I make the page\nsmaller, you'll notice that we\nnow have two videos in each row.\nIf I make the page bigger,\nwe have four videos.\nSo notice that at every screen size,\nthe layout adjusts so that\nthe website looks good.\nSo that's the idea of responsive design,\nmaking the website look as good as\npossible on every screen size. Now,\nif we make this a little bit more narrow\nand we switch to our current project,\nyou'll notice that all of our\ncontent is sort of squished.\nSo we're going to learn how to implement\nresponsive design into our project.\nLet's go into our code and\nwe're going to open the file\ncalled video dot css, which\ncontrols the video grid styles.\nLet's open that.\nAnd now inside we're going to adjust\nour video grid so that when the screen\nsize is small, we only have two videos\nper row. And when the screen size is big,\nwe have more than three videos per row.\nSo let's go into our code and we're\ngoing to scroll down and find the video\ngrid styles. So notice\nthat for these styles,\nwe set three columns of equal size.\nNow to make this responsive, we're going\nto use something called a media query.\nSo to create a media query,\nwe're going to type at media,\nand then we're going to\ngive it a screen size.\nSo we're going to say max dash with colon,\nmaybe 600 pixels.\nAnd then we're going to\ntype open squiggly bracket,\nand then close quickly bracket.\nSo the way this works is that we're\ngoing to have a bunch of CSS in here,\nand this CSS will only activate\nif the screen size is 600\npixels or less. That's what this\nmax width means. So for example,\nlet's target the video\ngrid class inside here\nand let's set the grid dash template,\ndash columns to one fr, one Fr.\nThat means from a screen\nsize of zero to 600 pixels,\nwe're only going to have two columns.\nSo we save it and we start to resize.\nNotice that once we get to 600 pixels,\nwe now have two columns in our grid.\nNow to figure out how\nbig our screen size is,\nwe can right click and inspect,\nand I'm going to click these three dots\nand move it back down to the bottom like\nthis. And now when we resize,\nyou should see the screen size\nat the top right of the page.\nSo it's really up to us to pick a screen\nsize where we're going to go from three\ncolumns to two.\nSo I think even at this screen size,\nmaybe at seven 50, it looks\na little bit squished.\nSo I'm going to increase\nthis to 750 pixels.\nLet's save it. And now\nonce we get to seven 50,\nwe're going to have two videos in each\nrow and it's not going to be as squished\nanymore.\nSo that's the basics of how to create\nresponsive designs using these media\nqueries. Let's do another example.\nWe're going to have four videos per row\nwhen our screen size gets really big.\nSo let's set another at media. At media.\nAnd for this time we're going\nto set a minimum width of\nmaybe a thousand pixels.\nAnd then inside here we're going\nto copy this and paste it here.\nWe're going to change grid template\ncolumns to four columns. So one f fr,\none fr.\nNow if we save it and we\nresize the browser to 1000\npixels, it's going to\nbecome four videos per row.\nNow you might need to press command or\ncontrol minus to make the webpage smaller\nto see this,\nbut basically the way this works is that\nonce the screen size hits a thousand\npixels, this will activate and we\nhave four columns instead of three.\nSo the last example is that we\ncan actually combine these two,\nso we can set at media and we can set the\nmin dash width to 7 51 pixels\nand the max dash width to\n9 99 pixels.\nSo this will cover the space\nbetween these two measurements here.\nSo let's actually put this in the middle.\nSo from zero pixels to a max of seven\n50, we're going to have these styles.\nAnd then from 7 51 to 9 99,\nwe're going to have these styles. So\nwe're going to set this to three columns,\nand then from a thousand and up,\nwe're going to have four columns.\nSo this is the basics of how to\ncreate a responsive design like this.\nYou just have to write a lot\nof media queries. All right,\nso that's the basics of responsive design.\nWe're going to go back to our webpages.\nI'm just going to zoom back in and\nwe'll learn the next feature of css.\nSo let's go to our project\nhere and open our code.\nAnd let's scroll down to\nthis dial the video time.\nSo the next feature we're going to\nlearn is sort of like CSS shortcuts.\nSo instead of setting padding on the left,\nright top and bottom separately like this,\nwe can actually use a\nproperty called padding,\nwhich is sort of like a\nshortcut for all four of these.\nSo if we set the padding to four pixels,\nthis is the same as setting\npadding on all four sides.\nSo we don't need this code anymore.\nSo it makes it a little cleaner for our\ncode to use these shorthand properties.\nSo another thing we can do with\nthis is we can have two values,\nlet's say four pixels\nand 10 pixels. Save it.\nSo this first value is going to be\nthe vertical padding. So padding top,\npadding bottom, and the second value\nis horizontal padding, padding,\nleft and padding right?\nThe next thing we can do\nis have four directions.\nSo 20 pixels and 30 pixels.\nLet's see how that looks.\nSo this is how we can set padding in all\nfour directions using one line of css.\nThis first value is the padding top\nsecond value is the padding, right?\nThird value is padding bottom,\nand fourth is padding left.\nYou can think of this as first you start\nfrom the top and then you work your way\nclockwise around. So that's\nwhat these four values mean.\nAnother shorthand property is margin,\nand this is a substitute\nfor margin, left margin,\nright margin top and margin bottom.\nSo this margin shorthand property\nworks the same way as padding.\nIf we have one value, this is all four\ndirections. If we have two values,\nthis first value is the\nvertical direction. Second\nis a horizontal direction,\nand if we have four values of margin,\nthis is the top right bottom and left.\nSo these are just examples.\nWe're going to move our styles back to\nfour pixels of padding on every side,\nand we're going to look at one final\nshorthand property, which is the border.\nSo let's go into our header CSS file\nand find these styles for this search\nbar. So we're going to scroll\nup until we find our search bar,\nwhich is here. And notice for our\nborders, we always set a width,\na border style, and a border color.\nSo instead of setting\nthese styles separately,\nwe can use a shorthand\ncalled border. So for border,\nwe can set one pixel. This\nis going to be the width.\nWe can set another value of solid.\nThis is going to be the border style,\nand we can set the third value of color.\nAnd so this one line of CSS\ncan replace these three.\nIf we delete that, then we save.\nYou can see that everything\nstill appears normally,\nand that's because this border property\nis a shorthand for the other three.\nThe next thing we're going to\nlearn is called inheritance.\nLet's go to our YouTube dot HTML\nfile and we're going to scroll\ndown to the video grid,\nwhich is right here.\nSo inheritance means that\nfor certain CSS properties,\nif we set the property\non the outer element,\nit will get passed down to the inner\nelements like these. Let's do an example.\nWe're going to set a\nproperty on the video grid.\nWe're going to go to the video CSS file,\nand we're going to find the video\ngrid styles, which is all of these.\nWe're going to set it on this style here.\nSo we're going to set it for all\nscreen sizes. Let's add a style.\nWe're going to make the\ntext underlined. To do that,\nwe're going to use this\nproperty text dash decoration\nunderline. Now if I save this,\nyou'll see that even though I set text\ndecoration, underline on the video grid,\nall of the paragraphs\ninside have been underlined.\nSo this is called inheritance.\nIf we set this style on the outer\nelement, which is the video grid,\nit gets passed down to\nall the inner elements,\nwhich are the paragraphs here. However,\nnot all properties are affected\nby inheritance. For example,\nif we go back to the video CSS file,\nand we're going to add a border this time.\nSo let's add a border and we're\ngoing to make it two pixels wide,\na solid color, and let's just make it red.\nAnd if I save that, you'll see that\nthe video grid has a border around it,\nbut this border is not passed\ndown to the inner elements here.\nSo inheritance mostly just works with\ntext properties like text decoration,\nunderlying color, font,\nweight, and font family.\nIt doesn't affect things like\nborder padding or margin,\nso that's what inheritance\nmeans. Certain properties,\nmostly text properties will get passed\ndown from the outer element to the\ninner elements. Now, this can\nsave us some code. For example,\nif we go back to the video dot\nCSS file and we scroll down,\nyou can see that the video time uses a\nstyle called font family reto aerial.\nSo this changes the font of our text,\nand instead of putting\nit on the video time,\nwe're just going to put\nit on the entire grid,\nand then it will get inherited\nby all the elements inside,\nwhich includes the video time.\nSo I can scroll up to the video\ngrid and I can set the font\ndash family up here so I can set Roto\nAriel. If I save this,\nyou'll see that nothing changed with\nthe video time because this style is\nbeing inherited from the video grid. Now,\nwe can actually take this even further.\nIf we go to the YouTube dot html file,\nyou'll see that this video grid is\nactually contained within the entire\nbody. So all of our elements on the\npage are contained within the body.\nSo if we want to set a sort of\ndefault textile on the entire page,\nwe can actually just put everything in\nthe body and that'll save us a lot of\ncode. So let's actually go\nback to the video CSS file.\nWe're going to remove this and save it.\nYou'll see that the video time\nnow goes back to the default font,\nwhich is times New Roman,\nand these paragraphs actually\nuse a different set of styles.\nSo if we go to the file\ncalled General css,\nwe set the font family for\nthese paragraphs using just a p\nselector here. If we remove this\nand save it,\nyou'll see that it goes back to the\ndefault font of times new enrollment.\nNow we're going to set this style on\nthe body so that it gets inherited\nto the entire webpage inside.\nSo we'll go to General\ncss and we're going to set\nfont dash family to Reto\naerial to take advantage of\ninheritance. If I save this,\nyou'll see that all of the\nfonts went back to robo,\nand that's because we set it on the body\nand all of our elements are inside the\nbody. So this style gets\ninherited to the inner elements.\nSo using this,\nwe can save more code if we go\nto our sidebar and our header.\nIf I go to the sidebar first,\nyou'll notice that we're also\nusing font family roboto aerial.\nSo we can simply get rid of this because\nthis style is being inherited from the\nbody.\nAnd if I go to the header dot css,\nyou'll notice that we're also using Fond\nfamily Reto AO in a bunch of places.\nSo we can just get rid of all\nof these and take advantage of\ninheritance to save us some code.\nAll right, so there's one last thing\nabout inheritance that I want to show you.\nWe're going to go back to our video\nCSS file, which is right here.\nAnd now let's get rid of these\nproperties that we are using to test with\nSave it. This time we're\ngoing to go to General css.\nWe're going to set\nanother style in the body,\nand we're going to set\nthe property color red to\nchange the text color of the\nentire page to red. If I save it,\nyou'll see that a lot\nof the text is now red,\nlike these sidebar and the video titles,\nbut not all of the text has been turned\nto red. So why is this happening?\nWe mentioned this in one\nof our earlier lessons.\nCSS follows a sort of priority when\nyou set the same style on the same\nelement.\nSo for these video author\nand video stats paragraphs,\nfirst we set a color of red from the\nbody, so that gets inherited down.\nBut then if we look at the\nCSS for these in video CSS and\ngo into the video author,\nwhich is right here,\nyou can see that we also set the\ncolor to this gray color. So the\ncolor is being set both by these styles\nand by these styles that are inherited\nfrom the body. However,\nthis style is more specific because it\nonly targets the video author and the\nvideo stats while the style in\nthe body targets the entire page.\nSo that's why this style has higher\npriority than the inherited style.\nThis is called CSS specificity. Generally,\nif we set these same style on the same\nelements like we have in this situation,\nthe style that is more\nspecific, for example,\nthis style targets only the\nvideo author and video stats,\nthe style that is more\nspecific has higher priority,\nand it will override a more general\nstyle, which is what we have here.\nSo using inheritance and specificity,\nwe're able to both set a default\nstyle on the outer element,\nand then if we need to,\nwe can go to the inner element\nand then override that style.\nNow in this course,\nwe didn't go through a lot of detail\nabout specificity and its rules,\nand that's because we were mostly\nfocused on building out this project,\nbut you can find all the details about\nspecificity in the HTML and CSS reference\nbelow the video. For now,\nlet's go back into general\nCSS and let's get rid of this\npractice style that we were using,\nand now we're ready to move on.\nNext, we're going to learn\nabout semantic elements.\nIf we go back to our\nYouTube dot html file,\nso we learned about a bunch of\nelements like the diviv, the image,\nand the button. There's also another set\nof elements called semantic elements.\nSo for example, header\nis a semantic element,\nand another example is the nav element.\nSo these elements actually\nwork the same way as a diviv,\nexcept they have a special meaning\nto screen readers, search engines,\nand any other kind of device or\nrobot that is reading our webpage.\nSo to have the structure of our webpage\nrecognized correctly in a screen reader,\nwe should actually replace some of\nour divs with semantic elements.\nSo for example, we can remove this\ndiviv and replace it with a header.\nSo it works the same way as a\ndiviv, except it's for the robots.\nSo let's scroll down. We're\ngoing to turn this into a header,\nand then we can also\nscroll down to our sidebar,\nand we're going to change\nthis to a nav element because\nthe sidebar on the real YouTube should\nhelp us navigate through the website.\nAnother semantic element\nwe can use is called main.\nSo this should contain the\nmain contents of your website,\nwhich for us is this part.\nWe're going to move everything inside here\nTo the main\nelement. So I think it's this\nI might be missing. Okay, so\nmove all of that into Maine,\nand let's scroll back up. Now,\ninside Maine, we're going\nto have a video grid,\nbut we might also have other\nthings below the video grid.\nSo the video grid is known as\na section of our main content.\nLet's save that and scroll all the\nway down to the end of our video grid\nand remove this with section.\nSo that's how Symantec elements\nwork. They're just the same as divs,\nexcept they give a special meaning and\nstructure to our page for search engines\nand screen readers. Now,\nthe final thing I want to show you in\nthis course is how to write comments.\nSo comments are pieces of code\nthat the computer ignores,\nbut you can read yourself to remind\nyou of information or to tell yourself\nwhat's going on in the\ncode. So for example,\nif we scroll up to our header,\nmaybe I forgot how we\ncreated this tool tip.\nSo we can actually add a comment\nin the code that reminds us.\nSo let's add a comment here.\nWe're going to type less\nthan exclamation dash, dash,\nand we're going to end the comment\nwith dash greater than like this.\nSo this is a comment.\nIf I save the webpage,\nyou'll see that this text\nappears nowhere on the webpage,\nand that's because the computer\nbasically ignores comments.\nSo we can add comments like put position,\nabsolute inside position\nrelative to remind us that we\nneed to put a position absolute inside\na position relative to create this\ntool tip in css. We also have comments.\nSo for example, if we go here,\nwe can write a comment by writing\nslash star and ending it with\nstar slash. Now, everything\nin between here is a comment.\nSo we can say this style below will be\ninherited. So as you can see comments,\nadd extra information into our\ncode without affecting our webpage.\nSo it's a really useful tool when you're\nworking on a team to document how your\ncode works. And now, for everything\nin this course, if you ever forget,\nremember that you can always Google\nit. For example, if I go to Google,\nI can search things like\nCSS rounded corners,\nand it will give us the\nborder radius property.\nI can also search for something\nlike css, text Don't wrap,\nand it will give us the white\nspace property and the valley white\nspace, no wrap. So this is\nhow you learn from here.\nYou take the techniques that\nwe learn in this course,\nsuch as the [inaudible] technique,\nusing grid, flexbox and position,\nand then you try to recreate things\nthat you see on the internet.\nAnd if you ever forget, you can Google\nand get the exact code that you need.\nSo now that we learned all the major\nskills that we need to build complex\nwebsites like YouTube,\nhere are some challenge exercises that\nyou can do to create other popular\nwebsites on your own.\nThanks so much for taking\nthis course with me.\nI hope you now realize that creating\nwebsites is not as intimidating as it\nseems.\nWe just need to create each part of the\nwebsite step by step using the major\nfeatures of HTML and CSS that\nwe learned in this course. Now,\nwhere do we go from here as the next step?\nI recommend learning the\nJavaScript programming language.\nJavaScript is what makes our\nwebpage interactive. For example,\nif we click something, type some\ntext or drag something onto the page,\nJavaScript is what updates our page.\nSo it's a natural progression\nfrom HTML and css. Now,\nif you want to learn JavaScript,\nI have a full JavaScript course for\nabsolute beginners that you can find by\nclicking on this link. Again,\nthanks so much. For watching.\nMy name is Simon from Super simple.dev.\nI want to make a tech career possible\nfor anyone. If you have any comments,\nquestions, or feedback, please leave\nthem down in the comments section below.\nIf you want to support this channel\nand you want more courses like this,\nplease click the subscribe button.
