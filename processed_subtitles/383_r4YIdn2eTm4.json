  "text": "[Music]\nhello everyone\ntoday we're going to talk about aws in\n10 minutes\nlet's look at the agenda here\nlet's talk about what aws is\nwhy it's such a big hit\nwe'll have a look at the overview of the\nservices we'll see how much it costs\nhow big it is\nand what the future of aws is\nso\nwhat is aws\neveryone is talking about amazon web\nservices but let's have a look at what\nit is\nit's basically a global cloud platform\nwhich allows you to host and manage\nservices on the internet\nit's used by almost eighty percent of\nfortune 500 companies to host their\ninfrastructure and it has a lot of\nservices which it provides to its\ncustomers\nthere's infrastructure service which\nmeans they provide bare servers as a\nservice so you don't need to manage the\nbackup and the power supply of the\nservice\nthey provide platform of the service\nyou can get java ruby php as a service\nso that you don't have to manage the\nbinaries of these applications\nyou get software as a service wherein\nyou get email sending capabilities like\nses\nyou get queuing services like sqs and\nit's a cloud storage platform wherein\nyou have a lot of storage options\nincluding ebs and s3 so all in all aws\nis a hosting provider which gives you a\nlot of services wherein you can run your\napplications on the cloud\nnow let's take a look at why it's such a\nbig hit\nso everyone is trying to use aws\neveryone is trying to put their\napplications on the cloud\nso what's the reason that aws is the top\nprovider and the top choice for doing\nanything on the cloud\none of the biggest reasons is the\nbilling\nso the billing is very clear you get a\nper hour billing\nevery instance or every service has a\nmicro billing so be it instances on ec2\nyou get per hour billing rate which is\nvery transparent\neven s3 buckets are charged on a per gb\nbasis although it is a storage service\nbut still there is micro billing\navailable there\nthe sign up process is easy you don't\nneed to sign any agreement nothing you\njust go\nsign up with an email id add a credit\ncard and you're good to go\nyou can go from zero to 100 in just two\nminutes\nyou can launch your servers big machines\nwithout buying hardware without\nprocuring any hardware you can just be\nup and running in minutes\nso their billing dashboard is also very\nsimple\nthey give you an integrated billing\ndashboard which gives you reports\nyou can pull out reports every month\nyou can pull out reports based on\nservices based on various parameters\nfor the cloud provider to be a hit you\nneed it to be stable it has to be a\ntrusted thing\nso their services are quite stable\nin the last seven or eight years they\nhave seen some three or four major\noutages but those have been only region\nspecific\nso that means out of the 12 or 13\nregions in which they operate the\noutages have been region specific in a\nparticular country or continent and\nthose also have not been more than two\nor three hours and have not affected all\nof their customers\nit's a trusted vendor so when we talk\nabout aws it comes up as something which\nis used by everyone in the industry\nfrom small startups to big enterprises\neveryone sees amazon as a trusted\nadvisor\nnow let's have an overview of the most\ncommonly used services\nso the first and the most commonly used\nservice is ec2 which is elastic compute\ncloud\nthis is the service which gives you bare\nservers so this service will give you a\nmachine which you can launch and you can\nrun your software on those\nyou can get small or big machines based\non your requirements\nthe second choice is vpc\nso amazon will not allow you full\ncontrol of their cloud instead they give\nyou chunks of their cloud which is vpc\nor the virtual private cloud\nso vpc lets you create networks in the\ncloud and then run your servers in those\nnetworks\nthe next one is s3 which is simple\nstorage service\nso s3 gives you the opportunity to\nupload and share files so it is mostly a\nfile storage and sharing service\nthen you've got rds which is relational\ndatabase service\nso this rds allows you to run and manage\ndatabases on the cloud so they've got\nalmost all the major flavors of\ndatabases right from sql server to\noracle and mysql postgresql\nthey have recently launched another one\nwhich is called aurora which claims to\nbe a very high performance database then\nroute 53 is there for dns\nso they've got a managed dns service\nwherein you can point your dns to amazon\nand they take care of the stuff\nso it's a global dns service it's a\nscalable dns service so it scales\naccording to demand\nthere's also elastic load balancer the\nelb is a service which gives you the\nopportunity to load balance incoming\ntraffic to multiple machines so this way\nyou can skill up your web applications\nto any number of users\nyou've got auto scaling which adds\ncapacity on the fly to elastic load\nbalancers so that your website or your\napplication is never down due to a load\nhow much does it cost this per our\nbilling is already mentioned for\neverything if it's something like a\nstorage thing again there's a per hour\nor per gb month storage\nso i think there is region specific\npricing so virginia is the cheapest\nregion out of all of them\nso the region's specific pricing is\nbecause they have got some regions which\nthey have got good hold of and they are\nthe headquarters so oregon and virginia\nare the cheapest actually\nthey also give you services based on the\nterm so if you sign up for something for\na year it would be cheaper for you\nrather than signing up for something on\nan on-demand basis so they've got\nreserved instances which are very cheap\nas compared to the on-demand ones you\ncan get discounts from twenty percent to\nalmost sixty percent if you sign up for\na three-year term\nthey are spot resources examples of\nthese are spot instances\nso this is like a bidding market base\nwhere you can bid for a price\nthe only downside of this kind of\npricing is that your machine might be\nterminated or your resources might be\nterminated if someone bids higher\npeople use these kind of things for\ndoing some ad hoc in search or some ad\nhoc tasks which are really not critical\nhow big is it\nthey have got 15 regions across major\ncountries of the world\nthey've got regions in the us europe\nasia pacific\nthey've got a global footprint so in\ntoday's world if you are anywhere in the\nworld you would have a region within 1\n000 miles of your location they've got\nmassive data centers so each of the\nregion has got multiple availability\nzones so one availability zone can be\nthought of as a big data center\nthe data centers have anywhere from\nthree hundred thousand to five hundred\nthousand servers\nwhat is the future of aws\nso they currently have 64 services which\nspan across infrastructural service\nsoftware as a service platform as a\nservice\nthey are launching new services in all\ndemands every day\nright now they are focusing on machine\nlearning\nso recently they've launched a couple of\nservices which focus exclusively on\nmachine learning and they are focusing\non software as a service product wherein\nthey want to take control of the service\nyou want to utilize\nthey don't want you to do it they want\nyou to upload it to them\nand every now and then they keep on\nreducing the costs so you would hear it\nin the blog that okay the price of ec2\nmachines has been reduced\nand this is because of their scale so\nthey scale up and they give the cost\nbenefit to the customer\nthat's all for today guys with just a\nquick intro of the amazon web services\ncloud\nhey want to become an expert in cloud\ncomputing then subscribe to simply\nlearn's channel and click here to watch\nmore such videos turn it up and get\ncertified in cloud computing click here\n",
