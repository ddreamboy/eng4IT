  "text": "hi and welcome to biostat squid the\ntopic of this video is principal\ncomponent analysis and how to use it to\ninterpret biological data let's Dive In\nso imagine you want to study aging and\nyou want to find out what factors\ncontribute to a longer or shorter\nlifespan\nstart with a data set that looks like\nthis let's say you have data from 20\npeople and the age when they passed away\nand we have many factors like their\nheight weight sex if they smoked or not\nabout their diets anyway we have 200\nfactors\nso in order to understand the data we\nneed to visualize it first but we cannot\nvisualize so many dimensions all at once\nwe could for example pick two factors\nand plot them for example we might think\nsmoking and cholesterol levels in blood\nmight be high contributors to your life\nexpectancy\nbut we're losing some possible valuable\ninformation contained in other factors\nof the data such as weight or Diet\nis there a way of taking into account\nall factors\nan amazing solution is principal\ncomponent analysis or PCA for short\nCA takes all of the factors combines\nthem in a smart way and produces new\nfactors these new factors are called\nprincipal components\nand it does that in such a way that if\nyou focus on just the first few\ncomponents you will keep most of the\ninformation from the data set\ngoing back to our example imagine we\ncomputed principal components analysis\non our data set and reduced our 200\nDimensions to five principal components\nthis is amazing we were able to simplify\nthe data much more and what's important\nwe didn't lose much information\nokay but we cannot represent five\ndimensions in a 2d plot the nice thing\nabout PCA is that principal components\nare ranked from most important to least\nimportant so let's just plot pc1 and PC2\nthis is our PCA plot and each point is a\nperson from our data set\nwhat if we colored the points by age\nwe can see that our samples already\nclustered together really nicely by age\nthose people who live longer seem to be\ngrouped together those who live shorter\ntend to be grouped together\nso PCA took into account all our\nbiological factors transformed them into\na new variables called principal\ncomponents and if we just take the first\ntwo we actually already see some\ninteresting Trends in our data\nbut what about the other PCS how do we\nknow if the first two principal\ncomponents are enough to capture most of\nthe information or variance in the data\nset\nwell the solution to this is a screen\nplot screen plot tells you how much\nvariance of the data set basically how\nmuch information is explained with each\nprincipal component in this case the\nfirst principal component explains 50\npercent of the variance in our data set\nThis Is Amazing by the way with actual\nreal life data sets if you get close to\n40 percent you might as well throw a\nparty anyways what this says is that 50\nof the variation of a person's lifespan\ncan be explained by principal component\n1. if you add principal component 2\nthat's another 35 percent which makes 85\npercent of course it depends on your\nobjectives but explaining 85 percent of\nvariance in life expectancy sounds quite\nnice to me ideally we want to get around\n90 variance with just two to three\ncomponents so that enough information is\nretained while we can still visualize\nour data um on a plot okay but what is\nexactly principle component One what\ndoes it mean as a biologist who's\ninterpreting biological data you are\ninterested in knowing which variables or\nbiological factors are responsible for\nthe patterns you see among the\nobservations or the people\nwe would like to know which variables\nare influential and also how the\nvariables are correlated this is given\nby the principal component loadings\nbasically each variable gets a loading\nor weight for each principal component\nwhich tells you how much it contributes\nto that PC\nwe can also plot the loadings to see the\nrelationship between our 200 variables\nlet's just plot some of them\nfor example for pc1 which again is the\nmost important PC we might expect to see\nvariables like greasy diet obesity heart\nrate or frequent exercise to have really\nlarge weights because they contribute a\nlot and maybe variables like how many\ntimes you brush your teeth a day have a\nlower weight so each of our 200\nvariables gets a loading score or weight\nfor each principal component\nyou might have noticed that variables\ncontributing similar information are\ngrouped together\nthis is part of the magic of PCA\nvariables that are positively correlated\nfor example greasy diets obesity are\ngrouped together\ncorrelated just means that when the\nnumerical variable of 1 increases or\ndecreases the numerical value of the\nother variable has a tendency to change\nin the same way\non the other hand when variables are\nnegatively or inversely correlated they\nare positioned on opposite sides of the\nplot origin in diagonally opposed\nquadrants for example your resting heart\nrate and height are inversely correlated\nmeaning that taller people tend to have\nlower resting rates compared to Shorter\npeople\nmoreover the distance to the origin also\ngives you information the further away a\nvariable is from the origin the stronger\nthe impact it has on the model for\nexample here obesity blood pressure and\naverage heart rate seem to be good\nvariables to separate longer lifespans\nfrom shorter life spans\nso this loading plot is a great way of\nseeing the relationship between our 200\nvariables at the same time it lets you\nknow what variables are influential and\nalso how the variables are correlated\nokay so back to our PCA plot how do we\nuse this to draw conclusions from our\ndata set\nlet's have a look at this other example\nwe have data from the gene expression\nprofile of 50 different patients with\nlung cancer and for each patient we\nmeasured the expression of 30 000 genes\nwe could plot the expression of genes\nindividually across all patients but we\ncannot visualize the expression of all\ngenes across all patients all at once or\ncan we to get a general overview of our\ndata a good place to start is with PCA\nso this is our PCA each point is one of\nour patients patients with similar gene\nexpression profiles are now clustered\ntogether just glancing at this plot we\ncan see that there are three clusters of\npatients\nthis means that overall we have three\ndistinct gene expression profiles and\nthis is very interesting because it\nmight mean that this group of patients\nwill respond better to drug X and this\nother group of patients will respond\nbetter to radiotherapy\nnow the orange and green clusters are\ndifferent based on pc1\nso the differences in gene expression\nprofiles are probably due to genes that\nhave heavy influences on pc1 remember\nthat the loadings tell us which genes\nhave heavier weights on the principal\ncomponent\nthe pink and green clusters are\ndifferent based on principle component\n2. so the genes that influence PC2 are\nmore likely to be responsible for this\nbut remember principal components are\nactually ranked by how much they\ndescribe the data pc1 is more important\nthan PC2 so actually differences between\nclusters along pc1 axis are larger than\nthe similar looking distances along PC2\naxis so here clusters green and orange\nare more different amongst each other\nthan clusters green and pink\nwait but there are two principal\ncomponents enough to represent all our\n30 000 genes\nperhaps you remember how to check this\nthat's right we need to take a look at\nthe screen plot in this case the first\ntwo principal components cover most of\nthe variation in our data set so they're\ngood enough\nand this is one of the first steps of\nanalysis as you can see PCA is a great\nway of representing large data sets to\nobserve Trends jumps clusters and\noutliers from here we would of course\nTrace back to find out which genes make\nthe Clusters different from one another\nso to sum up PCA is a great way of\nsummarizing large data sets with many\ndimensions into less Dimensions while\nretaining as much information as\npossible\nit captures the essence of the data into\na few principal components\nusually it's enough to keep just the\nfirst two or three principal components\nif they explain enough percent of the\ndata set\nto check how much variance or\ninformation the first few principal\ncomponents hold you should look at a\nscreen plot how do we read a BCA\nobservations with similar overall\nprofiles are clustered together pc1\ncaptures the most information from our\ndata set followed by PC2 and then PC3\nand so on this means that clusters\nseparated along the x-axis are more\ndifferent than clusters separated along\nthe y-axis by a similar distance\nif you're interested in understanding\nhow PCA actually works so how it is able\nto understand and summarize the data\nleave me a comment down below I will try\nmy best to explain it with zero math so\nyou can get an idea of how it does it\nif you like this video let me know and\nif you don't want to miss another video\nfrom biostat squid don't forget to\nsubscribe and that is all
