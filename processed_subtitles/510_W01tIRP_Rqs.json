  "text": "Supervised and unsupervised learning are two core components in building machine learning models.  \nSo what's the difference?\nWell, just to cut to the chase:\nsupervised learning, that uses labeled input \nand output data,\nwhile an unsupervised learning model doesn't.\nBut what does that really mean?\nWell, let's better define both learning models,\ngo deeper into the differences between them\nand then answer the question of which is best for you.\nNow, in supervised learning, the machine learning algorithm is  trained on a labeled dataset.\nSo this means that each example in the training dataset, the algorithm knows what the correct output is.\nAnd the algorithm uses this knowledge to try to generalize to new examples that it's never seen before.\nNow, using labeled inputs and outputs, the model can measure its accuracy and learn over time.\nSupervised learning can be actually divided into a couple of subcategories.\nFirstly, there is a category of classification.\nAnd classification talks about whether the output is a discrete class label\nsuch as \"spam\" and \"not spam\".\nLinear classifiers, support vector machines, or SPMs, decision trees, random forests -\nthey're all common examples of classification algorithms.\nThe other example is regression.\nThe output here is a continuous value, such as price or probability.  \nLinear regression and logistic regression are two common types of regression algorithms. \n  \nNow, unsupervised learning is where the machine learning algorithm is not really given any labels  at all.\nAnd these algorithms discover hidden patterns in data without the need for human intervention.\nThey're unsupervised.\nUnsupervised learning models are used for three main tasks, such as clustering, association and dimensionality reduction.\nSo let's take a look at each one of those, starting with clustering.\nNow clustering is where the algorithm groups similar experiences together.\nSo a common application of clustering is customer segmentation,\nwhere businesses might group customers together based on similarities like,\nI don't know, age or location or spending habits, something like that.\nThen you have association.\nAnd association is where the algorithm looks for relationships between variables in the data.  \nNow association rules are often used in market basket analysis,\nwhere businesses want to know  which items are often bought together.\nYou know, something along the lines of, \"customers who bought  this item also bought \",  that sort of thing.\nThe final one to talk about is dimensional ...\ndimensional reduction.\nAnd this is where the algorithm reduces the number of variables in the data,\nwhile still preserving as much of the information as possible.\nNow, often this technique is used in the pre-processing data stage,\nsuch as when autoencoders remove noise from visual images to improve picture quality.\nOkay, so let's talk about the differences between these two types of learning.\nIn supervised learning, the algorithm learns from training datasets by iteratively making predictions on the data\nand then adjusting for the correct answer.\nWhile supervised learning models tend to be more accurate than unsupervised learning models,\nthey do require all of this up-front human intervention to label the data appropriately.\nFor example, a supervised learning model can predict how long your commute will be\non the time of day and thinking about the weather conditions and so forth.  \nBut first you'll have to train it to know things like rainy weather extends the driving time. \n  \nBy contrast, unsupervised learning models work on their own to discover the inherent structure of unlabeled data.\nThese models don't need humans to intervene.\nThey can automatically find patterns in data and group them together.\nSo, for example, an unsupervised learning model can cluster images by the objects they contain\n- things like people and animals and buildings -\nwithout being told what those objects were ahead of time.\nNow, an important distinction to make is that unsupervised learning models don't make predictions.\nThey only group data together.\nSo if you were to use an unsupervised learning model on that same commute dataset,\nit would group together commutes with similar conditions \nlike the time of day and the weather,\nbut it wouldn't be able to predict how long each commute would take.\nOkay, so which of these two  options is right for you?\nIn general, supervised learning is more commonly used than unsupervised learning,\nand that's really because it's more accurate and efficient.\nBut that being said, unsupervised learning has its own advantages. There's two that I can think of.\nFirstly, unsupervised learning can be used on data that is not labeled,\nwhich is often the case in real world datasets.\nAnd then secondly, unsupervised learning can be used to find hidden patterns in data that supervised learning models just wouldn't find.\nClassifying big data can be a real challenge in supervised learning, but the results are highly accurate and trustworthy.\nAnd in contrast, unsupervised learning can handle large volumes of data in real time.\nBut there's a lack of transparency into how that data is clustered and a high risk given accurate results.\nBut wait, it is not an \"either/or\" choice.\nMay I present to you the middle ground known as semi-supervised learning.\nThis is, well, a happy medium where you use a training data set with both labeled and unlabeled data.\nAnd it's particularly useful when it's difficult to extract relevant features from data when you have a high volume of data.\nSo, for example, you could use a semi-supervised learning algorithm on a data set with millions of images\nwhere only a few thousand of those images are actually labeled.\nSemi-supervised learning is ideal for medical images, where a small amount of training data could lead to a significant improvement in accuracy.\nFor example, a radiologist can look at and label some small subset of CT scans for tumors or diseases,\nand then the machine can more accurately predict which patients might require more medical attention\nwithout going through and labeling the entire set.\nMachine learning models are a powerful way to gain the data insights that improve our world.\nThe right model for your data depends on the type of data that you have and what you want to do with it.\nAnd the choice between supervised and unsupervised learning is only the first step.\nIf you have any questions, please drop us a line below.\nAnd if you want to see more videos like this in the future, please like and subscribe.\nThanks for watching!\n",
