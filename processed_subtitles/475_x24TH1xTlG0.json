  "text": "[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\neverybody welcome back to Jimmy's promo\nand today I'm going to share with you\nguys how you're able to create your own\npersonal cloud storage at home so right\nnow what I'm using is the Western\nDigital My Cloud home personal cloud\nmine is four terabytes in terms of\nstorage but there is a bunch of\ndifferent sizes you can choose there's\ntwo terabyte six terabyte eight terabyte\n12 16 and 20 terabyte now I have this\none set up with basically every\nsmartphone that I've ever had in the\nlast couple years as well as my wife's\nand also all the tablets and if you\nwanted to you can still plug in your\ncomputer and laptop now I mostly just\nuse it for all of our smartphones\nbecause we have multiples of those and\nif you wanted to yes you can back up\nyour computers or you'd be able to add\nin videos documents pictures things like\nthat from your computer so this way it\nis on that cloud that you're able to\naccess from your smartphone so first\nwhat I want to do is show you what the\napplication will look like then I'm\ngoing to show you what this looks like\non amazon.com so you can take a look at\nthe product itself which I will be\nlinking below the video inside\ndescription and then we'll head over\ninto the website version of this\napplication so you can see what that\nuser interface looks like as well so\nfirst off the benefit of having your own\npersonal cloud at home is the fact that\nyou don't have to pay those monthly and\nyearly fees you purchase the unit one\ntime and that is it it sits at your home\nfor many years to come so first let's\ntake a look at the application the first\ntab on the very top is going to be files\nand folders so for files and folders\nyou're able to create and set these ones\nup I do have a bunch of backups for some\nof my smartphones that I have I have\nlike a YouTube folder that I uploaded a\nfew videos from the computer itself so\nthis way I can access it here on my\nphone if you go inside of here this is\nall of the pictures that you have it's\ngoing to show you everything that you've\ntaken for you know per month for every\nsingle year so now we're in October of\n2022 here is September of 2022 and then\nthis last tab on the very top is your\nalbums tab so this way you can be more\norganized you can categorize things put\nthem in albums you can also share albums\nwith other people you can see this one\nhere this one was for the wife and I\nshared it with her because she also has\nher phone set up as well the cool thing\nabout it is that every user that you\nhave set up with this cloud storage you\ncan't see anybody else's data so\neverything that I have backed up my wife\nis not able to see and everything that\nthe wife has I'm not able to see\nanything except for if she wants to\nshare anything with me now going back to\nthe second tab because this is the one\nthat's pretty important it's going to\nshow you all of the images that you have\nagain all of the smartphones that you\nhave all of your tablets you have\neverything back up you can turn on auto\nbackup or you can have it off and you\ncan select things manually so right here\nyou can take a look at everything in\nterms of everything or you can only take\na look at photos or if you only want to\nsearch through your videos the next\nthing is you can change how it looks so\nby tapping that next tab if you want\nyour images to look a little bit\ndifferent you know if you take them in\nhorizontal or vertical and then this\nright here is going to be able to break\ndown the month and the year so if you\nknow for a fact that there is something\nthat you took back in 22 you are back in\n2020 that you want to take a look at\nmaybe there's some images back in 2021\nyou want to take a look at so here is\nSeptember of 2021 that's loading so I'd\nbe able to take a look at everything I\ndid if there's something particular that\nI'm taking a look at so maybe this is a\npicture that's very very important when\nyou tap on it you can share the image\nyou can add it to an album you can save\nthis one to your mobile device so maybe\nyou have a brand new phone maybe this is\nyour favorite photo you can save it to\nyour device and then inside of more you\ncan do all of that plus take a look at\nall of the info you can see you know who\nhas access to it which is only me you\ncan see what phone took the picture when\nit was uploaded things like that and\nthen the other thing that you also have\nis going to be this little check mark so\nthis is kind of a organize and and\nchoose files so if there are particular\nthings that you want to add into a\nfolder maybe there's things that you\nwant to share or you want to do a mass\ndelete you hit on that delete button and\nthen you're able to get rid of those\nthings organize stuff like that if you\nwant to go right back to where we were\nwhich is November of 2022 this is where\nwe're sitting so now let's take a look\nat the application that you want to\ndownload for this to work so you just\nwant to go inside of your Play Store or\nApp Store you want to search for my\ncloud home it's a free application it's\nmade by Western Digital you just want to\nget it downloaded and installed and you\njust set everything up now the setup\nprocess of this is super super simple I\nmean really it's just a power cord as\nwell as the landline plugged in you also\nhave a USB in the back so this way if\nyou wanted to plug in a flash drive or\nwhatever and you wanted to add stuff in\nthat way you're able to do that as well\nnow on the top left hand side this is\nwhere you can see a bunch of things you\ncan import photos manually if you wanted\nto you can do more which just means\nyou're able to learn other things and\nthen you can also copy a USB there's a\nbunch of other images that is being able\nto be backed up right now so there's 374\nleft these are just screenshots this is\na new backup folder that I just selected\nso this way you'd be able to see that\nsomething is going to back up if you go\ninside of the settings this is where you\ngo through the settings you can set up a\npasscode so this way because it is an\napplication on your phone if people are\nlooking at your phone and you don't want\nthem to go through your Cloud just set\nup a passcode and then you can set up\nyour fingerprint now inside of here\nwe're going to tap on my cloud home so\nwith inside of the My Cloud home this is\ngoing to show you the users as well as\nhow much space is available so you can\nsee that we have a four terabyte of\nstorage and the space available is 3.45\nbut we have two users we have myself as\nwell as my wife now taking a look at the\ntwo users you can see that I have used\nabout 4.1 percent of the four terabytes\nthe wife has used 5.7 percent of the\nfour terabytes so I've only used 157\ngigs she has used 220 gigs so it's\nreally fun that you can have all of\nthese different users but never be able\nto see what they are uploading and so\nthat just makes it very private for\nyourself because again this is your\npersonal cloud I just happen to have\nthis unit sitting at home that I can add\nmultiple users where everybody can back\nup now through here you can also reboot\nas well as do erase all data now on the\nrest of this settings page you can see\nthe auto backups right now we have it\nturned on if I wanted to I can actually\nturn off the auto backup and then I can\ndo things manually now when you turn on\nthe auto backup this is where you can\nselect what you would like to back up so\nright now DCIM this is pretty much all\nof my images that I take with the camera\nnow any of those images that maybe you\nsave from Facebook is right here maybe\nif you have a folder that you\nspecifically created on your phone\ncalled Florida then you'd be able to do\nthat Halo package one so these are just\ndifferent folders that I personally\ncreated on my device you also have\nscreenshots and that's actually the one\nthat I just selected to show you what it\nlooked like if ones were updating or\nuploading so I'm just going to turn\nthose off because I don't really need\nscreenshots they're not as important if\nthere are screenshots that I need to\nhave I can just manually input them but\nhere you can scroll through and you can\nsee what you're able to automatically up\nupdate or a backup onto your storage\ndevice and you can either do it on Wi-Fi\nwhich that is the original normal setup\nbut if you want to do it with the\ncellular backup you can actually turn on\ncellular backups this way you're always\nbacking up all of your photos all of\nyour videos all of the time so even if\nor I should say even when your storage\ncloud is sitting at home which is where\nit's going to be you'd be able to be out\nand about in a completely different city\nstate country as long as you have that\nyou as long as you have cellular\nanything that you have taken photos of\nit'll be able to automatically back up\nso you don't have to be at home for your\nmachine at home to have it all back up\nso that's everything I wanted to show\nyou with the application side of things\nyou can take a look and specifically\nlook for photos specifically look for\nvideos you'll be able to change the way\nit looks as well as take a look at\nsomething from a few months ago or even\na few years ago here's the three little\ntabs you have your files and folders\nhere's all the photos and stuff here's\nalbums you can create to organize\neverything the very top left hand side\nwe already took a look at all of the\nsettings that you need to take a look at\nand that's pretty much really about it\nso here we are on the Amazon page this\nis the Western Digital four terabyte my\ncloud home personal cloud mine is a\nsingle Drive White if you wanted to and\nget more storage and go with the duo\nDrive they have four six eight 12 16 and\n20 terabyte but again I have that single\nDrive the four terabyte was fine for us\nagain we're not even close to even\nfilling this thing up I don't even think\nwe're at 10 just yet and so with this\none for single you can go for two four\nsix and eight uh the price is very very\ngreat when you think about the fact that\nyou don't have to pay month monthly fees\nor anything like that like all the other\ncloud services and this is just one\nsitting at home you can just fully\ncustomize everything as you've seen take\na look at it all so it has really good\nreviews I love this thing I wouldn't be\nshooting a video if I wouldn't want to\nsuggest it so because I do suggest it\nI'm just going to share with you guys\nthat's what I've been doing for the last\ncouple years so I will be placing this\nlink below the video inside of the\ndescription now we're going to take a\nlook at the website version so really\nit's the same UI all you have to do is\njust go to\nhome.mycloud.com and you just go through\nand you sign in now once you sign in\nthis is the user interface right here on\nyour computer so here's your files and\nfolders as you scroll on down you know\nyou can take a look at any of these\nthings that you have created I have\nmusic in there a couple videos in there\nhere's that shared uh folder right here\nof girls night here is a drawing so this\nwas something that I have edited created\non the computer but I put it in this\nfolder so I can access it on my phone\nlet's take a look at all the photos so\nthis is everything that you just got\ndone seeing on the phone application\nversion and here's all of the photos\nhere's just only the videos if that's\nwhat you would like to go for and then\nyou also have your date and time so if\nyou wanted to go through find something\nspecific you'd be able to do that you\ncan also do a search and that's really\nwhere it comes in handy if you wanted to\ngo inside of here and then you want to\nadd in descriptions so albums exactly\nwhat we saw on the phone as well shared\nif you would like to share something or\nif or let's say if someone shared\nsomething with me so if the wife created\na album and she shared it with me this\nis where I'd be able to see it on her\nend of things when she goes to shared\nthat is where she's able to find her\ngirls night out if we go inside of the\nsettings so inside of the settings\npretty much looking like the uh the\napplications you have your first name\nlast name email you can also change the\nemail reset the password as well as sign\nout you can also add a user same thing\non the application and when you go\ninside of the Jimmy's my cloud home this\nis where you'd be able to take a look at\nthe details of the uh the hard drive\nitself so here you can see that the\nconnection type here is local we've only\nused a little bit of the storage so our\nspace available is 3.4 or 5 terabyte\nstill free so we've only used\n0.55 terabyte which is not a lot at all\nwhen you can when you consider all of\nthe smartphones that we have at home as\nwell as the tablets this is where you\ncan change the name of your unit if you\nwanted to uh here you can have the\nanalytics on or off then you also have\nthe users area so this way if you wanted\nto add more users I feel like I will be\nadding in my sun at some point he's a\nlittle too young right now even though\nhe has a smartphone every day but all of\nhis random photos doesn't need to be on\nhere when he gets a bit older everything\nis much much more important to them\nwe'll be able to add him in as a user as\nwell this is where you can manage the\ndevice device logs reboot the device\nshut it down erase all data and then you\ncan also detach from the device itself\nso that's pretty much it for this unit\nhere this is everything I wanted to show\noff I showed you the Amazon page if you\nwant to take a look at it and purchase\nit showed you what it looked like on the\nwebsite as well as what it looks like on\nyour phone as a as an application so if\nyou have a bunch of smartphones if you\nhave a bunch of tablets your tired of\npaying all of those monthly fees of of\nyou know the Google backup or Samsung\nbackup whatever it may be any of those\ncloud services if you're just tired of\npaying those fees you might as well buy\nthe unit one time and have it for many\nmany years getting everything all backed\nup again you can always go back in time\nselect an image you'll be able to\ndownload it to your device and that's\npretty much what's the most important\nand really you always just want to go\nback to it if you want to take a look at\nit and if you ever want to add in more\nstorage all you'd have to do is buy\nanother unit you can add it to it so\nthis way you have two of them plugged in\nor you'd be able to transfer everything\nfrom one to the other if you're getting\none that's much much bigger I just\nhighly suggest buying one more that's\nmaybe the same size so if you buy four\nterabyte today maybe in 10 years you\nmight need to buy another one then just\ngo through and purchase another personal\ncloud yourself but hopefully you guys\nappreciated this video If you guys did\nplease give it a big thumbs up don't\nforget to hit subscribe subscribe on the\nvery bottom left hand side and if you\nlike this video then more than likely\nyou'll also like this video and I'll see\nyou guys later\n[Music]\n",
