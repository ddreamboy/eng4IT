  "text": "so if you're on coding YouTube a lot\nyou're going to see a lot of videos that\nhave the title how I'd learn to code if\nI could do it all over again personally\nI think that there's a lot of BS in\nthese videos and I think that for a lot\nof viewers you don't know what to do so\ntoday we're going to talk about how I\nwould learn how to do web development in\n2023 if I were just starting out it's a\nno BS way to do it though who am I my\nname is Dylan I taught myself how to\ncode during the pandemic and I currently\nwork full-time as a programmer at a\nsoftware startup on my channel I share\nall the lessons that I learned on my\njourney so if you're new kick back enjoy\nthe ride let's jump in and if you really\nlike the stuff make sure to hit that\nsubscribe button I'm going to give a\nquick PSA here learning web development\nlearning software engineering learning\nhow to code does not take 3 months\nyou're going to see a lot of videos on\nYouTube telling you that you can become\na Google software engineer in 3 months\nand make half a million dollars a year\nthat's not real I wouldn't believe it\ncoding is a lifelong learning process it\ntakes years to master I'm only a few\nyears in and I still consider my myself\nto be an amateur the second thing don't\ndo Harvard cs50 I'm not saying that it's\na bad course but a lot of people are\ngoing to steer you in the direction of\ntaking this type of course and\npersonally I don't think that it's\nneeded I think that by taking a course\nlike Harvard cs50 you're further just\nkicking the can down the road if I were\nstarting on day one I would hop on free\ncode Camp I would start learning HTML\nand CSS in the basic web design course\nthat free c-amp offers that's what I did\nthat's how I learned it it only took me\n3 weeks to learn mind you I was really\nputting the hours in every day so that's\nwhy I got through it in 3 to 4 weeks so\nI think if you're committed you can do\nit in less than a month once you've\ncompleted the web design track on free\nCamp I would go on to udemy or something\nsimilar and take a JavaScript course and\nlearn the basics if I were doing it all\nover again I wouldn't try to become a\nJavaScript Master understand what a\nJavaScript function does before you list\nthat you're a web developer on your\nresume like can you type out a function\nin the console like this is a super\nbasic concept that you should know how\nto do this is basic JavaScript once you\nfinish a basic JavaScript and web\ndevelopment course on you to me I would\nbuild a project that you're interested\nin like ask yourself what are your\ninterests what are your passions what do\nyou like don't build a Netflix clone\neverybody does that don't build a meta\nclone everybody does that like you\nshould be original do something that is\nunique and something that you're\npassionate about not what everybody else\nwants you to do in advantage of this\napproach is that when you're actually\nbuilding the thing you're more likely to\nenjoy what it is that you're working\nworking on because you like the stuff\nthat you're working on it's something\nthat you're actually passionate about so\nfor me I'm super interested in career\ndevelopment so I built a job board in\nvanilla JavaScript and I really like\ndoing that because I'm super interested\nin what it is that I was building make\nsure that you do it in the language\nstripped of any Frameworks this is\nimportant because it reinforces the\nfundamental Basics and understanding of\nthe language of your choice like you\nwant to know the basics like how to\nwrite a function how to write a for Loop\nin JavaScript it's only until after\nyou've built this project in the vanilla\nlanguage of your choice that you can\nbuild it in a framework so after I was\ndone building this project in vanilla\nJavaScript I then decided to rebuild the\nproject in the framework of my choice\nwhich was react I was able to better\nunderstand react as a result because\nlike I really understood the basics of\nJavaScript this is super important\nbecause a lot of people are going to\ntell you that you should immediately\nstart building in the framework of your\nchoice taking a quick pause here this\nvideo is not about getting a job I made\na lot of other videos about that which\nI'll link up here but I wanted to say\nlike in my opinion I don't think that\nyou need to go to a boot camp and I\ndon't think that you need to go back to\nschool and get a CS degree the main\nadvantage of these two options is\nhonestly just the structure that is\nprovided and you could also argue\nprobably the community too but all the\nmaterial that is offered it's all free\nand cheap on the internet and like if\nyou want Community just go to a Meetup\nthey're completely free and Meetup\norganizers want as many people there as\npossible let's say you have a bug in\nyour code like go to a Meetup and ask\npeople I bet that you can figure it out\nat that Meetup rather than paying a boot\ncamp\n$177,000 for them to listen to your\nproblems for you a small rant there's so\nmany options like there's so much out\nthere and there's so many people trying\nto push you in the direction of paying\nthem money so they can convince you that\nyou can get a job in like 3 months like\nyou might be able to by doing one of\nthese programs but it's highly unlikely\nlike you have to put the work in so my\nmessage is this just Google it like\nyou're going to have to Google it and go\non one stack Overflow whether you're in\na boot camp or doing a CS degree anyways\nso like you might as well just get\nreally good at being resourceful\nyourself and like I said go to meetups\nfor collaboration like if you have a bug\nor something go to a Meetup and I'm sure\nyou guys are going to be able to figure\nit out you can also use other resources\nlike YouTube YouTube is amazing stack\nOverflow is great too and as I mentioned\nat the beginning of the video like\nthere's no hacking your brain that's all\na bunch of clickbait BS like you can't\nhack your brain to learn how to code\nit's a brain it's a muscle I think it's\na muscle like you have to just Google\neverything you have to learn to be\nresourceful learn how to struggle and\nlearn how to learn it's not about the\nactual coding language or web\ndevelopment technology itself it's\nlearning how to learn the actual Tech so\nin summary if I were just starting out I\nwould hop on free camp and do the web\ndesign course it's totally free and\nyou'll learn HTML and CSS if you put in\nthe work every single day you'll\nprobably be able to get through it in 3\nto 4 weeks then I would hop on you to me\nand take a JavaScript Focus course or\nsomething that's a little more\ncomprehensive in web development I'll\nlink a couple of the example courses in\nthe description and focus on just\ngetting good at the basics of vanilla\nJavaScript and then take all those\nskills that you just learned from the\nlast couple of courses and build a\nProject based on something that you're\npassionate about don't build a Netflix\nclone everybody does that you want to be\noriginal and also the advantage of doing\nsomething that you're interested in is\nthat you're more likely to keep doing it\nbecause you're interested in doing it\nthen when you're done building that\nproject in vanilla JavaScript you can\nrebuild it in the framework of your\nchoice and lastly you have to learn how\nto struggle you have to learn how to\nlearn go and Google it like there's no\nbrain hacks to this stuff you can't hack\nyour brain and become more productive\nand learn how to code this is stuff that\npeople try to sell you on the internet\nlike it's a brain come on you can't hack\nit it's not a computer learn how to\nstruggle and how to gird through\nproblems the real way the way that\neverybody else does it so don't buy into\nthe BS anyways that is how I would learn\nhow to do web development in 2023 if I\nwere just starting out again this is my\nbold take this is what I see on YouTube\nand what I disagree and agree with so if\nyou like this content give this video a\nlike so we can push out to more people\nand hopefully motivate and Inspire\nothers I make a lot of other videos like\nthis so feel free to check another one\nout I appreciate any support on my\nchannel comment below let me know what\nyou think until next time peace\n",
