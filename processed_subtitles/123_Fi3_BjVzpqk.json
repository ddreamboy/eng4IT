  "text": "meet Adam an aspiring entrepreneur he is\ninterested in hosting an online store\nfor home decor products like bases\ncurtains artwork and Home Furnishings he\nrequires a software application that\nwould allow the customers to browse the\navailable products at their fingertips\nand buy them online\nAdam eager to jump into his new business\nwanted to understand how the software\ndevelopment process works to start with\nhis business idea Adam meets his cousin\nMark who is a software developer and a\ngood one at it he pitches his idea and\nasks his cousin to help him design an\nonline business application\nMark explains to Adam the way of\nDesigning the best online shopping\napplication we need to understand the\nworking of the software development\nlifecycle also known as the sdlc it\ninvolves distinctive phases to initiate\nthe software production based on the\nclient requirements\nfurther Mark briefs Adam about the six\ncrucial phases of sdlc in designing any\nsoftware application\nplanning requirements phase requirement\nanalysis phase designing phase\nimplementation phase testing phase\ndeployment and maintenance phase\nthe development team will commence\nproduction post agreeing on the terms\nand conditions discussed between the\nclient and the development team\nregarding all the proceedings and\nrequirements\ninitiating the production with the\nplanning requirements phase where the\nclient and the development team will\ndiscuss the basic requirements for the\nsoftware like the purpose of the\napplication the details about the end\nuser of the product key elements like\nformat and attributes of the application\nfor Designing and the overall user\ninterface's design of the software the\ndevelopment moves on to the second stage\nthe requirement analysis phase which\nincludes the detailed information about\neach element to design the software is\ndiscussed validating the installation of\nelements in the application according to\nthe client's requirements calibrating\nthe security protocols and Performing\nrisk analysis for the software\napplication and all the discussed\ndetails are then to be filed in the\nsoftware requirements specification\ndocument also known as the SRS document\nafter completing the second phase third\nstage of software development the design\nphase the software designers will devise\nthe system design following the SRS\ndocument the system design defines the\noverall architecture of the software and\nchecks its feasibility with the client's\nrequirements\nall the details of the design phase are\nadded to the design document\nspecification also known as the DDS\ndocument and shared with the analysts\nand stakeholders for review\nnext the development moves on to the\nfourth stage the coding or\nimplementation phase in the coding phase\nthe developers start writing the code\nusing the languages they choose for the\nsoftware development the coding stage is\nalso one of the most important phases as\nit encapsulates the implementation of\nthe software product\nthe developers use predefined guidelines\nand development tools like compilers and\ndebuggers to implement the code\nthe next phase of the production is\nwhere we begin with the fifth stage of\nsoftware development the testing phase\nthe develop software is now deployed in\nmultiple test environments to check the\nfunctioning of all the attributes in the\nsoftware architecture after the test\ncases are completed the quality\nassurance and the testing team may find\nerrors or bugs in the software which\nwill be forwarded to the developer team\nfor debugging this testing and debugging\nprocess continues until the software is\nstable and works per the required\nspecifications\nas for the last stage in the sdlc life\ncycle the deployment and maintenance\nphase is initiated\nwith the testing phase completed the\nsoftware application is ready for\ndeployment and consumer use\nin this phase the development team will\nset up links for the application and\nmake it accessible to the users after\nthe deployment is completed and users\nbegin using the application they may\nencounter an error or a bug in the\napplication which is to be solved from\ntime to time\nmaintenance also includes releasing\napplication updates and enhancements for\nthe software for better performance and\nuser experience\nAdam at this point was surprised by all\nthe effort and steps taken by the\ndevelopment team to design a software\napplication and the key phases involved\nin sdlc\nand on that note here's a question for\nyou all what does the design document\nspecification document include software\ncode details on defects and bugs\nsoftware architecture details software\nrequirements give it a thought and leave\nyour answers in the comments section\nbelow three lucky winners will receive\nAmazon gift vouchers\nwith Mark's explanation of the sdlc life\ncycle Adam understood how software is\ndeveloped now he can actively give\nfeedback to the development team and\ndesign the best software application for\nhis online store and maybe expand to\nother businesses as well we hope you\nfound this informative and helpful if\nyou've enjoyed this video a thumbs up\nwould really be appreciated\ndon't forget to subscribe to this simply\nlearn Channel and hit the Bell icon to\nnever
