  "text": "what is going on guys welcome to this\nvideo in today's episode we're going to\ntalk about natural language processing\nand we're going to build a script that\nanalyzes the sentiment of a text so\nwe're going to feed a text into our\nscript and the spirit is then going to\ntell us hey this is a slightly positive\ntext is a slightly negative text this is\na pretty neutral text this is a very\nnegative text or this is a very positive\ntext so we're going to use natural\nlanguage processing techniques but we're\nalso going to keep it a very high level\nso we're not going to get in depth into\nwhat is happening behind the scenes\nwe're going to just use some libraries\nand make it happen pretty quickly in\nPython so this is what we're going to do\nin this video so let us get into the\ncode alright so as always we're going to\nstart by installing some libraries so\nwe're going to say activate main which\nis my kana environment if you don't have\na condo environment just use pip\ndirectly but otherwise activate it and\ntype pip install and we're going to\ninstall three libraries one because it's\nthe basis for the other two and two\nbecause we're actually going to use them\nand the basis is called NLT Kay which\nstands for I think natural language\ntoolkit and it's the essential basic\nfundamental library for natural language\nprocessing in Python and it's also what\nthe other two libraries are using or\nbuild on so in addition to that we're\ngoing to install our text block which is\nwhat we're actually going to use for the\nsentiment analysis as you can see it's\nusing an LT King and also we're going to\nsay pip install newspaper 3k which is\nessentially the library that we're going\nto use to get newspaper articles into\nour script for sentiment analysis so\nthese are the three libraries that we're\ngoing to use or that we're going to\ninstall two of them were going to use\nand for the inputs we're going to save\nfrom text blob import text block with a\ncapital T capital B and then we're going\nto save from newspaper import article so\nthese are the two things that we're\ngoing to need and then we can start\nanalyzing some articles so the next step\nis to now go ahead and get the article\ninto the script in order to perform a\nsentiment analysis on to it so for this\nwe're going to specify the URL of the\narticle and for\nI thought I'm going to look up some\narticles here on Wikipedia because\nWikipedia should be pretty neutral when\nit talks about topics like for example\nmathematics which I'm going to look for\nright now this should have a pretty\nneutral score and in the end we're going\nto get a score from -1 to 1 where -1 is\nthe most negative thing there is like a\nhateful angry article and/or text and 1\nis the most positive thing a happy and\npositive article and 0 is like\ncompletely neutral so on Wikipedia we\nshould get probably more neutral\nexamples of texts here and on CNBC when\nwe get some news off the Dow Jones\nrising 100 points this should be a\npretty positive text a pretty positive\nsentiment whereas when we have news\nabout a recession will be much worse\nthan 2007 to 2009 this should be a\npretty negative article and we're going\nto check if this is what our program\noutputs in the end so we're going to\nstart by saying URL equals mathematics\nthe mathematics article in Wikipedia and\nthen we're going to transform and\ntransform it into an article object of\nthe newspaper library so we're going to\nsay article equals article URL and this\nis essentially the object that we're\ngoing to use to get the article into the\nscript so we're going to say article dot\ndownload to get it into the script\narticle dot parse to make it you know\nreadable or basically to get all the\nHTML out of it I think and then we're\ngoing to say article dot NLP which is\nessentially preparing it for natural\nlanguage processing and now what we're\ngoing to do is we're going to say text\nequals we want to get the text of the\narticle and for this we can either go\nfor the full text so we're going and we\ncan say article dot text which will\nessentially give us the whole text\nwithout the HTML text and all of that so\nit will essentially give us every piece\nof text that is contained on that\nwebsite I think or most of it so the\nfull article about mathematics as you\ncan see I don't know if this is the full\none but it's\na lot more information that you get then\nif you say some early for example\nbecause the summary is basically just\nfocusing on the main content of this\narticle and as you can see if we go for\nthe full text we see a lot of stuff that\nit's not really related to the text\nsomething like see also notes references\nand so on\nwhich are not really important for the\nsentiment analysis because they're\ncontained in every Wikipedia post so the\nsummary we can take a look at it is a\nlittle bit more focusing on what's\nactually written in the article the main\ninformation here so we're going to pick\nthe summary as the sentiment analysis\ndata set so to say and what we're going\nto do for that is we're going to create\nan a block object so we're going to say\nblob equals text blob text block capital\nT capital B of the text so we're going\nto pass the string here we're not\npassing the article object the article\nobject is just for getting the text just\ngetting the clean summary of the text\ninto the script and now we're going to\nget this text and create a text blob\nobject from it and then we're going to\nsay sentiment equals blob down sentiment\ndot polarity this is the one we're going\nto look at it's going to give us a score\nfrom minus 1 to 1 we're again minus 1 is\nvery negative 1 is very positive and we\ncan just go ahead and print the\nsentiment of this particular mathematics\narticle of Wikipedia and in this case\nit's a little bit positive as you can\nsee 0.13 is more to the 1 than to the\nminus 1\nso closer to the 1 basically and I think\nthis is probably because we're talking a\nlot about discovery and success in the\npast and what mathematicians found out\nand it's a little bit more to the\npositive side then to the negative side\nbecause mathematics is a pretty neutral\ntopic but still it yields a lot of\nprocess and a progress and achievement\nso probably this is the reason why this\nis a more positive text now let's go\nahead and pick the Dow Rises more than a\nhundred points and let's see if this is\nmore positive than the\npoint three one one three sorry I think\nit should definitely be positive well at\nleast more positive oh it's negative why\nis it Oh\nas you can see probably it's negative\nbecause of stuff like the S&P 500 is\ndown or okay gains I don't know why\nexactly probably because we have an\nalmost equal amount of negative and\npositive statements in here probably\nbecause we're talking a lot about\npandemics and and problems and I don't\nknow what but as you can see it's a\nslightly negative argument but as you\ncan see it is almost neutral so I was\nexpecting that to be more positive than\nnegative here to be honest but as you\ncan see this is not prepared or at least\nnot I'm not just picking stuff to show\nyou that what I prepared works but I'm\nactually working on some real articles\nhere so this one should be pretty\nnegative because it's all about\nrecession and worse and bad and it's\npositive what the is happening here\nlet's check why this is the case we have\na pretty neutral stuff here but actually\nwe're having some words like hitting the\nUS economy harder than a crisis\nrecession so I really don't know why\nthis is so positive here maybe I have to\nspectrum the other way around but let's\ncheck for another article here\nlet's talk CNBC I don't know losses or\nsomething European markets pair losses\nand focus on pandemic recovery so this\nshould be negative or at least more\nnegative than positive but let's see\nwhat the output says again it's a little\nbit more negative a little bit more\npositive sorry but most of them are pre\nneutral so let go let's go for some\nmurder news to see if we have some there\nyou go\nshooting murder investigation and I so\nthis should definitely be a negative\narticles let's see if this works better\nthan the rest\nlet's just replace the link here and see\nwhat happens all right this one is\nobviously negative because we have\ntraumatic and victim and wounds and I\ndon't know what dramatic again so and\nalso died and something like that so as\nyou can see it's not a hundred percent\nreliable but if a post is extremely\nnegative in one direction it's probably\ngoing to recognize it also if you have a\nvery very positive text it's going to\nrecognize it if it's more like a gray\nzone it's probably not going to\nrecognize things by just looking at the\nsummary maybe if you go for the\nheadlines specifically it's going to\ngive you better results because the\narticle about the recession was probably\ntalking a lot about hope and about\nstocks and money which is probably\nassociated more with positive values\nwhereas also the one that talked about\ngains in the markets talked about\npandemics and problems and diseases and\nall of that so it's probably the reason\nwhy we get some mixed scores or some\nneutral scores there but this is\nessentially how you analyze articles\nfrom the web and now we're going to take\na look at how to analyze our own text\nall right in order to analyze our own\ntext the only thing that we need to do\nis we need to replace all of this year\nall the article stuff here with some\ntext that we scan in from files or we\ncan actually write the text in Python\nitself but let's just create a new file\nhere let's say file equals my text dot\ntxt and we're going to write a review\nfor a product here I loved this product\nit was great I will definitely buy more\nof it excellent experience so this is a\nvery very positive post a very positive\nreview so let's see if our bluff object\nis going to recognize that so we're\ngoing to say with F with open sorry with\nopen my text dot txt in reading mode SF\nwe're going to say text equals F\ndot REIT and the rest is the same so\nlet's see if it works this should\ndefinitely work with a very high score\nas you can see we got a score off 0.7\nwhich is extremely high because it's\nextremely positive of course now let's\ntry the other way around and say\nsomething like I hate this thing it's\ndestroyed destroyed my life I would\nnever buy it again\nworst experience yet this is a bad\nproduct so if you have something very\nobvious it's going to recognize it so\nlet's try again and as you can see we\nget a almost negative 1 which is\nnegative zero point 9 3 which is almost\nnegative 1 so if it's that obvious it's\ngoing to give you the right answer if\nit's a mixed article you see that\nthere's some more gray area there and\nit's not as obvious for the natural\nlanguage processing kit used by text\nblob here but we can also try to you\nknow write a somewhat negative text that\nis still quite neutral to see what the\nresult would be for example yesterday I\nwent biking for let's go for hiking and\non the way up I heard my knees it was or\nit was not good which is probably a\nlittle bit confusing because good is\nrated as a good word as a positive word\nit was not good we did not have a lot of\nfun which is again misleading now I have\nsome wounds and I am bleeding I am also\na little bit sad\nfor you and we can say but all in all it\nwas a decent experience pretty confusing\ntexture but I think it will probably\neven be rated more positive than\nnegative\noh no I'm again wrong it's negative\nprobably because I used words like sad\nbleeding wounds and maybe it's even\ncapable of associating the knot with the\ngood so probably this is why it's a\nlittle bit more than a negative side\nbecause 0.13 on the negative side is you\nknow not that neutral anymore it's\nclearly negative here but if I replace\ndecent with a great experience probably\nit's going to be less negative here at\nleast I think so yeah now it's even more\npositive not not only even more positive\nbut it's actually positive more positive\nthan neutral so one word can change a\nlot here as you can see this library's\njust for a little bit for playing around\na little but if you want to make a solid\nsentiment analysis you're probably going\nto have some more sophisticated\nalgorithms in the back so we're going to\nfocus more on the headlines and more on\nspecific word combinations you're not\njust going to feed in the text into text\nblop and expect it to be a very accurate\nrepresentation of the sentiment here\nhowever if you're going to get I don't\nknow if you're going to scan a thousand\nAmazon reviews on a product and when I\nget the average is it more positive or\nmore negative it's probably going to\nwork because most Amazon reviews are\nquite clear they're telling you if it's\na good product it's a bad product and\nsomething in between\ncombined with the stars you're probably\ngoing to get a good feeling of how\npeople think about the product so this\nis something you could use this for also\nyou could perform some Twitter analysis\nwith it and you can base your stock\npredictions on it if you put a little\nbit more effort in building this tool\nyou can definitely use it for some\ninteresting stuff so that's it for\ntoday's video I hope you learned\nsomething and I hope you enjoyed it if\nthat was the case hit the like button\nand subscribe to his channel too so\nor it also feel free to ask questions\nand give feedback in the comments\nsection down below tell me if you want\nto see more videos on natural language\nprocessing or tell me what kind of\nvideos that you want to see in the\nfuture maybe I can do something about\nthem and yeah that's basically it so see\nyou in the next video thanks for\nwatching and bye\n[Music]\nyou\n",
