  "text": "all right good morning everybody and\nwelcome to today's training so today's\ntraining we are going to be talking\nabout the nist CSF 2.0 framework so this\nis something that has been very very hot\noff the press the last few weeks it was\nreleased towards the end of February by\nnist and everybody's been talking about\nit and I've had several of you ask me\nquestions about this so that's why I\ndecided to put a training together to\nreally do a deep dive of Nest CSF 2.0\nand more importantly for you guys as um\nall part of my it audit training program\nI want you to Al also understand the\nimplications for your it audit or it\ncompliance career so let me go ahead and\nget started with the training so today's\ntraining like I said is the ncsf 2.0 and\nwe're going to be understanding the\nframework so let's take a look at the\ntopics that we have for\ntoday here are the topics we're going to\ncover it seems there are three key areas\nthat I really want to cover so the first\nin the first area is an introduction to\nn CSF 2.0 what is it right why is it\neven important why are we looking at\nthis and then the main part of today's\ntraining would be the N CSF 2.0\ncomponents so there are several key\ncomponents within it that make it that\nmake the framework what it is so we'll\nbe doing a deep dive into those\ncomponents and then at the end we're\ngoing to talk about the implications for\nit cyber security audit and compliance\ncareers and then we'll have Q&A at the\nend I may allow some Q&A in the middle\nbut let's see how we we we do with time\nbecause I know we have some limited time\ntoday but definitely make sure that if\nyou have questions you can put them in\nthe chat or when I ask for questions at\nthe end you can speak up and ask for\nthem okay I'll ask your questions so\nlet's take a look at this I'm going to\nstop my camera just for a bit so that we\ncan get into the main slide here and\nthen I'll be back on camera for um other\nparts of the\ntraining all right so our first topic\ntoday is an introduction to NIS CSF 2.0\nwhat is NIS CSF 2.0 okay so let's take a\nlook at the official definition first I\nalways like to go through the official\ndefinition first before we then talk\nabout it in simple terms that you guys\ncan all really understand so from the N\nCSF website and um at the end of class\ntoday I'll send um an update where you\nguys will get all the different links\nbut from this n CSF website the\ndefinition of the CSF framework is that\nthe cyber security framework work\nprovides cyber security risk management\nguidance to companies and so when we say\ncompanies this could be Industries or\ngovernmental agencies nist is a\ngovernmental agency so a lot of what\nthey do applies to both public\norganizations as well as government\nagencies so that's what the framework is\nfor and the cool thing about NSF 2.0 is\nthat 2.0 is the updated version the good\nthing about this is it can be used by\nall organizations so whether your\norganization is small regardless L of\nthe industry it's in whether it's in\nhealth care or manufacturing or again a\ngovernment agency or even regardless of\nthe maturity level did they just start\nbuilding out a cyber security function\nor do they already have a function\nthat's been active for years right\nregardless of that companies can use\nthis framework to understand prior\nassess prioritize and communicate their\ncyber security efforts so those are four\nkey wordss from the N CSF website but\nbefore we keep going into an\nintroduction here one of the challenges\nthat I've typically seen is that people\ndon't even understand what a framework\nis so when they don't understand what a\nframework is it's difficult them for uh\nit's difficult for them to understand\nwhat we're talking about so before I get\ninto the specifics of nist let's talk\nabout what a framework is as a reminder\nsome of you might know this from my\nclass already but let's do a quick\nrefresher on that so that when we come\nback to the definition you will you will\nbetter understand what n\nis so what is an IT framework an IT\nframework provides guidance on best\npractices so let's say that again an IT\nframework provides guidance on best\npractices that can be used to develop\nthe it cyber security control um\nenvironment of an organization so let me\ncome on camera because I want you guys\nto really get this piece when you have a\nframework the framework is not telling\nyou exactly what to to do the framework\nis giving you an outline and it's\ntelling you what the best practices are\nout there right that a company should\nconsider implementing into their\nOrganization for them to have a good\ncontrol environment so again when you\nthink of Frameworks always think of it\nas this is providing guidance it's not\nprescriptive it's not telling me exactly\nwhat to do but as an organization the\nframework is telling us this is what\nwe've seen work in other places so this\nis what you might want to consider when\nyou are putting it control environment\ntogether so based on that right some\nexamples we know are nist and there are\nso many different Frameworks for nist\nright we have CSF RMF 853 there's so\nmany different ones but that's an\nexample we have Koso we have kobit right\nbut the key thing I want you to learn or\nremember is that the framework is not a\nstandard so this is not SS 18 it's not\nPCI and it's not a law likee socks that\nsays You must meet this requirement it's\ngiving guidance on what you should do in\norder to have an effective control\nenvironment and the benefit of following\nFrameworks is that once you have a good\ncontrol environment then you have a\nhigher chance right of meeting any other\nstandards that you have to comply with\nlike SSA 18 PCI ISO and things like that\nall right so based on now you guys\nbetter understanding let me do this\nthere's folks trying to get in hold on\nsorry okay so based on based on that\nbetter understanding of what a framework\nis let's now go back to the definition\nright so the framework is providing risk\nmanagement guidance so this is very\nspecific to cyber security risk\nmanagement guidance for Industries\ngovernment agencies and other\norganizations so hopefully that\ndefinition of um a framework is is now\nhelping you better understand why n CSF\nis even a thinge why is it that people\nneed to why is it that people are\ntalking about n CSF 2.0 and why is it\nimportant it's because it's giv that\nframework of how the cyber security risk\nmanagement should be handled in an\norganization so that they have Best in\nClass best practices okay so let me you\nput this in simple terms you know I like\nto put things in simple terms so in\nsimple terms the CSF is intended to\nprovide guidance on practices and\ncontrols it is not to prescribe specific\noutcomes what do I mean by that it's not\ntelling organiz gations you have to do\nABC in order to get this outcome it's\ntelling organizations here are the\nthings you should consider for your it\nprocesses for your it controls so that\nyou can be compliant well so that first\nof all you have a good well-designed it\nenvironment which in turn will help you\nbe compliant with the standards that we\ntalk about in our it audit programs and\nfor just to wrap this section off\nbecause we're going to use the word\noutcome a lot in this um training so I\nwant you to understand what what I mean\nby outcome the outcome means what the\ncompany is looking to achieve what do\nthey really want their cyber security\nposture to look like because the reality\nis a small M and pop you know private\ncompany that doesn't do a lot on cyber\nsecurity might not want a very rigorous\nor robust cyber security risk posture\nlike Walmart ra or like Amazon that's\nexposed to a lot of risk so companies\nget to decide what outcome they want and\nthen based on the outcome they want then\nthey have the ability to say that's what\nwe want and this is how we're going to\nfollow this guidance in order to achieve\nthat outcome all right so that gives you\nthe introduction to CSF now based on\nthat definition and understanding that\nthe CSF is providing a framework or\nguidance on how to perform controls\nwe're now going to dive deep into what\nCSF is what the different components are\nand then we'll continue with the\ntraining there\nokay\nall right so let's do\nthis the next section all right so the\nnext section that we're going to cover\nin today's training is what are the N\nCSF 2.0 components and we're going to\ncover a lot here so I'm going to preface\nthat by saying don't worry you don't\nneed to memorize all of this today I\nwill be sharing links to the actual n\nCSF documents and the site where you can\ndownload the different documents and\nthen whenever I put this on the course\nwebsite it also will be uploaded so for\ntoday just focus on understanding and\nthinking through how this impacts or um\nimpacts or the implications for your\ncareer okay so let's talk about the N\nCSF 2.0\ncomponents there are three to there are\nthree components to n CSF 2.0 okay so\nthe first one is the CSF core second is\nCSF organizational profiles and third is\nCSF tiers we're going to go through each\none in detail but just to do a quick\nintroduction so you have an idea of what\nwe're talking about the CSF core is\nreally the meat right the main part of\nthe N CSF um 2.0 it's it shows the\nhierarchy of functions and if you don't\nunderstand what this terms mean that's\nokay I'll be explaining those in a\nlittle bit but it shows the hierarchy of\nfunctions categories and subcategories\nthat detail the outcomes that a company\nwants and we'll talk about those in\ndetail don't worry and then the\norganizational profile oh there's a typo\nthere sorry but the organizational\nprofile is showing the current and the\ntarget profile that the organization\nwants and then the tiers is the\ncharacterization of the rigor so\nremember earlier I said organizations\nget to choose whether or not or the\nlevel of cyber security risk management\nthey want so the ti is what helps\norganizations determine what it is or\nthe level that they want okay so the cor\nis the hierarchy of functions the\norganizational profile shows the current\nand the target Prof profile for the\norganization and sorry about that typo\nwe'll address that later but then the\ntiers shows the rigor what's the rigor\nof the risk management practices that\nthe organization wants okay all right so\nlet's go ahead and talk about the CSF\ncore and this is the main part of\ntoday's\ntraining so as I mentioned earlier the\nCSF core is the hierarchy of functions\ncategories and subcategories that detail\nthe outcomes right that detail what is\nit that a company wants to achieve and\nthere are six main functions previously\nbefore CSF 2.0 the Govern that first one\nyou see there was not there we just had\nidentify protect detect respond and\nrecover but one of the big changes with\nthis particular framework this\nparticular version is that the Govern\nfunction was added so this is just a\nquick overview of what it looks like in\nthe N presentation and or in the N\ndocument and what you'll see here is\nthat govern if you look at this image it\nreally goes around the N cyber security\nframework so let me ask you guys a\nquestion I want this to be a little bit\ninteractive here when you hear govern\nright you guys have been in my it a\nclass we talk about compliance some what\ndo you think of when you hear the word\ngovern what what's the first thing that\ncomes to mind there's an acronym right\nthat should come to your mind when you\nhear the word govern what's that acronym\nand if you can't speak up you can just\nput it in the chat let's see there's an\nacronym that has the word g in it\nI just gave you the answer GRC exactly\nexactly GRC so believe it or not\npreviously n tsf did not have the G it\ndidn't have govern in it now the reality\nis that it was kind of embedded in all\nthe other areas but what they've done\nwith cfsf 2.0 is they've actually\nbrought it out and kind of called it out\nas its own function as opposed to being\nembedded in the other six the other five\nfunctions so now there are six functions\nwe have govern identify protect detect\nrespond and recover and we're going to\ntalk about each one of those as we go\nthrough the training today\nokay and here is just a very high level\nview of again the five functions and the\nyou can see on the screen we have the\nGovern function and then you have the\ncategory so remember the core function\nhas the the function the category and\nthe subcategories which we'll take a\nlook at but this goes to some sumarize\nright what the functions are and the\ncategories so let's go into each\nfunction so that we can get a better\nunderstanding of what it is and I'm\ngoing you guys are going to start\nunderstanding because now you'll see the\nrelationship with some of the other\nthings you've\nlearned so the Govern function this is\nthe first function again this impacts\nall other functions the Govern function\nis really around uh establishing\npolicies procedures and processes and\none of the things that you guys have\nlearned from the it or the fundamental\ncourse is like the policies are very\nimportant the policies and procedures\nare important because they really detail\nthe um the processes the detail the\ncontrols so a governance function really\nneeds to have policies and process uh\nprocedures in place because that's\nwhat's going to Define what the\norganization should be doing so when you\nreview the Govern function for the Miss\nCSF 2.0 you need to understand that it's\na it's about establishing policies\nprocedures and processes that are\nmanaging the organizational um risk now\nthe risks don't have to be just it right\nbecause other risks also affect cyber\nsecurity so there could be regulatory\nrisks right because they need to be\ncompliant with things like maybe um\nsocks ssa1 18 PCI ISO you have legal\nrisk if there was a breach and they were\nsued what would happen right and if the\nbreach was caused by it systems right\nthe risk the environmental risk\noperational requirements there are so\nmany areas that need to be considered\nfor cyber security it's not always just\nit\nand the goal of the Govern function when\nyou think about this from a compliance\nperspective is that it's ensuring that\nthe cyber security strategy is aligned\nwith the organization's goals let me\ncome on camera and say this okay one of\nthe things I've always told you is that\naudit and compliance don't exist just\nbecause right because when you really\nreally think about it from a practical\nperspective audit and compliance are\ncost functions so when you think about\nwhen I say cost function I mean the a\ncompany is spending money money on them\nthey're not necessarily making money on\nthem so if you think about Amazon right\ntheir revenue function is when they sell\nwhen they make money by selling things\non the website when it comes to audit\nand compliance they're actually that's\nan expense function so it's a cost for\norganizations and that's why some\norganizations don't give it enough\nfunding until they have a problem right\nso that's why it's a cost function so\nthey don't exist just because at the end\nof the day audit and compliance has to\nbe linked back to the organizational\nstrategies okay audit and compliance has\nto be linked back to the organizational\nstrategy what are we trying to achieve\nas an organization what are the\ncompliance obligations we have because\nwe're in business as a business right do\nwe what regulations do we need to comply\nwith so the the Govern function then is\nconcerned with making sure that the\ncyber security strategy whatever\nstrategy they select is aligned with the\ngoals objectives and obligations of the\norganization because can just say oh I\nwant to be um compliant U from a cyber\nsecurity perspective we're going to\nspend this high amount of money that the\ncompany can't even afford it has to\nunderstand what is reasonable based on\nthe business we're in based on what the\norganizational goals are and based on\nwhat we need to comply with so that's\nthe main thing about govern function and\nthen so when you look\nhere all right so with the Govern\nfunction right here are the categories\nand we'll take a look at sub categories\nat later on but if you look here I have\non the screen it has the Govern category\nand it also has the the function and the\ncategory and so the first thing you see\nis govern the acronym that using or the\nabbreviation is GV and then you have six\nkey areas here so the first category is\nthat the organ the organizational\ncontext like I was saying earlier you\nfirst need to understand what's the\nmission of the company what are the um\ncontractual or compliance requirements\nthat we need to meet so you need to\nFirst understand what business are we in\nwhat are we trying to achieve here\nhaving that context is what's going to\nhelp the Govern function implement or at\nleast design an appropriate level of\nstrategy or the appropriate strategy for\nthe organization okay then it ALS there\nhas to be a risk management strategy\nagain this is also part of the Govern\nfunction so with the risk management\nstrategy the you have to think about\nwhat are their priorities regarding risk\nso if you guys remember from it\nfundamentals when we talk about risk\nmanagement there are different ways\nright that a go a company can choose to\naddress risk they can accept it they can\nreduce it they can avoid it right or\nthey can transfer it so companies have\nto think about what are the appropriate\nstrategies that we want again based on\nour mission based on what we're trying\nto achieve based on our outcomes so you\nneed to understand from for for the\nGovern function they need to understand\nwhat that risk man management strategy\nis also we have roles responsibilities\nand authorities what does that mean so\nthis category is concerned about who is\nresponsible for what that's really it at\nthe end of the day who's going to be\nresponsible for each aspect of the cyber\nsecurity strategy the risk management\nstrategy right and also not just\nresponsible who's going to be\naccountable because sometimes the people\nthat are actually performing the work\nare not the people that are actually\nresponsible or accountable to it from a\nmanagement level and what are some of\nthe improvements that will be\nestablished and communicated to the\norganization the other part um the\nfourth um category is policy right what\nis the cyber security policy we've\ntalked about this when I talked about\nthe definition policies procedures\nprocesses need to be well documented so\none of the main categories for the\nGovern function is that you should have\na cyber security policy in place it\nshould be communicated it should be\nenforced enforced rather and also it\nshould be updated\nas\nnecessary then the fifth one is\noversight this is and we'll again we'll\ntake a look at the subcategories in a\nbit but oversight is how are we going to\nmanage and have General oversight around\nour cyber security risk management\nprogram because you're not just just\ngoing to create a program and that's it\nyou need to have activities risk\nmanagement activities that are done\nperiodically to make sure that somebody\nis monitoring and has overall oversight\nto ensure that whatever strategy is\nimplemented and in place is continuously\nworking and being improved as\nnecessary okay and of course any cyber\nsecurity supply risk management\nprocesses as well they need to be\nidentified established monitored and\nimproved so these are the six categories\nfor govern one of the things we'll do at\nthe end hopefully we'll have time is I'm\nactually going to pull up the CSF 2.0\nspreadsheet where you'll then see the\nsubcategories and you'll start to see\nhow this really links with a lot of what\nyou've already learned in the it a\nprogram so again the first function here\nis govern and it's providing that\noverall strategy it's for the risk\nmanagement function it's well not that's\nnot the word it's providing the overall\nstrategy for the cyber security risk\nmanagement as well as the policies and\nprocedures that need to be implemented\nokay so let's take a look at the second\none the second component is identify so\nwhen you think about identify right so\ngovern is setting up the strategy and\nthen the second thing is well the\nstrategy is in place we have everything\nworking what's the next thing that we\nneed to do identify is concerned about\nestablishing right an understanding of\nwhat the risks are to the systems now\nyou've gone you've gone from being very\nhigh level strategic to being more\ndetailed let's talk about what these key\nrisks actually are because we can have\npolicies and processes in place if we\ndon't do the work to actually identify\nthose risks then we wouldn't know how to\nmanage those risks and with this\nidentify function there are three key\ncategories you have Asset Management\nrisk assessment and Improvement okay so\nthe first one asset management what are\nthe assets that you have like first of\nall what are all the systems that are in\nplace servers computers the people\npeople are part of assets right people\nare assets to the organization the\nbuildings software companies use\nhundreds some well some large companies\nthey may have hundreds of applications\nand software that they use in the\norganization so asset management and\nthis could be a total role on its own\nasset management is really concerned\nabout let's make sure we have a full\ndocumentation of all the Assets in the\norganization because before you can\nactually identify the risks associated\nwith your organization you first have to\nknow what those assets are so that then\nyou can document what's the risk to the\nassets which is the second one so once\nyou first of all identify all your\nassets the second one is risk assessment\nwhat are the risk to all the assets\nright you need to understand what are\nthe risks to our Hardware what's the\nrisk to our software what's the risk to\nour applications to our buildings right\nto our people to the services that we\nprovide in the um Community what are\nthose risks and that's part of that risk\nassessment process where companies have\nto then make sure they conduct a\ndetailed risk assessment to understand\ntheir risk posture okay and then the\nthird one with identification is\nensuring that they are improvements\nright to the risk management processes\nand procedures so once they've\nidentified the risk essentially you can\nthink about this as the risk management\nprocess that says we know what our risks\nare how are we going to manage the risks\nand there are several steps there which\nwe cover in our module on risk\nmanagement so I'm not going to go back\nthrough all of that but this is\nidentifying how do we manage and improve\non our risk areas all right so the\nsecond function is identify and the um\nacronym for that is ID that's what\nyou're using so when you see ID in CSF\n2.0 is referring to the identify\nfunction so first we have strategy which\nis govern second identify you're\nidentifying your risks by identifying\nyour assets and risk assessment and then\nwe are going to talk about the third one\nwhich is protect\nso if you guys recall do you guys let me\nmake this interactive make sure you guys\nare still with me do you guys recall the\nfirst layer of Defense who wants to\nremind us what's the first layer of\nDefense from it fundamentals\ncourse operations the process owners the\nprocess owners okay I see in the chat\nprocess owners so when you think about\nprotect and I'm trying to link this with\nthe audit program because I I want you\nto understand why what you've learned is\nimportant here as well protect is really\nwhere you are implementing the\nsafeguards what are the safeguards they\nare the controls right so you are\nimplementing the critical safeguards to\nensure the delivery of this is the\ndefinition from CSF the critical\ninfrastructure services or the services\nthat the organization is providing so\none of the main things here is when you\nthink about protect is who's actually\nimplementing the guards and the controls\nall right so do you guys see now the\nnext screen let's talk about the protect\nfunction and again the acronym um that\nthey're using here is PR or the uh that\nprot PR for protect and then we have\nfive categories here the first one is\nidentity management authentication and\naccess control now I want you you guys\nall have light bulbs going off here is\nthat correct I hope you do let's see\nwhat is what do you think about when you\nthink about this first\none when we talk about our it\ngc's logical Access Control logical\nAccess Control right so the again that's\nwhy I wanted to start off with letting\nyou remember that the protect is this is\nwhere you're implementing the controls\nso the first category is around how do\nwe how how do we manage identity right\num authentication authorization and just\nall our logical IAL security and\nphysical security um controls this has\nso this category is saying these are the\nthings that you need to do to implement\nthose controls and then the second one\nis also awareness and training so if you\nguys remember from the program we talk\nabout policies but if you also remember\nwe just don't talk about creating\npolicies we also talk about making sure\nthat employees are informed of the\npolicies right that on a periodic basis\nemployees get the policy to review and\nsign off so there has to be awareness\nand training you cannot have a GRC\nfunction let me uh come on camera for a\nbit here you cannot have a security\nfunction that's sitting up there in\ntheir office right and putting all this\nstrategy together and all these controls\nand the actual people and employees in\nthe organization don't know anything\nabout it right if people are not trained\nif employees are not trained about\nfishing attacks and things like that\nthat's when they'll get emails and\nthey'll click on any link so when you're\nin a GRC function you you have to always\nremember that whatever strategy policies\nand procedures you're putting in place\nyou also need to inform your employees\non a periodic basis so that they are\naware so just some basic security\nawareness training on you know first of\nall what their rights are as a user how\nthey log into systems password\nmanagement because believe it or not I\nthink I've told you guys this story we\nhave sometimes seen employees put their\npasswords in the drawer like right there\nso that's not very secure right so just\nsome basic cyber security um tips and\nhow to avoid\nmalware well not knowingly usually it's\nan email they get that tells them to\nclick a link right kind of giving them\nthat awareness about this is what you\nshould or shouldn't do whenever you get\nefficient email okay so that's the\nsecond U category and then the third one\nis data security this is also a little\nbit linked to logical security but it's\nnot just about the systems it's about\nthe data how is the data in the system\nprotected so how is information in how\nhow is the data in the organization\nprotected so for anyone right that's\ngoing into the Privacy space this is a\npretty big one because there are whole\nlots of privacy rules around data right\nbut it's not just privacy so\nconfidentiality which is linked to\nprivacy integrity and Avail availability\nthat's the CIA Triad right so how is\ndata managed according to that and then\nthere's platform security so you have\nthe hardware right and the software and\nthen this is where you also have to\nthink about you know where it's are they\nusing paths for example platform as a\nservice and things like that how is the\nactual platform being protected so\nthat's where you have for example the\nvirtual platforms and then technology\ninfrastructure resilience so this is\nabout what's the risk strategy around\nensuring that assets continue all the\nassets that we identified in the prior\nfunction how are those ass what is the\nstrategy in place to make sure that\nthose assets continue to maintain\nconfidentiality in integrity and\navailability and organizational\nresilience when you think of the\nresiliences is essentially if there were\nan attack if something happened um how\nwill we be able to come back as a\nbusiness so think a little bit of that\nis the business impact analysis or\nDisaster Recovery might be a better\nexample so how how resilient is our\ninfrastructure against just any of the\nrisks that we've identified so to\nsummarize again when we talk about the\nprotect function this is about the\nimplementation of the actual controls\nright and the things that would actually\nhelp protect the it systems and the IT\nenvironment\nokay then the next one and I know you\nguys may have questions so what I'll do\nis we're about we'll wrap up this\nparticular section on the core\ncomponents or the core functions and\nthen I'll allow some questions before we\ngo into the next one because I can\nalready feel maybe you're starting to\nget some questions so let's talk about\ndetect so detect detect is when you\nthink detect I know you're already\nthinking detective controls which is\nperfect right but detect is um the\nfunction that's essentially making sure\nthat you have U activities and processes\nin place so that you can quickly um\ndetect if something goes wrong the\nearlier you identify a secur security\nincident the better so if something\nlet's say malare was downloaded on\nsomeone's computer today well you want\nto find out today you don't want to find\nout tomorrow or weeks down the line\nwhere it's already gotten a lot of data\nor or done wrecked a lot of Havoc really\non the organizational systems so the the\ntect function is about making sure that\nthere activities in place to identify\nthe occurrence of a cyber security event\nand again I think I gave you guys the\nanswer earlier this is where you make\nsure you have detective controls in\nplace you don't just have preventive\ncontrols right preventive controls is\nmore linked with protect but you and\nthose are to ident to prevent things\nfrom going wrong right but the tech is\nwe know things can go wrong what we want\nto make sure is that whenever something\ndoes go wrong we quickly identify that\nsituation and we put in place a process\nto quickly address it so let's take a\nlook here at the two categories for\ndetect so for detect you have again you\nwant to make sure that you find this\ncyber security potential incidents right\nand analyze them and there are two key\ncategories you have continuous\nmonitoring and adverse event analysis so\ncontinuous monitoring is essentially for\nthose of you um that might have some\ncyber security background or we might\nhave even talked about this in the it I\nthink we've talked about in one of the\nit um classes but essentially making\nsure that there are continuous\nmonitoring processes in place this is\nwhere you have security loging I think\nwe mentioned this in logical security\ntraining right where you have security\nlogging you have alert that are set up\nso that when certain thresholds are\ncrossed or when someone that doesn't\nhave appropriate access gets into a\nsystem all of those are being monitored\nand for those of you that may have some\nprior background in sock when I say sock\nI mean the cyber security sock those are\nthe folks when there are incidents they\nget more alerts right they get emails\nthings that going off in the Operation\nCenter and they know that something's\ngone wrong a ticket gets opened so that\nthat incident is monitored so I want to\npause because I actually mentioned a few\nkey different things there that I want\nyou to think back to when you're\nreviewing your it audit program when I\ntalked about continuous monitor we\ntalked about security monitoring which\nis part of logical security and we also\ntalked about alerts being set up that's\nalso part of that security monitoring\nand logging but then we also talked\nabout when the alerts go off and their\nincidents they are recorded and trapped\nto resolution right what part of our\nitgc is that let me see if you guys are\nfollowing in management from computer\noperations computer operations so are\nyou guys start you I hope I we're still\ngoing to talk about the implications\nlater but hopefully as I'm talking\nyou're already seeing the link with some\nof the things you've already learned so\nnow you're just seeing it from this\nframework perspective right so that's\ncontinuous monitoring and then the\nsecond one is adverse event analysis so\nwhenever it's just a fancy word for\nincident monitoring is what I'll say so\nit just means when something has gone\nwrong right right what do we do so\nusually when they are large potential\nnot just large when they are just\npotential incidents uh companies usually\nhave they might call it like a problem\nmanagement or Incident Management but\nthe goal here is saying that you analyze\nthe event you just don't say oh that's\nokay there has to be a process that deta\ndoes a detailed analysis of that event\nto determine if it's a real problem or\nif it's um a false positive so\ncontinuous monitoring is you just making\nsure that you have those logs and alerts\nand security monitoring in place but\nthen the actual analysis and this is\nalso linked to that Incident Management\nthat I talked about for computer\noperations this is where you are\nactually analyzing the event and trying\nto determine what to do and before\nclosing out the event you have to make\nsure that you've done a full analysis\nand you've determined what approach to\ntake and whether the issue is resolved\nor marked as a false positive the goal\nhere is making sure that that analysis\ntakes place in order to make the right\ndecisions\nokay all right so that's the detect\nfunction so let's do a quick summary\nright we started with strategy let well\nlet me see in the chat make sure you\nguys are still with me what was the\nfirst one you can put it in the chat\nwhat was the first\nfunction with the\nG govern so we had govern right so that\num concerned with the strategy was the\nsecond\none I don't you\nidentify right you're identifying your\nassets risks okay what the third one\nprotect protect this is where you\nactually implement the controls right\nand then the fourth one we just talked\nabout is detect respond detect yeah\ndetect yes so this is we have detect\nwhich you have your detective control\nyou have your continuous monitoring and\nthen making sure you're analyzing\nAdverse Events your Incident Management\nprocesses essentially okay good job guys\nyou guys are here\nand then the next one is respond okay\nwhat is respond so respond is it's kind\nof you can start seeing where there's a\nthread right so at the end we talked\nabout the impact or the adverse event\nanalysis so respond is actually where\nyou're taking action on those security\ndetected cyber security incidents so I\nthink I might have actually talked a\nlittle bit about this when I talked\nabout detect because I so I might have\nbloodred the lines for you but with the\nframework right the separating the\nactual response right so what do you\nactually do what are the actions you\ntake so this particular response\nfunction is supporting the ability to\ncontain the impact so you guys when I\nsay contain the impact what are you guys\nthinking now hopefully you're thinking\nabout impact and likelihood right so\nthat's our risk when you have a risk is\nimpact times like likelihood right so\nwhen you have the respond function it's\nsaying how do we analyze this incident\nand if it's a real incident right it's a\nreal issue how do we reduce the impact\nright so instead of it affecting all the\n5,000 computers in our organization\nlet's say there was a virus that was\nmistakenly downloaded on one um user's\ncomputer how do we quickly contain it so\nthat it doesn't spread to all the other\ncomputers in the network so that's just\nan example of what response you take\nright if there was a data breach how do\nwe stop it so that the data doesn't\ncontinue to flow out to the adverse\nparty right to the to the thread agent\nso let's make sure we have a response\nfunction in place all right so this\nitself is actually a function in\norganizations right because you have to\nplan for your response you have to\ncommunicate with the organization\nsometimes you know if you're unlucky and\nit's a data Bridge somebody has to\ncommunicate to the public right and then\nmore importantly what are the mitigation\nstrategies to make sure that the issue\nis contained all right so that's respon\nand I've probably talked a little bit\nabout this so we have respond Incident\nManagement so I I kind of went a little\nbit ahead when we're talking about the\nprior detect right but you can see how\ndetecting flows into actually responding\nso with your respond function you have\nIncident Management incident analysis\nincident response reporting and\ncommunication and incident mitigation\nall right so with this again you're\nconcerned with we've identified issues\nhow do we respond and address them step\nso Incident Management so again this is\nthe overall when you think about how you\nrespond to all the incidents that and\nhow you manage them but part of that is\nincident analysis right how do you\nconduct the analysis what do you need to\nreview do you need to bring in forensics\nexperts to see where it actually all\nstarted from right what do you need to\ndo and then you actually have to report\nso this is what I've always told you so\nwith audit and compliance you can't get\naway with um actually documenting so\nit's not just about having meetings and\ntalking about these things you actually\nhave to document and report on that\nincident response right and make sure\nyou also communicate so you have to\ncommunicate and you can see here so with\nthe reporting it's not just the\ndocumentation piece but you also have to\nmake sure you document and communicate\nwith agencies so if there's a data\nbreach you're usually required by law to\nreport that right so that's why\nsometimes you might get a letter in the\nmail that says oh your data was recently\npart of a data breach blah blah blah so\nthat's part of making sure you're\ncommunicating the incident right so\nmaking sure that you coordinate all of\nthat and then the mitigation this is the\nvery important piece how do we stop the\nimpact right how do we mitigate this\nissue and hopefully make sure that it\ndoesn't continue in the future so the\nrespond function has these four\ncategories and then the last one is\nrecover okay so recover\nmeans all right we had an incident\nwe've mitigated we've addressed but\nthings might have gone wrong right data\nis already out there some systems are\nalready very much compromised so how to\nrestore capabilities or another good\nexample is maybe a data center went\noffline right how do we restore\ncapabilities or services that were\nimpaired one thing I do want you to\nrealize is that this um detect respond\nrecover this doesn't have to be\nsomething that necessarily takes weeks\nor days this might be something if it's\ncritical enough that happens within\nhours so for example if um a data center\ngoes down let's say one of the AWS\nAmazon um Cloud centers right the data\ncenters let's say it goes down very\nquickly very quickly they probably have\na a failover um process in place right\nwhere they quickly move over to another\num site so their customers are not\nimpacted or so this might be within\nminutes or hours right so it doesn't\nbecause they're separated into different\nfunctions does not mean right that this\ntakes a length a long period of time\ndepending on the impact right that's\nwhere so that's where making sure you\nidentify and understand the risk comes\nin depending on the impact they would\njust quickly mobilize the whole team to\nmake sure that services are restored\nquickly all right and this is all about\njust improving that organizational\nresilience again thinking about disaster\nrecovery and making sure that companies\ncan get back to servicing their\ncustomers in a timely manner so let's\ntake a look at the categories\nhere all right there two categories here\nincident recovery plan execution and\nincident recovery communication so this\nis more around the restoration piece\nright so when during the prior phase\nwhere they are responding and they're\ngetting information together and they\nthey already say okay this is what we're\ngoing to do so very quickly restoration\nactivities need to take place to make\nsure services are brought back up and of\ncourse then communicated to all the\naffected parties so let's um think about\nthis sometimes I think I can't remember\nwhen this happened but there was a time\nwhere on our course platform right you\nguys were like I can't watch the videos\nI can't watch the videos something is\nwrong so when I checked my email I saw\nthat the company had sent me an email\nwhen the issue happened saying we notice\nthat our systems have have gone down\nright and so we're trying to resolve\nthis quickly but you may notice that\nyou're not able to play videos that is\nall part of their incident recovery plan\nit's making sure they communicate well\nfirst of all they are communicating with\nthe stakeholder because I'm a\nstakeholder as their customer they are\nletting me know there's an issue and\nthen whenever the issue is fixed I\nusually get another email that says this\nissue has been resolved and all services\nare back up sometimes it takes minutes\nsometimes it takes hours and then I\ncommunicate that to you so that's just\njust another practical way of seeing\nthis in in action okay so let's go back\nthrough this summary here I know we\ntalked a lot there right but I want to\ngo back through this summary for you to\njust um talk about what we talked about\nhere so there are six main functions\ngovern identify protect detect respond\nand recover so we govern again this has\nto do with our overall strategy we have\nthose categories here identify you want\nto make sure you identify your assets\nidentify the risks which your risk is\nassessment together protect is where\nyou're actually implementing those\ncontrols and the safeguards right so you\nhave your logical security awareness and\ntraining physical security data security\noverall platform security and the making\nsure you have resilience um controls in\nplace to help with your technology um\nresilience then you have detect so\ndetect has to do with making sure you\ncontinuously Monitor and that you are\nanalyzing Adverse Events respond is how\nwhen something's been detected and done\nour analysis how do we actually respond\nso you see there's a a process in place\nfor Incident Management how do you\nanalyze the incident how do you report\nand which is document and communicate\nwith your key stakeholders and how do\nyou actually mitigate meaning how do you\naddress the issue and prevent the issue\nfrom expanding and then the last one is\nrecover how do you execute that recovery\nplan and once everything is back up and\nrunning how do you communicate to your\nstakeholders so this is the core guys\nthis is the core core of CSF 2.0 and one\nof the things again I know at the end I\nsaid we'll talk about the implications\nfor your career but as I was going\nthrough this you guys should already\nhave been like okay now I see why all\nthose controls and things that P talks\nabout in the it audit program right I\nsee where that's coming from because\nagain audit is you're not auditing\ncontrols just for the sake of auditing\nyou are auditing controls because they\nare related to the organizational\nstrategy right the business needs what's\nthe business trying to achieve what are\nthe goals what are we trying to do here\nfrom an IT perspective so that's why you\nsee that several of these functions that\nI have on the screen I link to a lot of\nthe things that you already learned okay\nbut I also want to mention one thing I\nalso want to mention one thing CSF is\nCSF a prescription or does it prescribe\nexactly the way companies need to do\nthings let me see if you guys were\nlistening at the beginning is CSF\nprescriptive is it telling you this is\nexactly what you need to\ndo no that's good there are guidelines\nthey are guidelines and that's why you\ncan see that when I was describing these\nfunctions hold on people are trying to\njoin so when I'm when I was describing\nthe functions you could see that I\nstarted blurring the line somewhere\nbecause companies don't need to separate\nall their functions into six okay\ncompanies can choose to group this and\nsay you know what we're just going to\nhave one one function is going to have\ndetect respond and recover because you\nas we were walking through you you saw\nthe thread right you saw how everything\nwas related so what that means is but\nfrom a framework perspective it has to\nbe very very detailed so that companies\nthat are not that mature that may not\nhave that maturity or that understanding\nof cyber security so that you're really\njust breaking it down into little little\nvery explanatory pieces for them to say\nokay these are all the exact distinct\npieces you must have but as\norganizations mature the lines may be\nblurred but the key might be even it's\nif it's blurred all the act the\ncategories all the activities are still\ntaking place because that's what's\nimportant right what's important is not\nsaying show me how you have everything\nseparated into six functions no it's\nabout do you have those controls in\nplace have you made sure your you're\nsafeguarding your cyber security assets\nwhat do you have in place so I don't\nwant you to go out there thinking about\nthis from a very theoretical perspective\nor thinking about it from a textbook\nremember I always say I don't want to\ngive you don't want to give textbook\nresponses think about it from the\npractical application piece how is this\npractically implemented in organizations\nokay so that brings us to the end of the\ncore function but before I go on to the\nsecond one which is the CSF\norganizational profile let me see if you\nguys have any\nquestions\nokay all right so let's go on so the\nnext one is CSF organizational profiles\nright right so this this is our second\ncomponent I know we're a little bit over\ntime well no I said 60 to 90 minutes so\nwe're still good okay so this is the CSF\norganizational profile okay so what's\nthe CSF organizational profile and this\nis just simply the description of the\ncurrent and Target cyber security\nposture based on the core outcomes that\na company wants so let's just break that\ndown a little bit simpler there are two\nkey profiles that a company can choose\nto have one is their current profile\nthat essentially says this is currently\nwhere we are with our cyber security\nposture and then a Target profile that\nsays this is what we want this is where\nwe want to be this is our desired\noutcome for our risk management\nobjective okay just a very quick note\nbefore we go deeper into this very quick\nnote there's a concept called Community\nprofiles and this is where companies\nhave come together to develop a baseline\nprofile based on the industry so maybe\nretailers might say we're all in the\nsame retail industry we have similar\nrisks right so we're going to come up\nwith a profile that's generic for this\nindustry and anybody in the retail\nindustry can use that as a baseline if\nthey want and I'll show you what an\nexample of a profile looks like in a bit\nbut just wanted to mention this here as\nwell and like I said I'll share links\nand the files that related to this\ntraining now how do you create an\norganizational profile right because you\ncan just say current profile or Target\nprofile but how do you really create\ncreate that profile there are five steps\none you Scope it right so for scoping\nyou get gather information you create\nthe profile you analyze any gaps and\nthen you implement the action plan so\nlet's take a look at those five\nsteps so I know there are a lot of words\non the slide but I didn't want to\nshorten it too much for you guys but the\nfirst um piece is determining the scope\nof the organizational profile but before\nwe actually talk about that and\norganization can have multiple profiles\nright depending on the scope they might\nwant to have a profile for their cyber\nsecurity area they might want to have a\nprofile for the supply chain risks they\ncan choose to have different profiles\nthat focus on a different aspect of risk\nor a different aspect of the business\nbut at the end of the day before you\ncreate an organizational profile you\nhave to understand what's the scope\nright what is the scope based on the\nassumptions I want to make so if this is\njust for one particular part of of the\nlet's say Asset Management Area your\nprofile that you build will be all based\non Asset Management now that you've kind\nof put your scope together then you'll\nsay okay what information do I need\nright to I have my scope so if you think\nabout this in audit terms this is also\ntalking about where you actually start\ngathering information What policies are\nin place right and you can get\ninformation from lots of places the the\nrisk profile already created for\nEnterprises the requirements the\nstandards that need need to be followed\nso maybe this is based on having to meet\nPCI requirements so you'll need all\ninformation required for PCI DSS for\nexample but the second thing is making\nsure you gather the information that you\nneed the third one is actually then\nbased on understanding the scope of the\nprofile you want and the um um the\ninformation you've gathered you actually\ndocument okay these are the outcomes\nthat I want all right and again if you\nare in a particular industry that\nalready has a community profile you can\nleverage that as a starting point\ninstead of starting from a blank sheet\nand then the fourth part is okay so if\nthere's a gap between my current and\nTarget profile so I've already\ndocumented what I'm currently doing and\nI've documented where I want to be from\na cyber security risk posture\nperspective what's that Gap right and\nhow do I address them so this is where\nyou start documenting okay these are all\nthe risks we've identified these are the\nissues what's our plan of action how do\nwe address this the plan of action and\nmilestone it's called poam is very much\nin the federal space so you might not\nsee that in regular organizations they\nmight just call it a remediation plan\nright but in the NIT CSF 2.0 they are\nusing poam because that's a federal term\nbut you might just see this like a\nmitigation or remediation plan or\nsomething like that but essentially here\nyou're analyzing the gaps and then\ncreating an action plan to fix mitigate\nor address those\ngaps and then the last one is actually\nimplementing the plan so now that you\nhave a plan in place you actually follow\nthe plan to actually Implement controls\nthat will address the Gap right and then\nall that is um targeted at meeting that\nTarget profile so again similar to\nremediation plans this may have an\noverall\ndeadline so let's look at an example\nhere and I rush through those\ndefinitions because I know sometimes\nthey are theoretical I wanted to kind of\nget to the actual um def U example here\nso on the screen right so this is a\nsimplified example of this is the\noutcome that's desired right they want a\nconfiguration management practices that\nare established and applied very\nspecific so it's about our configur uh\nconfiguration management\npractices so what the current profile\nsays what are they currently doing right\nso the configuration of management\npolicy is there so this document I\nbelieve was created in 2024 by n right\nthat's when they issued it but you can\nsee here so it was last updated in 2022\nthat's well over a year there are\ninformal processes so you can already\nsee that this is not very very mature\nand so the status here is saying\nconfiguration management is partially\nimplemented within the organization some\nsystems don't follow Baseline so they've\ndone an internal rating saying this is\nthree out of five again because this is\nan outcome that the company is saying\nthat it's important to them they've\nrated it as a priority and then this is\nwhat they're saying their target profile\nis right they want configuration\nmanagement to be very specific to\nactually be used and enforced in the\norganization and that any control that\nthe policy requires change control\nprocesses to be followed so you guys\nalready know that if any changes need to\nbe made to the configuration of a um\ncompany they need to follow change\nmanagement controls or the change\nmanagement process right so maybe in the\ncurrent profile they're not doing that\nright because it says change control\nprocesses are not consistently followed\nso the target is saying this is what we\nwant and then the procedures which are\nmore detailed are saying that okay so\neach division will have a CH\nconfiguration management plan it's going\nto be maintained implemented enforced\nthe settings will also well and the\nsettings well let me read that\ndifferently um as well as it maintains\nimplements and enforces configuration\nbaselines and settings so it's saying\nall the configuration baselines let's\nthink passwords to make it easy right so\nall the password configurations and\nsettings need to be properly implemented\nto be enforced to be documented right\nand if there are any changes it needs to\nfollow our change management process so\nyou can see that they are at a certain\nplace and they have a Target so they\nneed to identify the gap for example\nchange control processes is not being\nfollowed and here change control\nprocesses are being followed so they\nneed to identify those gaps and say what\ndo we actually need to do and Implement\nas an organization to make that a\nreality so so even though I went through\nthose five steps I think this might have\neven made it clearer I went through\nthose five steps because that's what we\nhave in this CSF 2.0 but this is what\nthe Practical implication is right it's\nnot about stating the five steps to risk\nprofile it's about actually being able\nto identify where the current what the\ncurrent profile is where we're trying to\ngo with our Target what the Gap is and\nhow to address them okay so this is an\nexample and on the screen here so in\norder to get to that summary that I just\nshowed you right CSF has put together\nthis document so it's all accessible on\nthis CSF 2.0 site I'll share links to\nthat but uh and I just copied a\nscreenshot of just a part of it because\nit's a pretty long document but you can\nsee right included in profile means is\nit part of the scope of this particular\nprofile remember you can have different\nprofiles depending on scope so you get\nto answer all those questions was the\npriority was the status and the policies\nand the internal practices roles\nresponsibilities evidence so essentially\nall this information that you gather\nremember that second step was making\nsure you gathered information right for\nyour current and also for your Target\nthat's what will help you after you get\nand document all this information that's\nwhat's going to help you actually put\ntogether this summary that tells you\nwhat you need to do okay all right so\nlet me pause there that's it for the CSF\nthe organizational profile so I shared\nit template and an example all right so\nlet's go through the third section and\nthen so we've done our Q&A let's go\nthrough the third section and then we'll\nwrap up so thank you all for hanging out\nwith me here today so the third one is\nCSF tiar right now CSF tiar like I was\nsaying earlier is the characterization\nof the rigor like let me use simple\nterms this is essentially saying how\nserious do we want to be about our risk\nmanagement practices like do we want to\nbe tier one tier two tier three or here\nfor partial risk informed repeatable or\nadaptive like organizations do get to\nsay what level of risk they want to be\nin because again when you think about\nrisk when we talk about risk response\nright some companies you can avoid you\ncan transfer you can accept right you uh\nmitigate so there are different ways\ncompanies all are in business for\ndifferent things and depending on the\ndifferent area right so for different\nareas for one area they might say oh\nthis area is serious enough we want to\nmake sure that we're are tier three\nright or this area is not that critical\nbut so we just want to be tier two in\nthis area so the CSF tiers are\nessentially just saying what is the\nrigor that we want to say we have for\nour risk governance and then based on\nthe tier they've selected that's what\nthey then use to inform their\norganizational profile right so based on\nwhether they want to be tier one two\nthree or four when they put their\norganizational profile together it'll be\nbased on that maybe everybody doesn't\nwant to be adaptive at that very high\nlevel for configuration management maybe\nthey just want to be risk informed\nthat's their decision to make of course\nthat would be based on a risk analysis\nof them determining that if any risk in\nthat area was actualized they'll be fine\nwith it right so they've already done\nthat risk analysis but companies do get\nto choose that and then again those tiar\ncan be used to set the tone for\norganizational risk management across\nall the different areas so again\ndifferent parts or different aspects of\nan organization they might select\ndifferent tier if they want so for\nexample just a quick explanation partial\nis when it's kind of ad hoc maybe they\ndon't really have a lot of policies or\nit's not really followed up on it's we\nkind of do it when we need to right U\nrisk informed there's awareness right so\nwe know there are risks but we may not\nfully have organization wide um risk\nmanagement process so maybe within this\ndepartment we do something but it might\nbe different in another department and\nwe may not all see what each other is\nseeing but we all know what the risks\nare um repeatable this is where you have\nformal processes right so they approved\nthey reviewed periodically it's\nessentially a pretty good process where\nit's consistent to a certain level and\nyou can repeat it and then tier four is\nadaptive so this is formal organization\nwide approach let's say there's a change\nmanagement process a policy that\neverybody knows about so we choose that\nwe want to be adaptive in all areas or\ncertain areas and that just means we are\nvery very mature in that specific area\nOkay so that's really it for tiers so\nthe tiers really are how is a tier\nselected for the different area and\nbased on that tier selection the\norganizational profile is created which\nwould be the current and the Target that\nwould then need to be analyzed for a gap\nfor The Gap\nanalysis okay\nall right so we're about to wrap up guys\nthank you we might be a few minutes over\nso please bear with me so again here are\nthe three components that we discussed\nand I mentioned this was the core part\nof the training right so you have the\nCSF core CSF organizational profiles and\nCSF tiers CSF core is the main piece\nright so that's where you have those six\nfunctions that we mentioned categories\nand subcategories that detail the\noutcomes right then you have the actual\nprofiles that describe the current and\nTarget postures and then you have the\ntears that just say you know what level\nhow serious do we want to be with our\ncyber security risk governance what are\nwe comfortable with in actuality all\nright so that's the summary there so\nlet's talk about the last section here\nand I think this is where you guys would\nhopefully get some additional value so\nwhat does this all mean I'm sure if you\nguys were on LinkedIn the last few weeks\nraise your hands if you're like me\neverybody wants to talk about n CSF 2.0\nand everybody's running what is it how\ndoes it affect me is that you let me\ncheck the chat chat like what does it\nmean hold on let me see the chat K said\nyes okay honestly at the end of the day\nthat's why when I started and I talked\nabout the\ndescription or the definition it's a\nframework okay let me come on camera\nhere a little\nbit it's really a framework that\norganizations are using or that\norganizations can use to develop their\ncyber security risk uh management\nstrategy and their profile the framework\nis intended to help with the design of\nthe environment so let's talk about how\nthis might be the imple Implement\nimplication sorry the implication for\naudit and compliance all right so let's\nI actually put both on the same slide I\nshould have separated them but that's\nokay if you're in the audit space you\nmight get to work with companies to\nperform a gap assessment between okay\nhere's your current profile and here's\nyour target profile I can't remember who\nhas someone asked the question about\nwhat do I do if I want to develop a\nprofile for a customer because you're an\nauditor right when you've gone through\nthis you've gone through my it\nfundamentals class we've talked a lot\nabout controls you learned a lot about\ncontrols you learned about the control\nconsiderations why they're implemented\nand how they implemented and what that\nshould have done for you is not just\ntell you how to test controls it tells\nyou the importance of controls and with\nreverse engineering it tells you how to\nimplement controls so let me see in the\nchat right can you guys if someone comes\nto you and says we're having some issues\naround logical security we have\nprocesses that are not really mature or\nour access management process is not\nreally mature what are some of the\nthings that we can do based on trying to\nget to a more mature level do you feel\nlike you will be able to tell them at\nleast five to six more really but let's\njust go low five to six controls that\nthey should Implement to help fix that\nGap let me see you in the chat or you\ncan speak up\ndo you all get that\nquestion yes and I see a lot of yeses in\nthe chat and that's exactly what the\nimplication is because you now know more\nwhat about what CSF is as a the\nframework you understand the concept\nthat the core functions are giving that\nideal right of this is where things\nshould be but most companies are not\nideal they will have gaps so your\nknowledge of an auditor as because I'm\nauditing and this is what I'm looking\nfor it gives you that unique vantage\npoint on this is what you need to have\nto fix the Gap and there are so many\nrules that are really around that\nremediation management Gap assessment\nand your it audit knowledge makes you\nthe perfect person to be able to say\nthis is wrong this is how you fix it\nright so that's one implication so it\ndoesn't change much from what you're\nactually doing it maybe just changes the\nway you talk about it right you're still\nperforming that same function of\nunderstanding the if you're right I'm\ntalking from a perspective where you're\nbeing hired as internal audit not\nexternal right so you're being hired as\ninternal audit to come help them put\nthings in place so that's what I'm\ntalking about from that perspective so\nyour audit knowledge gives you that\nAdvantage so that's one and then this is\nalso linked to the other one so the\nfirst one was really more about Gap\nassessment and I think I kind of made it\nto the same thing but the second one\nagain you're using that your sub subject\nmatter knowledge on it controls it\nenvironment you're using that knowledge\nto suggest controls that they need to\nimplement so I think the question I\nasked kind of addressed both but again\nyou're testing against standards but\nyour knowledge of the framework and how\ncompanies are trying to implement it\ngives you that edge on how to help them\nso they might even call you and say you\nknow what I don't even know how to put\nmy profiles together come do a gap\nassessment so they may not call it an\norganizational profile because again\nit's a framework so an organization\nmight literally hire Auditors to come do\na gap\nassessment what's a gap assessment where\nare we and where do we need to be and\nthen based on the results of that Gap\nassessment identify and suggest controls\nthat need to be implemented to address\nthose gaps are you guys\nfollowing are you guys following do so\ndo you guys see how what you your role\nas an auditor or what you know as an\nauditor helps you based on what\ncompanies might be doing and another\nthing you need to remember some of the\nwords we use that are use in CSF may not\nbe what organizations use so like I said\nthey may not call it an organizational\nprofile they might say we just want to\nknow where we stand we want to do a gap\nassessment and I've actually done some I\nwhen I I used to work in Consulting we\ndid Gap assessments for companies so\nthink of it as a test so the Gap\nassessment is done as a fullblown we\nstill do the complete audit like we're\ndoing SSA 18 the difference is that it's\nnot going to be given to customers it's\na test so that they know where all their\nissues are they address those issues\nbefore we then do the full-blown real\naudit does do you guys see that example\nso that might be even socks socks like a\ngap assessment where are we and a lot of\ncompanies uh because socks is for public\npublicly traded companies right so if a\ncompany was private and then they're\npublic they have a period of time before\nthey need to be compliant with socks so\nduring that time a lot of them do Gap\nassessments right to know okay are we\nwhere we're supposed to be okay if we're\nnot how do we address it before our real\nassessment starts okay so that's just an\nexample of that implication for audit\nfor compliance roles think of the three\nlines of Defense the compliance function\nis essentially working hand inand right\nwith your first line of defense making\nsure you're implementing all those right\ncontrols so here they might be helping\norganizations I think this goes to the\nquestion that was asked earlier to\nactually develop their organizational\nprofile they might call it something\nelse but they are really just trying to\nsay this the same thing that we were\njust talking about Gap assessment but\nbeing done in internally from a\ncompliance function so remember the\ncompliance function can or is\nresponsible for the internal compliance\ncompliance with different regulations\nright and part of what compliance can do\nis say let's give an example so maybe\nit's a company that's not really mature\nand the compliance function is a new one\nthat's being implemented one of the\nthings they would then do is use a\nframework such as nist to guide how they\nstructure their compliance activities\nlet me pause there do you guys\nunderstand what I just said do you guys\nget what I just said about compliance\nand how you could use a framework so\nlet's say a framework for maybe a new\ncompany that's not mature or maybe some\na company that wants to just revamp his\ncompliance function one thing they could\ndo is say okay we're going to use this\nthis framework it doesn't mean they're\ngoing to copy it but they're going to\nuse that framework and consider it as a\nway to develop whatever they want to do\nfor their company they may not use all\nthe parts but they will just use it to\ninform the structure the governance\nstructure that they put in place let me\nsee if you guys are listening can you\nguys hear me am I still\nlive loud and clear okay so you guys see\nhow that imp the implication is right\nand then of course they need to work\nwith stakeholders to implement the\ncontrols to meet the target profiles and\ndesired outcomes so it's not just about\nsaying I know what the Gap is or I know\nwhat to implement actually compliance\nwould work to follow up make sure people\nare doing what they're actually supposed\nto do to really really move things\nacross the Finish Line okay so let's\nsummarize here and then we'll do a final\nQ&A before we wrap\nup so again as a reminder the CSF is\nintended to provide guidance on\npractices and standards it's not\nprescribing specific outcomes but those\nthe guide but the fact that it's not\nprescribing outcomes I don't want you to\nthink it makes it less important it's\nstill important because those guidelines\nare important right those guidelines are\nkey and they can make a difference\nbetween a company knowing what to do and\nwhat not to do because if a company\nactually follows a framework such as the\nCSF right it can help improve their um\ncontrol environment because and with\nthat improved control environment it\ngives them a better chance of meeting\nstand um their compliance requirements\nwith standards do you guys get that so\ndo you understand that so even though\nit's not prescribing outcomes it's\ngiving proper well I shouldn't use the\nword proper it's giving guidance right\non the it environment the controls and\nif a control environment is based on the\nCSF they've really done their job it can\nimprove their security posture which\nultimately helps them meet compliance\nneed so if they've done all they're\nsupposed to do when they need to perform\nan IT audit for whatever systems it\nshould technically be good and be\neffective if they followed the the\nstandard requirements U well I don't\nwant to call them requirements the\nstandard the guidance that was provided\nby CSF do you guys understand that\nbecause I want you to understand the\nlink between CSF the importance and why\ncompanies usually talk about Frameworks\nis because it tells them well it doesn't\ntell them what to do it tells them what\nto consider for implementation that\nwould overall then give them a better\noutcome with their compliance\nneeds are you guys still there with\nme yes okay great so I think that really\nis all I had for you today so let's do a\nquick review and then we'll do a Q&A at\nthe end review today you guys learn\nabout this CSF 2.0 I gave you the\ndefinition um the explanation we went\nreally detailed into the 2.0 components\nwhich what are the components guys let\nme see the\nchat what are the three components we\ntalked\nabout we just talked about three key\ncomponents for this CSF\n2.0 core organizational profile and The\nTear all right okay and with core we\nhave those six functions with profiles\nyou have the current and Target and then\nwe have those four tiers great and then\nwe talked about implications for your it\naudit and compliance career you having\nthis knowledge that I've shared with you\ntoday honestly it just lets you\nunderstand what it's about and then\ndepending on whether you go into audit\nand compliance what you're how you're\nworking in that organization might be\ndifferent what you might be called upon\nto do might be different but that's\nreally it and I think the the question\nwe got earlier about a practical example\non how you would um respond to a hack or\nsomething based on a framework or\nguidelines that kind of gives you that\nexplanation as well so thank you all for\njoining me I did want to make sure I\ngive you guys this bonus so that you\nguys understand how to review and\npotentially what's the word I'm looking\nfor interpret that's the word to review\nand interpret the information in the\nframework and then also align it with\nwhat you've already learned in the\ncourse so thank you all I see you all in\nthe chat you guys have a great rest of\nthe day so thank you everybody for\njoining me for the session today if you\nhave any questions please let me know\nthanks guys\n",
