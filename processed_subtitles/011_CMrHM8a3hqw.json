  "text": "star wars fans would be familiar with\nthe golden life-sized hospitality robot\nc-3po while star wars might be set in a\ngalaxy far far away the reality of\nhaving machines talk and respond to us\nin a human-like manner is already a\nreality which keeps getting more and\nmore realistic with every passing day\nthe people you ask for queries on\nwebsites your smart assistants even\ncalls made over the internet all of them\nhave one thing in common none of them\nare actually human\nnow you must be thinking if they are not\nhuman how do they manage to sound and\nseem so human-like how do they respond\nto me so intelligently and how are they\nso articulate\nthis my friends is the magic of natural\nlanguage processing\nwhat is nlp\nnatural language processing or nlp\nrefers to the branch of artificial\nintelligence that gives the machines the\nability to read understand and derive\nmeaning from human languages\nnlp combines the field of linguistics\nand computer science to decipher\nlanguage structure and guidelines and to\nmake models which can comprehend break\ndown and separate significant details\nfrom text and speech\nevery day humans interact with each\nother through public social media\ntransferring vast quantities of freely\navailable data to each other\nthis data is extremely useful in\nunderstanding human behavior and\ncustomer habits\ndata analysts and machine learning\nexperts utilize this data to give\nmachines the ability to mimic human\nlinguistic behavior\nthis helps save millions in terms of\nmanpower and time as you don't need to\nalways have a person present at the\nother end of a phone\nnlp is also a lot more widespread than\nyou may realize you use it every day in\nseemingly normal and insignificant\nsituations don't know how to correctly\nspell a word\nautocorrect has you covered\nneed to see if your article or thesis\nwill get flagged for copyright\nviolations\nthat's okay a plagiarism checker will\nsearch through the web and find any\ncases of published documents which may\nmatch your work line by line\nwhile nlp seems really cool yet a\ncutting edge and complicated technology\nconcept\nit is actually pretty easy to learn you\nstart off with a document or an article\nto make your algorithm understand what\nis going on in it you need to process it\ninto a form which is easily\ncomprehensible by the machine\nthis is no different than making a child\nlearn to read for the first time\nyou start off by performing segmentation\nwhich is to break the entire document\ndown into its constituent sentences\nyou can do this by segmenting the\narticle along its punctuations like full\nstops and commas for the algorithm to\nunderstand these sentences we get the\nwords in a sentence and to explain them\nindividually to our algorithm so we\nbreak down our sentence into its\nconstituent words and store them this is\ncalled tokenizing where each word is\ncalled a token\nwe can make the learning process faster\nby getting rid of non-essential words\nwhich do not add much meaning to our\nstatement and are just there to make our\nstatement sound more cohesive\nthese words such as are and the are\ncalled stop words\nnow that we have the basic form of our\ndocument we need to explain it to our\nmachine\nwe first start off by explaining that\nsome words like skipping skips skipped\nare the same word with added prefixes\nand suffixes\nthis is called stemming we also identify\nthe base words for different word tense\nmood gender etc this is called\nlimitization stemming from the base word\nlemma\nnow we explain the concept of nouns\nverbs articles and other parts of speech\nto the machine by adding these tags to\nour words this is called part of speech\ntagging\nnext we introduce our machine to pop\nculture references and everyday names by\nflagging names of movies important\npersonalities or locations etc that may\noccur in the document\nthis is called named entity tagging\nonce we have our base words and tags we\nuse a machine learning algorithm like\nnaive bayes\nto teach our model humans sentiment and\nspeech\nat the end of the day most of the\ntechniques used in nlp are simple\ngrammar techniques that we have been\ntaught in school\nhere is a question for you\nwhich of these nlp techniques is used to\nobtain words from sentences\na stemming\nb\ntokenization\nc limitization\nd segmentation\ngive it a thought and leave your answers\nin the comments section below three\nlucky winners will receive amazon gift\nvouchers with the increasing demand for\nautomated language solutions companies\nare looking for nlp experts to join them\nand are prepared to offer highly\nlucrative salaries as well\nif you want to learn more about nlp you\ncan check out simplylearn's postgraduate\nprogram in ai and machine learning in\ncollaboration with ibm in this program\nyou will learn about frameworks like\nkeras and tensorflow and get hands-on\nexperience in deep learning to become a\ntruly experienced ai engineer that\nbrings us to the end of this video on\nnlp\nwe hope you enjoyed this video if you\ndid a thumbs up would be really\nappreciated here's
