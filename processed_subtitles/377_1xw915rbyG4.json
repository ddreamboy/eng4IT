let's take a look\nat the agenda for this session first of\nall I will give a brief introduction to\nwhat is predictive analysis and then I\nwill talk about various predictive\nanalysis techniques that we have moving\nfurther I will discuss how you can\nchoose the correct technique and finally\nto sum up this session I will discuss a\nfew predictive analysis models as well\nso I hope you are clear with the agenda\nalso don't forget to subscribe to your\nrekha for more exciting tutorials and\npress the bell icon to get the latest\nupdates on a tear a curve and do check\nout Eddy records machine learning\ncertification program the link is given\nin the description box below so without\nany further ado let us begin our session\nso what exactly is predictive analysis\npredictive analysis is the branch of\ndata analysis which is mainly used to\npredict future events or outcomes it is\nsolely based on data driven approaches\nand techniques to reach to conclusions\nor solutions the analysis mainly makes\nuse of analytical techniques and\npredictive modeling in order to find\nrelevant patterns in large data sets in\nturn these patterns can be used to make\nvarious opportunities in the businesses\nby identifying risk and benefit points\netc predictive analysis is an\nanticipatory technique for\nforward-looking solutions and insights\nto assess any situation most of the\nprocesses in the predictive analysis\nincorporates the machine learning\nterminologies and algorithms for model\nbuilding especially to train the models\nso it is significantly important to\nunderstand how to choose these\npredictive techniques for model building\nand as a beginner it can help you a lot\nalong the way so let us quickly take a\nlook at why we do predictive analysis\nand I'm sure most of us are aware of the\nsignificant increase in the generation\nof data all around us it has seemingly\nbecome quite clear since we are seeing a\nlot of data driven approaches but human\nhas been storing data since a very long\ntime documenting every detail has been a\nprevalent practice with the digital age\nit has become to process the data a lot\nmore easier as well but it has also\nopened a lot of opportunities for the\nyears and years of long and unprocessed\ndata to understand the relationship\nbetween various aspects of the data and\nmake use of it in real life as well if\nwe can use this data for you know\nvarious purposes we have like risk and\nfraud detection then there is market\nanalysis operational movements\noperational improvements campaigning etc\nand one simple example is to use the\nweather data to study the patterns and\nuse predictive analysis based on the\ninsights to predict the future events so\nlet's take a look at a few predictive\nanalysis techniques as well\nfirst of all we have regression guys so\nthe main role of regression is the\nconstruction of an efficient model to\npredict the dependent attributes from a\nbunch of attribute variables a\nregression problem is when the output\nvariable is either real or a continuous\nvariable that can be weighed or area or\nsalary etc we can also define regression\nas a statistical means that is used in\napplications like housing investing etc\nit is basically used to predict the\nrelationship between a dependent\nvariable and a bunch of independent\nvariables and simple linear regression\nis a regression technique in which the\nindependent variable has a linear\nrelationship with the dependent variable\nit is basically a technique to analyze\ndata set which has a dependent variable\nand one or more independent variables to\npredict the outcome in a binary variable\nmeaning it will have only two outcomes\nand the dependent variable is\ncategorical in nature dependent variable\nis also referred as target variable and\nthe independent variables are called as\nthe predictors logistic regression is\nbasically a special case of linear\nregression where we only predict the\noutcome in a categorical variable it\npredicts the probability of the event\nusing the log function next up we have\nclassification guys so classification is\na process of categorizing a given set of\ndata in two classes and it can be\nperformed on both structured or\nunstructured data\nthe process starts with predicting the\nclass of given data points and classes\nare often referred to as target label or\ncategories the classification predictive\nmodeling is the task of approximating\nthe mapping function from input\nvariables to discrete output variables\nand the main goal is to identify which\nclass or the category the new data will\nfit into now let us try to understand\nthis with a simple example gaze so a\nheart disease detection can be\nidentified as a classification problem\nand it's a binary classification since\nthere can only be two classes which is\nbasically has a heart disease or does\nnot have a heart disease so the\nclassifier in this case needs training\ndata to understand how the given input\nvariables are related to the class and\nonce the classifier is trained\naccurately it can be used to detect\nwhether heart disease is there or not\nfor a particular patient since\nclassification is also a type of\nsupervised learning even the targets are\nalso provided with the input data and\nthen we have clustering guys so\nclustering is basically you know\ndividing data points into homogeneous\nclasses or clusters so the points in the\nsame group are as similar as possible\nand then the points in different groups\nare as dissimilar as possible so when a\ncollection of objects is given we put\nthe objects into group based on\nsimilarity so that is what clustering is\nall about and then we have another\ntechnique which is time series guys so\nthe time series model comprises a\nsequence of data points captured using\ntime as the input parameter it uses the\nlast year of data or you know the\nprevious data to develop a numerical\nmetric and predicts the data using that\nmetric is basically a means of\nunderstanding a singular metric is\ndeveloping over time with a level of\naccuracy beyond simple averages so it\nalso takes account a seasons of the year\nor events that could impact the metric\nas well and next up we have forecasting\nso forecasting is nothing but using the\nhistorical data to make predictions or\nnumeric predictions on a new data based\non the learning from the previous data\nnow that we know what these various\ntechniques are let us understand how to\nchoose which one would be the best one\nfor us while working on any data\nso there are a few factors that you\nshould consider while choosing a model\nbut before that before talking about\ngood siding factors let us go through\nthe processes before a predictive\nanalysis before you start building the\nmodel first we have the problem\nstatement I so problem statement tells a\nlot of things about the project on how\nyou should approach it if we were\nlooking at the problem statement you'll\nbe able to know what kind of or target\nyou are looking at so in a heart disease\ncondition let's say for an example we\nhave a problem statement to decide or to\nanalyze or predict if a patient has a\nheart condition or not so with that said\nwe have already figured out the target\nvariable which is gonna be categorical\nin nature which means it basically will\nhave only two values that is one has a\nheart disease or does not have a heart\ndisease so it becomes quite clear to us\nin the problem statement only they're\ngoing to use the classification\ntechnique in this particular example but\nthen there are a few problems where you\nwill not be able to figure out which\nkind of target variable you will be\nchoosing on what are all independent\nfactors will be involved in your\nanalysis so you move on to the next one\nwhich is extraction and loading and you\nbasically analyze all your data you know\nand transform it and try to make use of\nfor all the information that you get\nfrom visualization and all these\nprocesses to understand what kind of\nvariables you are looking at and then\ncomes the factors to consider before\ngoing for the model which is what is the\ntarget variable so if the target\nvariable is continuous you should go for\nthe regression analysis and if the\ntarget variable is categorical you can\ngo for the classification analysis and\nif you are not able to find a target\nvariable don't worry guys you can\nprobably go for a clustering analysis so\nyou'll know which points are similar\nwhich points are not similar making it a\nclass if you know making clusters and\nthen you can perform classification on\nthose clusters as well the next question\nyou should be asking is is your data\nlinearly separable and there is no\ndirect way to actually determine it so\nwe can go ahead by choosing different\nmodels I mean you can compare different\nmodels to see if your data is actually\nlinearly separable or not then the next\nfactor would be the size of the data you\nhave to look for a factors like the size\nof data to determine the possibility of\noverfitting and underfitting the model\nalso some models may not work\nefficiently with small\nso these are some deciding factors for\nchoosing a model before you train the\nmodel with the training data and let us\ntake a look at a few machine learning\nmodels so that we can use for predictive\nanalysis the first one is linear\nregression so linear regression is to be\nused when the target variable is\ncontinuous and the dependent variable or\nvariables is continuous or a mixture of\ncontinuous and categorical and the\nrelationship between the independent\nvariable and the dependent variable has\nto be linear so that is when you know\nwhen you can use a linear regression\nafter that we have logistic regression\nso logistic regression does not require\na linear relationship between the target\nvariable and the dependent variables the\ntarget variable is binary assuming value\nof either 1 or 0 or maybe you know true\nor false something or dichotomous as\nwell\nthen we have the k-means clustering\nmodel guys so k-means involves placing\nunlabeled data points in separate groups\nbased on similarities and this algorithm\nis used for the clustering model as well\nafter that we have neural networks so\nneural networks help to understand or\nhelp to cluster and classify the data\nguys so these algorithms are modeled\nloosely after the human brain and are\ndesigned to recognize patterns then we\nhave decision tree so a decision tree is\na map of the possible outcomes of a\nseries of related choices it allows an\nindividual or organization to weigh\npossible actions against one another\nbased on their costs probabilities and\nbenefits as the name goes it uses a tree\nlike model of decisions and they can be\nused either to drive informal discussion\nor to map out an algorithm that predicts\nthe best choice mathematical after that\nwe have time series guys so the time\nseries aggression analysis is a method\nfor predicting future responses based on\nresponse history and the data for a time\nseries should be a set of observations\non the values that a variable takes at\ndifferent points in time so these are a\nfew models that we have for predictive\nanalysis and these are only a few models\nand there are other models also that we\ncan use for predictive analysis and with\nthat said let's also see a few\napplications of predictive analysis so\nwe can use it for finance guys\nso predictive analysis in finance can\nhelp in identifying the risk detection\nor the risk detection model to identify\nany fraudulent transactions or loans\nthat you can detect using the predictive\nanalysis then there is stock prediction\nas well you can gather a lot of data in\ntime and forecast a prediction that can\nbe taken into account for different\nstocks and there goes a lot of process\nbehind this but for as far as the\napplication goes stock prediction is a\npretty good application of predictive\nanalysis in finance then we have\ngovernment's guys so governments are\nusing predictive analysis for\ncampaigning using it for better\ndetection weather prediction that is\ndisaster management they're using\npredictive analysis for you know\npredicting the impact of policies\ndifferent policies that you're making\nand they're making surveys etc we can\nuse the addictive analysis in healthcare\nfor early detection of diseases such as\ncancer any heart ailments that may or\nmay not be a part of your life several\nyears later so it helps in predicting\nall those diseases or you know\nconditions at an early stage and we can\nalso use predictive analysis in\nmanufacturing we can actually identify a\nproduction failures and walk on it using\nthe prediction analysis then there is\npoor franchisees using our predictive\nanalysis - you know predict the outcome\nof certain events in the leagues or\nsomething like that they're trying to\nmake sense of what kind of match they\nhave the best probability or the best\nprediction of winning the chances of\nwinning there or if they don't have any\nwinning chances what about you know the\nbasic points or basic insights that\nthey're getting from the data that they\nshould work on to win that particular\ngame or a match or only and then they\nhave telecom industries using predictive\nanalysis for customer support you know\nthey're trying to segregate or segment\nthe customers into groups that they are\nable to work on them based on their\nprediction and now that we have come to\nthe end of the session guys I hope you\nare clear with
