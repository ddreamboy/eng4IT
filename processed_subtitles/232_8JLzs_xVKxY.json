  "text": "so as more and more of our lives are\ncaptured in\ndigital big data analytics is going to\nbecome increasingly\nubiquitous as a society we have the\nopportunity to choose if we want the\ninsights it generates to be used to\nexploit and manipulate us or to enrich\nour\nlives how we approach privacy will have\nthe single greatest impact on that\noutcome let's imagine a future where\nevery piece of information you see is\nfiltered by an algorithm you only see\nwhat it wants you to\nsee your favorite social networking site\nwhich you log into daily to check your\nnews feed needs to go advertising\nrevenue of diet\nproducts to do this it primes the pump\nby feeding new articles tailored to\nreinforce your body image issues\nthen when it observes a decrease in your\nself-confidence it pushes targeted\nadvertising at you to grab you while\nyou're at a low\napp I I lie not the social networking\nsite gets its advertising Revenue its\nclient sells lots of diet products and\nyou end up feeling bad about\nyourself and it could be a lot worse I\npromise you um but the reality is it\ndoesn't have to be like this and I don't\nthink we want to live in a world where\nit's going to be like this\nlet's imagine instead instead of\nmanipulating you without your knowledge\nthe system was open and transparent with\nyou it shared the insights that it had\ngenerated and gave you options to choose\nfrom now maybe you still do end up\nbuying diet product or maybe you sign up\nfor cooking classes you join a gym or\nyou do nothing whatever you do it would\nhave been your conscious\nChoice Social Mobile and Cloud\nTechnologies are connecting us as never\nbefore and if we want to benefit from\nbeing part of this new Global human\nNetwork then we need to accept that much\nof our data is out there and is out of\nour immediate\ncontrol the reaction of many governments\nis is to suggest that we simply turn off\nthe data tab either by preventing data\nfrom being gathered or wrapping it in\ncomplicated regulatory\nFrameworks the problem with this\napproach is that in this interconnected\nWorld data leaks between people so the\ndata someone else shares can generate an\ninsight about you and it may be an\nInsight that you really don't want\nsomebody else to have or to use data\nownership is utterly meaningless it's\nwho the Insight refers to that\ncounts also defining data as public or\nprivate is also a challenge because\nanalytics can take public data like\nsocial media or web data\nto derive a private insight for example\nmodeling your daily habits in order to\npredict your physical\nlocation on the other hand analytics can\ntake private data such as your GPS\nlocation to generate a public Insight\nthat never exposes uniquely identifiable\ninformation so what do we do in this new\nworld this new interconnected world\nwhere we're faced with privacy\nspaghetti there is no easy solution to\nprivacy and different scenarios require\ndifferent\napproaches however knowing what is\npossible with data\nanalytics the type of insights that we\ncan infer from the seemingly innocuous\nand how we can fill in missing data I\nbelieve a key challenge that we need to\naddress is one of\ntransparency in much the same way as\nconsumers have decided that it's\nsocially unacceptable to buy from\ncompanies that pollute the environment\nwe could choose as individuals and a\nsociety if we really want to engage with\norganizations that are not open and\ntransparent about how they are\ncollecting analyzing and using\ninformation about\nus and a culture of transparency could\nnot only give us access to these\ninsights but it could also then enable\nus to exercise appro appropriate\ncontrol so how would transparency work\nin the real world I'd like to share with\nyou a project I've been working on\nwithin IBM for the last couple of years\nso IBM has been using social and\ncollaboration Technologies since long\nbefore it was popular so we're sitting\non probably one of the largest and the\nlongest standing Enterprise social\nnetworks on the\nplanet our challenge is that on the one\nhand we've got an Engaged Active network\nof employees who are all looking to\nmaximize the benefits that they get from\ntheir social and collaboration\ninvestment and then we've got a\nmanagement team Keen to understand what\nthe network is saying about their\nemployees and the business as a\nwhole when I was asked to build a system\nthat would analyze our Enterprise Social\nNetwork I decided to take a privacy by\nDesign approach and before we wrote a\nline of code we defined the philosophy\nthat would guide our subsequent design\ndecisions it had three\nprinciples privacy and personal autonomy\nat the heart of every decision that we\nmake and everything we do will be our\ncommitment to openness and transparency\nwith our\nemployees Simplicity and ease of use all\nanalytics will be clearly described\nsimply presented and understandable to\nevery employee and personal empowerment\nknowledge is power and we will put\nactionable insight into the hands of all\nemployees so employees get access to\nthese new insights and they get to\nchoose\nif they want to share them with anyone\nelse management get access to aggregated\nanalysis that allows them to drill down\nto subsets of the network but not to a\nuniquely identifiable\nindividual while this approach may seem\nrestrictive and if some people thought I\nwas insane when I initially suggested it\nI can tell you because we're doing all\nthis analysis but we're not going to\nshow you but the upside has been really\nsignificant for us on a number of\ndifferent fronts so the first thing is\nby defining very simple principles that\ndon't require a law degree to\ndecipher we've demonstrated trust with\nour employees and we've built this\ntrusting relationship with our employees\nby being open and transparent with them\nwe've been able to generate dialogue and\ncompletely change the conversation\naround how to use and generate value out\nof Social and collaboration data which\nfor me has been one of the most\nrewarding parts of the project because\nI've seen employees who would be\nnaturally suspicious of such an analytic\nsystem not only proactively requesting\nto join but offering to share more\ndata and really engaging in the\nconversation the other thing as well is\nby putting employees in control of the\nanalytics we've demonstrated\nrespect and then this whole engagement\nrespect and Trust has meant that we can\ncreate new relationships with our\nemployees so corporate programs now have\naccess to new insights\nbut in a way that is they can access\nthem in a way that is respectful and\nsensitive to employees so just to\ndemonstrate an example of this um a few\nmonths ago an an advocacy program within\nIBM reached out to me and they wanted\naccess to the analytics that we\ngenerated when I explained that the an\nanalytics was Private to each employee\nand I couldn't share it they were\ninitially disappointed however when we\nlooked in more detail at what their\nprogram needed we recognized that we\ncould give them so much more than\nanalytics we could give them an\nopportunity to really engage and build\nrelationships with the ibmers they\nwanted to\nrecruit so our system could accurately\nmap the needs of our users with the\nneeds of their\nprogram but by reaching back to\nemployees first before we shared\nanything we not only demonstrated that\nthis program respected the employees and\ntheir privacy but we also ensured that\nthe recommendations that we gave only\nincluded ibms that really wanted to be\npart of the program so this team they\nbravely didn't look at privacy as a\nbarrier to Innovation instead they saw\nas an opportunity to innovate and I\nbelieve their program is better because\nof it so could this approach to\ntransparency or this culture of\ntransparency work in the external social\nsphere I personally believe it could and\nmore importantly I believe it\nshould um much as we have given our\nemployees access to the analytics and\ncontrol on the analytics that we\ngenerate about them why should a\nconsumer have less level of transparency\nfrom the services that they use I know\npersonally I would like to know what\nsort of assumptions my favorite retailer\nmight be making about me and what\nthey're doing with those\ninsights data analytics is going to be\nkey to our\nfuture and as a society and if we want\nSociety to really benefit positively we\nneed to take this journey\ntogether if we can Embrace privacy\ninstead of fight it and if instead of\nlooking for the easy solution we look\nfor the best solution for all\nparticipants then maybe we can avoid\nthis tug-of war between the citizen on\nthe one hand who doesn't want to be\ndigitally stalked and manipulated and\nthe organization on the other whose very\nsurvival may depend on its ability to\nharvest and generate value from this\ndata demonstrating openness and\ntransparency builds trust and it allows\nour users to engage more openly and more\nfreely with us and share more data and\nmore data means more value for them and\nfor us it's a virtuous\ncircle thank\nyou\n",
