  "text": "Google is one of the world's leading\nsoftware and Technology developers every\nyear Google introduces new technical\ndiscoveries and advancements that are\namazing and beneficial to people all\naround the world because more\nindividuals are using Cloud the Google\nCloud platform has experienced an\nincrease in utilization in recent years\na variety of Google cloud services for\nGlobal consumers have been introduced in\nresponse to the high demand of computing\nresources so on realizing the popularity\nand the need for learning about\nComputing resources of gcp I have\nbrought a new video of Simply learn on\nGoogle Cloud in-depth tutorial 2022 in\nthis video I'll take you through crucial\nGCB services and their indepth\nConcepts so without doing any further\nAdo let's get\nstarted but before diving deep into the\nconcepts we will first cover the basics\nstarting with understanding what is gcp\nfollowed by the gcp tutorial in which we\nwill explore gcp services\nand its\ninfrastructure then we will have a quick\ncomparison between JCP AWS and ashure\nalong with Hon experience with\ngcp then we will move on to gcp web\nhosting and then we will understand\nGoogle machine learning with proper\ndemonstration and at last we will look\ninto the essentials of Google Cloud\nplatform\nfundamentals and how to exactly prepare\nfor it by the end of this video I can\nassure you that all your gcp related\nConcepts would have been clear so for\nthis training with me I have a\nexperienced gcp specialist together\nwe'll walk you through the different\ncrucial gcp Keynotes so let's start with\nan exciting video on Google Cloud\nin-depth tutorial\n2022 before we begin make sure to\nsubscribe to our YouTube channel and hit\nthe Bell icon and never miss an update\nfrom Simply\ndone good morning and good evening\neveryone so welcome to this session on\nGoogle Cloud platform my name is AJ and\nI'm an instructor with simply learn and\nalso working as a big data and Cloud\narchitect for various clients across\nglobe in this session we learn about\nGoogle Cloud platform wherein we will\nlearn about what is cloud computing why\nGoogle Cloud platform what is gcp that\nis Google Cloud platform Google Cloud\nplat platform domains about a use case\nthat is ferero use case and also a quick\ndemo on using services from Google Cloud\nplatform so when we talk about Google\nCloud platform we also need to know what\nis cloud computing so cloud computing is\nthe use of hardware and software\ncomponents to deliver a service to a\nnetwork users can access these files and\napplications and services provided by a\ncloud Provider from any device that has\naccess to Internet in short cloud\ncomputing is a way where cloud provider\nprovides access to different services\nsuch as resources and when we talk about\nresources here we talk about Computing\nwe talk about memory we talk about\nprocessing power we talk about storage\nand we also talk about different\nServices which Cloud providers make\navailable for the users now that allows\nus for automatic software integration\nbackup and restoring data unlimited\nstorage capacity having a reliable use\nof different services and having a cost\nefficient solution now we know that\ncloud computing models there are\ndifferent service models so you have\nplatform as a service you have\ninfrastructure as a service and you have\nsoftware as a service and these are the\nprominent models which are offered by\ndifferent Cloud providers such as Google\nCloud such as Google you have Amazon you\nhave Azure and also some organizations\nbuild their own private clouds using\nopen source open stack let's focus more\non Google Cloud platform and what it has\nto offer and how it is gaining\npopularity in the market with different\norganizations\nwhich would want to work on a cloud\nplatform or which would want to work on\nan infrastructure which is modernized so\nwhen we talk about cloud computing this\nis one of the approach which\norganizations can take to\ninstantaneously benefit from\nmodernization using different Services\ndifferent platforms and also newer\nTechnologies for their various\nrequirements such as scal ility or\ndynamic businesses before we get into\nGoogle Cloud platform it is also good to\nunderstand where you can find some\nuseful resources about Google Cloud\nplatform and here you have a website\nwhich is from your Google Cloud so this\nis cloud\nacademy.com librarygoogle and here you\ncan create a free account now that would\ngive you just 7 days trial but that has\nlot of videos which talk about your\nGoogle Cloud platform and Essentials and\nit has various certification related\nvideos which you can access and then\nafter 7 days after you have tried you\ncan obviously go for a paid account\nwhere you can take detailed learning\nfrom here now this is your training\nLibrary which shows your different Cloud\nproviders such as Amazon Microsoft\nassure gcp and then you have various\nother top topics which are specifics to\norganization you can obviously look at\nthe pricing and you can also look at\nresources which will give you a good\nexperience in learning from these videos\nyou can also create a free account which\nI will walk you through later so you can\ncreate a free account on\ncloud.google.com now when I say free\naccount that basically means it allows\nyou to create an account and every user\nwho creates an account gets a $300 free\ncredit which can be used to practice\nbrush up your skills and also explore\nand learn about different Google Cloud\nproducts which are offered by Google now\ncoming back to our Google Cloud platform\nlet's understand why Google Cloud\nplatform so Google Cloud platform is\npopular for many reasons now let us see\nfew of most important reasons why it\nstands out\nwhen you talk about pricing pricing is\none of the significant factors that make\nGoogle Cloud Stand Out Among the other\nCloud\nproviders it offers a monthly pricing\nplan which is build according to monthly\nusage and when we talk about billing\nhere the billing can be in hours it can\nbe in minutes and it can also be in\nseconds there are different options when\nyou talk about your pricing which can be\nfound from your Google Cloud web page\nnow pricing could be based on preemptive\nmachines pricing could be based on\nreserved instances or reserved resources\nI'll show you the link where you can\nfind more details on pricing part of it\nso Google Cloud really has various\npricing options which help customers in\ntheir different requirements whether\nthey would go for any of the service\nmodels such as infrastructure as a\nservice platform as a service or even\nsoftware as a service one more\nattractive thing about Google Cloud\npricing is that it provides committed\nuse discounts for example under this\nscheme you can purchase a specific\namount of virtual CPU course and memory\nfor up to 57% Discount off regular\nprices if you commit usage for either\none or 3 years now this is just one\noption there are various such options\nwhich you can learn about from the\nGoogle Cloud's page and that really\nsuits different customers for their\ndifferent\nrequirements now when we talk about\nspeed we don't need to really challenge\nthis aspect when it comes to Google\nservices so Google provides its Google\ncloud and Google app customer speed up\nto 10 tabt because of its faster cable\nsystem there are different kind of\nmachines which can be used if you're\ntalking about computation if you're\ntalking about memory hungry applications\nor even storage intensive workloads all\nin all speed is one of the defining\ncharacteristics of Google cloud services\nthe cable has connections over us West\nCoast main cities in Japan and even\nmajor hubs in Asia this speed enhances\nperformances and leads to customer\nsatisfaction now when we talk about\ncustomers any or every customer would\nprefer to have low latency High\nthroughput Based Services they would\nwant to use higher speeds to process\ntheir data in as less time as possible\nGoogle provides a low latency Network\ninfrastructure in fact you can say that\nwhen you are using Google cloud services\nyou are using the services from the same\ninfrastructure which Google uses for its\npopular services such as Google Google\nsearch or even YouTube which is one of\nthe second largest repository which can\nbe accessed for videos now when we talk\nabout Big Data big data is data which is\nvery complex has lot of other\ncharacteristics such as your volume you\nhave velocity you have variety you have\nveracity validity volatility virality\nand so on so if an organization has is\nworking on Big Data Google Cloud can be\na better choice because Google has many\nInnovative tools for cloud warehousing\nfor example such as big query and even\nrealtime data processing tools such as\ndata flow big query is a data warehouse\nthat allows massive processing of data\nat high speeds basically working on your\nstructured data Google also has launched\nsome new machine learning from\nartificial intelligence to tools now\nthere are various other services which\nwe can which we can use from Google\nCloud platform but let's understand what\nis Google Cloud platform and what are\nsome of the services even the services\nwhich are not listed here can be found\nin your console from Google Cloud so\nwhat is Google Cloud platform gcp it is\na set of Cloud Computing Services\nprovided by Google that runs on the same\ninfrastructure as I mentioned that\nGoogle uses for its end user products\nlike YouTube Gmail and even Google\nsearch the various set of services\noffered by Google Cloud platform are so\nyou have Services which are specific to\nComputing requirements and again in\nComputing you have various different\noptions available you have machines\nwhich are compute optimized machines\nwhich are memory optimized machines\nwhich are storage optimized and also we\nhave certain machines such as PRM Tiff\nwhich basically means that you could get\na machine to work on at a far lesser\nprice than any other machine but when we\ntalk about preemptive these are the\nmachines which can be requested on\ndemand and they can be taken back by\nGoogle at any time you have networking\nrelated Services which can be very\nuseful when you are setting up your\napplications or your Services across\nGlobe you also have different Services\nwhich are specific to machine learning\nand organizations which would be\ninterested in working on machine\nlearning or artificial intelligence\nwould be really interested in using\nthese Services there are also innovative\nsolutions to work on big data and Big\nData related Technologies now when we\ntalk about Google Cloud platform domains\nso we can break down these Services into\nspecifics such as you have compute now\nthe compute service allows for computing\nand hosting the cloud now when you talk\nabout Computing here there are different\nservices such as app engine you have\ncompute engine you have kubernetes you\nhave Cloud functions and Cloud run when\nyou talk about storage and database so\nthe storage and database service allows\napplication to store media files backups\nor other fil like objects now various\nServices Under This are as follows you\nhave cloud storage Cloud SQL Cloud big\ntable for unstructured data you have\nCloud spanner cloud data store\npersistent discs and Cloud memory store\nwhen we talk about networking the\nnetworking service allows us to load\nbalance traffic across resources now as\nI mentioned earlier resources could be\nyour different resources which you would\nbe using from a cloud platform such as\nyour devices your instances memory\noptimized or CPU optimized instances or\nother resources creating DNS records and\nmuch more so various Services Under This\nare VPC that stands for virtual private\nCloud you have Cloud load balancing\nCloud armor Cloud CDN you have Cloud\ninterconnect DNS and network service TS\nwhen we talk about the big data service\nthis allows us to process and query big\ndata in Cloud now various Services under\nthese are as follows you have big query\ncloud cloud data proc Cloud composer\ncloud data lab cloud data prep Cloud Pub\nsub which is publish and subscribing\nsystem you have cloud data studio now\nyou also have the developer tools and\ndeveloper Tools service includes tools\nrelated to development of an application\nnow various Services under these are as\nfollows that is you have Cloud SDK\nsoftware development kit you have\ndeployment manager Cloud Source\nrepositories and Cloud test lab when we\ntalk about identity and security which\nis one of the primary concerns for any\norganization or any user who would be\ninterested in using a cloud platform\nGoogle Cloud really has taken care of\nthis so when you talk about identity and\nsecurity domain this deals with Security\nServices now various Services here are\nCloud identity you have identity and\naccess management that is cloud am you\nhave identity aware proxies you have\ncloud data loss prevention API security\nkey enforcement Key Management Service\nand many more you also have cloud\nservices which are related to internet\nof things so very much would be used by\norganizations who would be working on\niot devices or the data generated by\nthese devices so various Services here\nare Cloud iot Core you have Edge TPU and\nCloud iot also when we talk about Cloud\nAI that is artificial intelligence this\ncomprises of services related to machine\nlearning and much more so you have Cloud\nAuto ml Cloud TPU Cloud machine learning\nengine job Discovery dialog workflow\nEnterprise natural language Cloud text\nto speech and much more if you would be\ninterested in Services related to API\nplatform then there are different\nServices Under This category or this\ndomain so you have Maps platform you\nhave APG API platform\nmonetization developer portal analytics\nthat is API analytics APG sense Cloud\nendpoints and service infrastructure so\nthese are some of the listing of\nservices under each Cloud platform\ndomain now let's look at Ferrero use\ncase and let's also understand what was\ndone here so ferero is one of the famous\nchocolate and ranks third among\nworldwide chocolate and confectionary\nproducers it was found in 1946 in Italy\nI'm sure you would have seen the ferero\nchocolates when you would have gone now\nto buy some chocolates so the challenges\nhere was that ferero as we know is sold\nin every supermarket and is known for\nits quality once the business grew some\nissues arous right and that's what\nhappens when the business grows you have\nissues popping up which could be related\nto the volume of data the speed with\nwhich the data is getting generated the\nvariety of data and also looking at your\nplatforms which support different\nDynamics applications or your\nscalability requirements performance\nrequirements and so on so it needed data\nstorage processing and Analysis system\nfor a wide customer\ndatabase there was a huge gap between\nthe company and the people who bought\nits goods because the company relied on\ndata given sales outlets now that's one\nof the challenge ferero wanted to create\na digital ecosystem where there was a\npoint of contact with its customer\nand also a foundation for an Innovative\ndatadriven marketing strategy what was\nthe solution here so one of the service\nof cloud platforms or Google Cloud\nplatform is Big query and this was an\nanswer to fero's challenges since it was\ncapable of hyper fast and efficient data\nanalysis as a solution now as I\nmentioned big query is a data warehouse\nwhich allows you to store structured\ndata now this could directly be used as\na service where you could store in any\namount of data and you would not be\npaying for storage so there are\ndifferent pricing models and for data up\nto 1 terabytes you would not be charged\nanything and if you would be accessing\nthe data that is reading the data or\nprocessing the data from bigquery that's\nwhere the pricing model kicks in now\nusing Google Cloud's big query business\nanalysts of ferero were able to store\nand analyze massive data sets in a very\nreliable fast and affordable\nmanner consumer behavior and sales\npattern data reports were easy to build\nand\nautomate and the analysis also followed\nferero to adopt advertising across\nvarious marketing channels to serve the\ncustomer needs in a better way what was\nthe result they could divide their\ndatabase into realtime actionable\nconsumer clusters to generate more\naccurate user profiles fero was also\nable to personalize its marketing\nstrategies to match the user needs now\nGoogle Cloud platform completely\ntailored the website mobile content and\nadvertising and created a very\ncosteffective media bu strategy now\nthese were some Basics on Google Cloud\nnow as I said you can always find lot of\ndetails about pricing about services and\nalso all the services are accessible in\nyour free trial account now let me just\nwalk you through here so one is you\ncould always find details on\ndocumentation on each of these services\nso if I would click on getting started\nyou have quick start which basically\nshows you short tutorials you have train\ntrain ings and you have also\ncertifications now if we click on quick\nstart now that takes me to this page\nwhich shows me quick starts or if you\nwould want to understand about different\nprojects if you would want to look into\nthe documentation of creating a Linux\nvirtual machine or storing a file and\nsharing it deploying a container Docker\ncontainer image and so on so you have a\nlot of quick starts here you can also\nlook at Cloud minute\non the same page on the right side you\nhave docs and once you click on that it\ntakes you to these links now this shows\nyou build Solutions which shows you top\nuse cases best practices all the\nsolutions it's always good to learn from\nthese use cases which are available and\nhere you have different feature products\nand all the different Services which\nGoogle Cloud offers now you can click on\nfeatured products and that basically\nshows you a list of these products now\nhere we have all the solutions which you\ncan look at architecture database\nEnterprise level big data and Analysis\ngaming related internet of things and so\non now if you go down here it shows you\nfeatured products and that shows you\nsome of the important products such as\ncompute engine which is belonging to the\ncompute domain you have Cloud run you\nhave anthers which is for migration and\nbasically cloud\nadoption when organizations would want\nto move from on premise to cloud-based\nSolutions you have Vision AI you have\ncloud storage now that basically allows\nyou to store any kind of data whether\nthat's an object so this is acting as an\nobject storage you have cloudsql which\nis basically a ready to use service\nwhere you would be using MySQL postr or\nany other SQL Server database Services\nyou have big query which is a data\nwarehouse which B basically allows you\nto store your structured data and then\nyou have your AI and machine learning\nrelated products so you have automl\nVision AI video AI text to speech speech\nto text and so on now you also have\ndifferent platform accelerators which\ncan be used and in any of these cases\nfor example if I would click on compute\nengine which is a featured product from\nGoogle Cloud now that shows you\nbasically your quick starts using your\nLinux machines how to guides which tells\nyou completely working on a VM instance\nor working on storage working on\npersistent disks and so on and it shows\nyou the documentation here now you also\nhave products and pricing option which\nyou can see for GCB pricing and you\ncould straight away go to the pricing\nyou could be looking at Solutions which\ntalks about infrastructure modernization\nnow this is something which\norganizations are interested in when\nthey would want to move from their on\npremise solution to your Google Cloud\nnow here I can say for example I click\non infrastructure modernization you can\nalways find some case studies what are\nthe different solutions we have here\nright when you talk about Google Cloud\nso you can always click on see Solutions\nand you can look at VM migration or SCP\nCloud right by Google Cloud what it can\nbe used for VMware as a service or HBC\nthat is high performance Computing and\nabout these Services we will learn in\ndetail later now I can go back on the\nsame page where I was clicking on the\nservices so you have quick starts you\nhave how to guides you have deep\nunderstanding of different concepts\nright and here if I click on all how to\nguides so that shows me what are the\ndifferent ways in which you can work\nwith Compu compute engine and working\nwith different instances although it's\nquite exhaustive content but then if you\nfollow steadily then you can learn a lot\nabout Google Cloud now here I can just\ngo back so this is just giving you some\nidea on the different products which are\navailable from Google Cloud looking into\ndifferent sections finding right\ndocumentation here right and you can\nalways look into each one of these in\ndetail for each product which Google\nCloud\noffers now if we scroll down we could\nsee all the options or all the domains\nwhich we see here right let me just go\nback because we got into Solutions now\nwe have quick starts right and then you\ncan basically scroll all the way down to\nlook at Cloud SDK which can be set up on\nyour Windows machine like I have set it\nup on my Windows machine plus when you\nuse Google cons console you have a GUI\nwhich I'll show you in a couple of\nminutes and also a cloud shell where you\ncan use your command line options to\nwork with Google Cloud platform you have\nCloud console which is nothing but your\nGUI to access your resources now you can\nalso look at in-depth tutorials pricing\nand you have different other options so\nlet's just click on pricing here and\nthen we have your PR price list which\nbasically gives you details of different\nServices what are available and what are\nthe services or what are the prices so\nfor example if I click on compute engine\nright and this shows me the pricing\naspect of compute engine which belongs\nto compute domain and here you can see\nyou have VM instance pricing you have\nnetworking pricing Soul tenant nodes\nwhich are specific to particular\norganizations or if organizations would\nwant to have DED ated notes you have GPU\nbased pricing right so General\nprocessing units you have dis and image\npricing and you can click on any of the\nlinks and you can see pricing which also\nshows you your different kind of machine\ntypes so here you have different kind of\nmachine types which says N1 N2 n2d E2\nyou have memory optimized machine types\nyou have compute optimized you have\npremium images and you can basically\nlook at all the categories you can look\nat DIS pricing which involves\nyour persistent dis pricing for ssds or\nsdds what are the kind of images what\nare the different network Services right\nand you can always look at your machine\ntypes you can choose a particular region\nright there is the concept of region and\navailability zones here and as per\nregion you could look at the prices you\ncan also look at standard prices you\ncould be looking for what are the free\ntier machines if I'm specifically\nlooking for VM instance pricing I can\nclick on this one and that takes me to\nthe VM instance pricing what is the\nbuilding module what is the instance up\ntime what is the resource based pricing\nand then you can also look at different\nkind of discounts such as sustained use\ndiscounts committed use discounts\ndiscounts for preemptable FM instances\nand so on and this is how you can be\nlooking at pricing for all different\nresources and you can choose the\nresource which you are interested in\nand then look for the pricing\nbenchmarks reservations if you would\nwant to use and you would want to\nbenefit if you would want to look at\nwhat are the quotas and limits and so on\nso please explore this link and you can\nfind lot of information when it comes to\ntechnical options looking at different\nGoogle Cloud products which we briefly\ndiscussed when it comes to domains and\nwhat each product can be used for you\ncan always come back to the main page\nwhere I was showing you different\nServices we went into pricing straight\naway right now you can always come back\nto this page on your cloud.google.com\nand then you have your\nSolutions which talks about different\nproducts right and you can click on\nthese or you can look into technical\ndocumentation so this talks about your\ndifferent featured Solutions\ninfrastructure Solutions you have data\ncenter migration related and so on so I\ncould be talking more and more about\nGoogle Cloud platform platform it's a\nocean it's a huge chunk of different\nservices for different organizational\nrequirements so look into this link and\nalso what you can do is create a account\non Gmail I mean you could create a free\naccount or you could go to\ncloud.google.com\nand then you could create a free account\nlike I have created here and I can just\nclick on Console now that's my GUI or\nGoogle Cloud console\nwhich basically allows me to work with\nGoogle Cloud now there are a lot of\noptions here by default when you create\nan account now in my case on the top it\nsays it's a free trial account I have\n$300 credit and out of that $251 is left\nand 237 days out of a year are left for\nmy account now here I can basically see\nthe project right and by default we can\ncreate an project or by default there is\na project existing for any user so when\nyou log in it creates a particular\nproject and you could create a new\nproject and project would be to dedicate\nyour different services or different\nresources per different project so this\nis your dashboard which basically shows\nyou your project which shows you a\nproject number and a project ID which is\nalways unique now you can click on this\nand this if you would want you can hide\nthis information you can also look into\nthe documentation part of of it then it\nshows you the different services or a\ngraphical information of services which\nyou might have used in past so you have\ncompute engine which shows you how much\npercentage of CPU was used you can\nalways go to compute engine as a service\nyou can look at your Google Cloud\nplatform status and look at the Google\nCloud status now this is billing now\nsince this shows me the billing period\nfor April month and I can always look at\ndetailed charges I can look at reporting\nI can look at different apis which\nGoogle offers and you for your different\nkind of work you can always go to the\nAPI overview or the API link and enable\nor disable any API now once you enable\nor disable any API then you can use that\nso you have news section you have\ndocumentation and you have getting\nstarted guides which tells you how to\nwork or enable different apis if you\nwould want to deploy a pre-build\nsolution at Dynamic logging monitoring\nerrors deploying a Hello World app and\nso on now this is your dashboard I can\nclick on activity and that would show me\nwhat kind of activity I would have done\nin my cloud platform I can always choose\nthe kind of activities by saying\nactivity type I can choose the resources\nnow it shows me that I created some VM\ninstances I deleted them I up updated\nsome metadata I basically worked on\ninstances I changed some firewall rules\nhere I have then also worked on some\nother services or apis so I created some\nbuckets which is for object storage and\nagain I have been working with some\ninstances and creating some firewall\nrules here I have granted some\npermissions I am setting up a policy\nright so this activity gives me a\nhistory of what things I have done over\nthe past couple of months while working\non Google Cloud platform now on the top\nleft corner you have the hamburger menu\nwhich you can click on this so that's\nyour navigation menu and when you click\non this this shows you home it takes you\nto the marketplace it specifically takes\nyou to billing you can always look at\napis and services so here in API\nServices I can pretty much go to a\ndashboard and I can see report on the\ntraffic or errors or latency and the\nkind of apis which are available so you\nhave compute engine API you have big\nquery API big query data transfer API\nbig query storage cloud data proc so\nthese are some of the apis or Services\nI've used in past might be I was\nevaluating a product might be I was\nusing a particular product so you have\nwhenever you would want to use a\nparticular service from Google Cloud\nplatform you would be en enabling these\napis so here we see some apis for data\nproc you have logging monitoring you\nhave resource manager API you have\ncloudsql which allows you to directly\nuse MySQL or postgress you have cloud\nstorage right and so many apis so if I\nwould want to enable a particular API\nwhich is not right now required but then\nit's good to know you can always click\non this one you can search for an API so\nfor example if if I would say data proc\nright and that shows me the cloud data\nproc API which manages Hadoop based\nclusters and jobs on Google Cloud\nplatform so I can spin up a Hadoop\ncluster and I can start running some\njobs on a Hadoop cluster on demand and\nas I'm done with it I can just get rid\nof it so this is an API which I would\nhave to enable and then for every\nparticular service you also have an\nadmin API which you would enable now\ngoing back so com out from this API\nLibrary I got into API and services now\nthere is you can look into the library\nyou can look at credentials and you can\nalso look at different time intervals\nfor which you can see the usage of your\ndifferent apis now going back to the\nmenu you have support wherein you can\nalways reach out to the Google support\nteam if you are using a paid version\neven with free trial you can try to\nreach out and you will find someone want\nto help but it is always good when you\nhave a billing cycle reaching out the\ncustomer care you have identity access\nmanagement in admin and this is required\nwhen you're working with different apis\nor Services when you would want to have\nrelevant access you have getting started\nyou have security related options you\nhave anthos which is mainly for\nmigration now here you can look at your\ndifferent domains such as which we\ndiscussed so you have compute and in\ncompute you you have different services\nso you have app engine you have compute\nengine kubernetes you have Cloud\nfunctions and Cloud run you can look\ninto the storage aspect which shows you\nbig table which is usually and mainly\nfor your unstructured data big table\nwhich is something which gave rise to\npopular nosql databases like hbas and\ncassendra you have data store which can\nbe used you have fire store file store\nstorage which can be used to put in data\nof any kinds you have SQL for structured\ndata you have spanner as a service you\nhave memory store and you have data\ntransfer now when it comes to the\nnetworking domain you have all these\nservices such as VPC virtual private\nnetwork network related services for\nyour load balancing for using a\ncloud-based DNS or Cloud defined Network\nyou have hybrid connectivity network\nservice tis security and intelligence\nthen you have have other options for\nyour operations which can be used and\nhere you have different other tools\nwhich can be used such as Cloud build\nyou have Cloud tasks container registry\ndeployment manager and many more big\ndata specific you have the services here\nso you have data proc which can be used\nto spin up your clusters you have\npublish subscribe messaging system such\nas now cka which you might have heard of\noriginates its idea from here so Pub sub\nyou have data flow you have iot core big\nquery which is a data warehouse package\nor data warehousing solution from Google\nCloud now then you have your artificial\nintelligence related services and other\nGoogle Solutions so you can always find\na huge list of services or you can say\nat high level Solutions offered by\nGoogle cloud and we can use these to\nbasically test some of the solutions use\nthem and work on them so I'll give you a\nquick demo on different Services which\ncan be used here from your Google Cloud\nplatform now this is your Google Cloud\nplatform and this is your console now\nthis also gives you a cloud shell which\ncan be activated so that you can work\nfrom command line and you can always\nfind lot of documentation on that so you\ncan also set up your Cloud shell that is\nSDK on your Windows machine and if you\nhave set it up then basically you could\nbe doing something like gcloud right if\nthe cloud has been set up so in my case\nI had set up the cloud SDK and basically\nI can get into that by looking at what\npath I have set up so Cloud SDK and then\nI can be using it from my Windows\nmachine as per my comfort I can also\nactivate the cloud shell here which will\nbasically open up a terminal and at any\npoint of time you can open up this one\nCloud shell in a different window it is\npreparing the cloud shell where it will\nby default set up your project it will\nset up the meta data and now I am logged\ninto my Google Cloud account from\ncommand line and here I can basically\nuse gcloud right and that basically\nshows you the different options which\nare available which you can be using so\nif you would want to use a particular\nservice you can also try giving a help\nand that shows you how do you manage\nyour Google Cloud platform right so you\nhave different options for billing to\nwork with your different services and\nbasically you could be working on Google\nCloud using this Cloud shell from your\ncommand line usually for people who are\nlearning Google cloud in the beginning\nit is always good to go for console and\nuse your different services from here in\nan easier way but as I said you can\nalways use the command line for example\nif I would just go ahead and type\ngcloud create\ninstances and that will directly take me\nto the cloud console documentation which\nshows you different options which you\ncan use to work with instances so I\ncould do a g-cloud compute instances\ncreate and then I can give my instance\nname and so on and I'll show you some\nexamples on that so you can be using\nyour Cloud console right that is your\nCloud shell and you can straight away\nstart working from command line however\nI would suggest using console in the\nbeginning and when you are well\nexperienced then you can start using\nCloud shell to do things from command\nline and when you are fully experienced\nyou can always switch and certain things\nare usually useful or easier when done\nfrom command line and some are easier\nwhen you do it from the console and you\ncan use any one of these options now we\ncan go to Google Cloud console now as of\nnow I can close this one I still have my\ncloud shell open if I would want to look\ninto it I can click on this one and I\ncan straight away go to compute engine\nwhere I would want to work on creating\nsome instances on Google Cloud platform\nusing the compute engine service and\nthen basically connecting to those\ninstances and basically trying out some\nbasic things so you can click on VM\ninstances and then once this comes up I\ncan always create some instances now if\nyou see here I have some in instances\nalready created right and I can continue\nworking on those I can create new\ninstances I can use different options\nwhile creating instances and I'll show\nyou that in a demo in quick seconds so\nlet's have a quick demo on setting up\ngcp instances now before that let's have\na quick recap so when you talk about\ninstance or a virtual machine it is\nhosted on Google's infrastructure right\nand you can create your Google Cloud\ninstance using this Google Cloud console\nthat is by clicking on this and then\ngoing to computer engine and clicking on\nVM instances now you can also do that\nfrom Google Cloud command line tool that\nis cloud shell and you can be doing that\nusing compute engine API so compute\nengine instances can run the public\nimages for Linux or Windows servers that\nGoogle provides you also have option of\ncreating or using custom images that you\ncan create an import from your existing\nsystems you can deploy Docker containers\nwhich are automatically launched on\ninstance running containers optimized OS\nnow when you talk about instances and\nprojects always remember that in each\ninstance belongs to a Google Cloud\nconsole project and a project can have\none or more instances when you talk\nabout instances and storage options each\ninstance has a small boot persistent dis\nwhich I will show you in further screens\nthat contains the OS you can add more\nstorage space if needed and when you\ntalk about instances and network a\nproject can have up to five VPC networks\nso VPC network is virtual private\nnetworks wherein you can virtual private\nCloud networks where you can have your\nresources within your own subnet and\neach instance belongs to one VPC Network\nnow instances in same network can\ncommunicate with each other through\nlocal area network protocol an instance\nuses internet to communicate within any\nmachine so that could be virtual\nphysical or outside its own network when\nyou talk about instances and containers\nyou should remember that compute engine\ninstances support a declarative method\nfor launching your applic ation using\ncontainers now you can create a VM\ninstance or a VM instance template you\ncan provide a Docker image and launch\nthe configuration so there are different\nways in which you can create these\ninstances and once you create these\ninstances you can say for example you're\ncreating a Linux instance you can\nassociate SSH keys with your Google\naccount or your G Suite account and then\nmanage your admin non-admin access to\nthe in instance using IM roles if you\nconnect to your instance using gcloud or\nSSH from console which we will see later\ncompute engine can generate SSH keys for\nyou and apply that to your Google cloud\nor G Suite account now what we can do is\nwe can see how we can create your Google\nCloud instances from your console or\nfrom the command line let's have a look\nin creating instances using gcp console\nnow that we have learned on some basics\nof Google Cloud platform what are the\ndifferent Services what are different\ndomains basically looking at your Google\nCloud console or even Cloud Shell let's\ngo ahead and create some VM instances\nnow that's from your compute engine\nservice and let's try connecting to\nthese instances and see how this works\nlet's also see what are the different\noptions which are available when you\nwould want to create create the virtual\nmachine instances here so when you click\non your drop- down from the top left and\nchoose compute engine so it brings you\nto this page so I can show that again so\nyou can click on compute engine click on\nVM instances and that basically brings\nyou to this page now here it tells you\ncompute engine lets you use Virtual\nmachines that run on Google's\ninfrastructure so we can create micro\nVMS or large instances running different\ndistributions of L Linux or Windows\nusing standard images that is public\nimages and you can also have your own\nimage so let's create AVM instance by\nclicking on create now that's basically\nhelping me to create an instance here so\nit shows me the instance name I can give\nit something so let me say C1 now I can\nadd labels so what is label it basically\nallows you to organize your project add\narbitrary labels as key value pairs to\nyour resource so this so this is\nbasically categorizing your labels and\nprojects if you have multiple projects\nnow remember if you have your Cloud\nconsole and if you have created your\nfree trial account it will allow you to\ndo these things if not you may have to\ngo back to the billing section and see\nif the billing is enabled which also\nmeans that when you are creating your\nGoogle Cloud account it will ask you to\nke your credit card details but they do\nnot charge anything or they might charge\nmight be $1 or one rupee depending on\nyour location and that's also refunded\nbut that's just to verify your card now\nonce I've given the name I can choose a\nregion so I would basically choose\nEurope since I'm in Europe I would be\nclicking on Europe West 3 and here I can\nchoose an availability Zone availability\nzone is basically to make your services\nor instances or any other resources\nhighly available so you can choose one\nof the availability zones now I would\nchoose save as 3 now this one we can\nscroll down and here it says machine\nconfigurations you have general purpose\nmachines you have memory optimized\nmachines which is M1 series and you can\nalways go back to the Google Cloud page\nand see what a particular kind of\nmachine specializes in so I would click\non general purpose and in general\npurpose you have different categories so\nyou have N1 which is powered by Intel\nSkylake CPU platform or you have E2\nwhich is CPU platform selected selection\nbased on availability so let's have N1\nselected now this one shows me the\nmachine type and if you are using your\nfree tier account then you can start\nwith correcting a micro machine which is\none virtual CPU core you can go for a G1\nsmall which is one virtual CPU core and\n1.7 GB Ram you can even go up to a\nhigh-end machine and then you can\nbasically see if you're using a free\naccount count how many of these machines\nyou can use if I would be selecting\neight virtual CPU CES and 32 gab of\nmemory then it would allow me to create\nat least two instances by this\nconfiguration we will use N1 standard\nwhich is one virtual CPU core 3.75 GB\nmemory now then we can also deploy a\ncontainer image to this VM instance if\nyou would be interested in deploying a\ncontainer image let's not get into that\nright now here it shows shows you the\nboot dis and it shows you dbn gnu 9\nLinux 9 what I would do is I can go for\nthis distribution or I can choose a\nLinux distribution of my choice so here\nyou have public images you have custom\nimages you also have snapshots if you\nhave created backup of your previous\nimages here I can choose for example\nUbuntu and then I can choose a\nparticular version so let's go for to\n18.04 you can go for the latest one also\n18.04 would be good enough and here it\ntells me what is the boot dis so you\nhave ssds or you have standard\npersistent discs now ssds are little\nexpensive in comparison to your standard\npersistent discs or your sdds but then\nssds are faster so as of now we can\nchoose standard persistent disk as it is\nand we can let the gigabyte be 10 now\ndepending on your requirement you can\nincrease this you can even add diss\nlater that's not a problem click on\nselect now here I have access Scopes so\nhere I will say allow default access you\ncan also set access for each API or you\ncan give full access to all Cloud apis\nso that based on your requirement you\ncan anytime change later also we will\nalso say allow sttp traffic and we can\nalso choose allow https traffic that\nbasically allows me to access access\nthis machine or Services which are HTTP\nbased accessible from this machine now I\ncan just click on create however it\nwould be good to basically enable\nconnectivity to this machine now we can\ndo that in different ways one is when\nyou bring up your machine it will have\nan SSH access which you can log in from\nthe cloud platform here itself or what\nyou can do is you can create a private\nand a public key using some softwares\nlike puty or puty gen so for example if\nyou do not have that on your machine you\ncan download you can just type in\ndownload puty that takes you to the\np.org page and here you can click on\ndownload puty and scroll down which\nshows you for your 64-bit machine which\nI have in my case you can download\nputty.exe which is basically your SSH\nintet client to connect to your machines\nyou can also use puty gen which will be\nallowing you to create a private and a\npublic key which I have done in my case\nlet me show you how so what you can do\nis you can go to puty gen to begin with\nand here you can click on generate now\nthen to have this key generated just\nmove your cursor on the top here in the\nempty space and that creates your key\nyou can give it a name so for example\nlet's give a username I would give hdu\nnow I can give a password for this one\nso let me give a simple password\nand what I can also do is I can copy\nthis public key from here and for my\nlater usage I can just keep it in my\nnotepad file which I can use later and\nI'll show you when so now we can save\nthis private key and this will basically\nallow me to save my private key I can\nchoose desktop and I can give it a name\nso let's say new key new key and that\nwill be getting saved in a DOT PPK file\nso let's save it and that's done so we\nalso have our public key and we have\nsaved our private key now we know that\nwhen you would want to connect using SSH\nyou need your private keys to the client\nand public key also has to be existing\nso let's take this public key so let's\ndo a contr a I'm going to copy this and\nI'm going to come back to my Google\nCloud console and here you can click on\nsecurity so you can click on the\nsecurity tab here here scroll down and\njust give your a public key once you\ngive that it resolves and shows you the\nname and this is good enough so that I\ncan use my SSH client to connect to this\nmachine I can click on Create and this\nwill basically create my VM instance it\nwill take some time and then your\ninstance will have an internal IP which\nwill show up here external IP and it\nwill also show you options to connect to\nthese machines so this is my internal IP\nthis is my external IP which I can use\nto connect from a client I can easily\nconnect from the option here which says\nSSH and I can say open in a browser\nwindow I can even open this in a custom\nPort I can look at the g-cloud command\nwhich you can give from cloud shell or\nyou can use another SSH so let's first\ndo a open in browser window and let's\nsee if this connects so we can easily\nconnect to our instance the u 2 18\ninstance which I just set up here easily\nin couple of seconds now this is trying\nto establish a connection using your SSH\nkeys and when you do that it also\nbasically brings up this web browser so\nI'm already connected it shows my user\nname which is my cloud account username\nand I have been connected to this\nmachine here using SSH it did not ask me\nfor a new password and basically now I\ncan just check what do I have in my\nLinux file system right and I can\nanytime log in as root by doing a Pudo\nSu for example let's try installing a\npackage and I can say apt get install\nwhm or apt get install WG get or apt get\ninstall open SSH and all these packages\nare already existing so not an issue now\nI can start using this instance I can\njust look at the disk what is available\nokay now we gave around 10 GB out of\nwhich we see 8.3 GB here for the dev SDA\n1 and then 1.8 GB available and you can\ncontinue using this machine this was the\neasiest way of connecting to a VM\ninstance using\nSSH now what we can also do is I can\njust leave this and I will now try to\nconnect using an external SSH client\nright and here you can copy the public\nIP so when you want to connect to an\ninstance you will have to get the public\nIP also remember that if you select and\nstop this machine which will stop your\nbilling counter and if you start it\nagain the internal IP will remain same\nbut the external IP is the one which\nwill change I can obviously select this\nmachine anytime and I can do a cleanup\nand I can delete it I can do a start of\nthe machine if it is stopped and I can\neven import the virtual machine to be\nused later so there are different\noptions which you can always use so this\nis my instance and if you would want to\nlook at the details click on this one C1\nand that should basically allow you to\nlook at the details so it shows you what\nis the instance ID what is the machine\ntype is it reservation specific what is\nthe CPU platform what's the zone and all\nthe other details at any point of time\nif you would want to edit you can always\nclick on edit and you can change the\ndetails as you need now you can also\nlook at the equivalent rest command to\nbasically use the rest API to connect to\nthis instance for now I have copied the\npublic IP and I would want to connect it\nusing puty so let's go in here and let's\ngive it the host name so I can give\nUbuntu I can give my IP address so\nthat's in my session now I will click on\nSSH I would go into authentication I'll\nclick on browse and this is where I need\nto choose the p PK file so this is the\none which we created new key let's\nselect this and then I can come back to\nsession I can even save this and I can\ncall it as my instance one let's save it\nand you can create any number of\ninstances so you see I have created\ndifferent instances here for my Google\ncloud or Amazon related instances and I\ncan click on open it says the servers\nhost key is not casted in the registry\nthat's fine just click on yes and\nbasically it says no authentication\nmethod supported now this could be\nbecause we have not enabled your SSH\naccess so let's look at that so now\nlet's see if we were trying to connect\nusing puty what was the issue here so if\nI go back to my puty select my instance\nload it it says Port 22 I'm giving the\nusername which is window or sorry that's\nthe wrong user user name we gave and\nthat might be the reason we had set up\nthe user as s duu so let's save this\nagain and now let's try connecting to\nthis one and it asks for my password and\nyou are able to connect this right now\nif there was any other issue related to\nnetwork connectivity then we could look\nat the rules the inbound and outbound\nrules which allow us to look into the\nmachine now we are connected to our\nmachine here using hdu user I can log in\nas root and I can continue working so\nnot only from the SSH within the cloud\nconsole but you can use an external SSH\nclient and connect to your machine so\nthis is your open to machine and we can\nbasically look at the space and that\nbasically confirms we are connecting to\nthe same machine which shows 8.3 GB here\nand 1.8 GB here which we were seeing\nfrom the ssh in the browser now let's\nclose this and let's go back to our\ninstance page now now here you can\nalways look at the network details and\nthis will show you your different kind\nof rules that is ingress or egress rules\nwhich basically allows to connect to\nthis machine from an external network or\nfor this machine to connect to an\nexternal network so here we have\ndifferent firewall rules which shows\ndefault allow HTTP that's your Ingress\nRule and it tells you apply to all it\nshows me what are the IP ranges where I\ncan specifically give the IP of my my\nmachine it shows the protocols it shows\nwhat are the different ports which you\nhave used for these services for example\nRDP or SSH which shows 22 you have icmp\nHTTP and https now anytime if you would\nwant to make a change to these rules\nthat can be done by going into your\nnetwork details and say for example you\nwould want to work on firewall rules so\nwe have these firewall rules here you\ncan click on this one so right now we\nare looking into the network domain and\nwe are looking into VPC Network right\nand this shows me what are the different\nrules we have now if I would want to\ncreate a different firewall rule for a\ndifferent protocol I can always click on\ncreate firewall rule I can give it a\nname okay I can say what if you would\nwant to turn all the firewall logs you\ncan basically say what is the kind of\ntraffic so Ingress applies to incoming\ntraffic and egress applies to outgoing\ntraffic and you can then basically\nchoose what are the IP ranges from where\nyou want that connection to be coming in\nor to going out you can choose a\nparticular protocol you can give a\nprotocol here with comma separated\nvalues and you can create a firewall\nrule so this might be required depending\non the services which you are running\nwherein you might want to enable your\naccess to your machine from an external\nservice or to an external service so you\ncan always go to network details from\nhere you can then go into firewall rules\ncreate a firewall rule apply that to\nyour instance and restart your instance\nso as of now we don't need to create any\nnetwork details here because my Ingress\nor egress rules are already available\nright now I can basically then have my\ninstance stopped and removed so I can\njust do a stop\nor since this is running the ideal wave\nwould be to do a stop I could also do a\nreset now what does reset do reset does\nnot basically delete the machine what it\ndoes is it does a cleanup of the machine\nand it brings it to the initial state so\nsometimes we might have installed\ncertain things on our machine we would\nwant to clean them up and at that time\nreset can be useful I can basically\nclick on delete right and I can select\nthis and I can do a cleanup and and this\nis good always when you are using a free\ntrial account try to use different\nServices play around with them and then\nyou can clean up so that you do not\nwaste your free billing credit right and\nyou can use it for Meaningful stuff now\nI have clicked on delete and within few\nseconds my instance which I had created\nwill be deleted also to remember is if\nyou are creating multiple instances then\nyou can connect from one machine to\nother machine using SSH by using the\nprivate file so for that we can learn in\ndetail later so this is just a simple\nexample of using your compute engine\ncreating your instances connecting to it\nfrom an internal SSH or from an external\nSSH client such as puty where you have\nalready created your private and public\nKeys now I can click on the browser here\nand then I can basically come out and I\ncan basically be looking into any\nparticular service so we just looked\ninto compute engine right you have\ndifferent other options you have\ninstance groups you have instance\ntemplates for example let's click on\ninstance templates here and that\nbasically shows you that you don't have\nany instance template and this basically\nfacilitates say for example you are\nworking as a admin and you would want to\ncreate an instance template so that\nusing that you can describe a VM\ninstance and then you can basically use\nthis template to create different\ninstances you can go for soul tenant\nnoes you can look for machine images you\ncan also look at your discs you can\ncreate a snapshots and you can look at\ndifferent options here now let's come\nback here and let's click on home and\nthat should take you back to your\nhomepage which basically shows you if a\nparticular API which you have used\nrecently which shows me in the graph\nhere so I can go to the api's overview\nright and that basically shows me if\nthere were any errors if I was using the\ncompute engine API to basically create a\nVM instance and that's why we were\nseeing some spike in the graph so this\nis a quick demo of using your compute\nengine service provided by Google Cloud\nwherein you can create VM instances and\nuse those VM instances for your\napplication installation for any other\npurpose now that we have seen how you\nuse your Cloud console to create an\ninstance and also clean it up let's also\nunderstand how you can do using your\ncommand line options and let's see what\nit takes or what are the different\ncommands which you can use to create\nyour\ninstances now you can always when when\nyou're creating an instance you can use\ncompute engine which provis resources to\nstart the instance so instance basically\nhas different states\nwhich we can see when we are creating\nthe instance so you basically start the\ninstance instance moves into staging\nthat is prepared for your first boot\nfinally it boots up and then it moves\ninto running so when you look at\ninstance states which we will create\ninstance and see it will basically have\ndifferent states such as provisioning\nwhere resources are being allocated for\ninstance but instance is not yet running\nthen it goes into state paging where\nresources have been acquired and\ninstance is being prepared for your\nfirst boot then instance is booting up\nand running and if you are stopping an\ninstance it goes into being stop status\nand it would be moved to the terminated\noption you can also do a repairing of\ninstance and finally you can terminate\nyour instance or clean it up by stopping\nand then deleting it now when you say\nstopping and resetting an instance you\ncan stop the instance as I showed\nearlier if you no longer need it but if\nyou need for future use you can just use\nthe reset option which will basically\nwipe the contents of instance or any\napplication State and then finally you\ncan stop it and have it terminated now\nwhen you would want to do that using\nyour Cloud console uh we have seen the\noptions now let's also see from the\ncommand line tool how you can do it so\nhere I I have the cloud shell which I\nbrought up from here and I basically\nopened it in a new window so command\nline tool enables you to easily manage\nyour compute engine resources in a\nfriendlier format than using your\ncompute engine API now g-cloud which is\npart of cloud SDK is the main command\nhere and then you can always\nautocomplete the different options here\nso when you would want to create or work\non gcloud you can just type in gcloud\nhere and then for example I could just\nsay help to see different options of\ng-cloud which will show me different\noptions which you can use here now we\nwould be interested in compute instances\nso I could also do a\ngcloud\ncompute compute instances and then I can\nbasically say create and then I can do a\nhelp now that should show me different\noptions options which work with gcloud\ncompute instances create command which\nis expecting an instance name so your\nGoogle Cloud SDK which we can set up on\nour Windows machine or even on your\nLinux machine is set of tools that helps\nyou to manage resources and applications\nhosted on your gcp that is your Google\nCloud platform now here you have options\nsuch as g-cloud which I'm showing you\nright now you have Gs util and and then\nyou have BQ so that also can be used so\nyou can set up a Google Cloud compute if\nusing gcloud now what we can do is if we\nare setting up our SDK on our Windows\nmachine then we would have to do a\ngcloud in it which basically initializes\nyour configurations for\ngcloud now here we are using a cloud\nshell which was started from the console\nand we don't have to basically give your\ng-cloud init command because it's\nalready initialized now you can always\nlook at your default Zone you can look\nat your region what is being used all\nthose things are coming from the\nmetadata which is being used so for\nexample I could be looking at the\nmetadata for my particular project by\njust doing a\ngcloud and then I can say Compu\nand I would be interested in Project\ninfo so I can just do a project minus\ninfo and then I can do a describe and\nthen I need my project ID so I can say\nminus minus project and I can get my\nproject ID from here so you can click on\nthis one and that's my project ID so I\ncan click on this one and here I can\njust do a right click and if it does not\npaste then you can do a control V and\nthen I can try to look at my project\ninfo so this basically will give me the\nmetadata which is by default set and we\ncan always look at what are the regions\nor what is the Zone which has been set\nso if it has been set so I'm looking at\nmy details it is showing me my SSH keys\nand then it can be using your default\nregion and your default available zones\nit also shows my username and other\ndetails so this is basically to look at\nthe metadata which is available now at\nany point of time I can basically say\nadd metadata I can basically choose\nmetadata option and I can say my default\nregion should be Europe which I was\nchoosing earlier so I can just bring up\nthis command again and what I can do is\nI can say here where I have gcloud\ncompute project info where I did a\ndescribe earlier now what I can also do\nis I can just say add\nmetadata and then I can specify what is\nthe metadata I would be interested in\nadding I can then say Google\ncompute\ndefault region and then I can basically\ngive a region for example Europe and\nthen I can say West\n3 and if you are not well experienced\nyou can always do it from console or you\ncan be doing it from here so I'm giving\nGoogle Cloud compute Google compute\ndefault region then I can also give a\nGoogle compute default\nZone and then I can pass in a value for\ndefault zone so I can say Europe West 3\nand then basically I can give an\navailability zone so if it is basically\ngiving me some error where I'm trying to\npass in these values so I can just give\nit this way and then it basically says\nthat if you can look into particular\nhelp to see what is the command which\nyou would have to do now I can basically\ndo a\ngcloud init here initial configuration\nand this basically says that it is\ninitializing my default configuration it\nsays reinitialize this configuration\nfrom cloud shell you want to create a\nnew configuration so if if I had updated\nmy metadata then basically I could just\ndo a cloud in it and I could be\nreinitializing my default configuration\nor properties which I have passed in so\nas of now I will not activate or change\nthe default region let's go for a simple\nway in which you can create your compute\nengine so for example I'll just say one\nand it is reinitializing it asks me what\nis the username and let's select that it\nsays what is the project and let's\nselect that and do you want to configure\na default compute region and zone right\nand I will just say Yes And basically\nthen it shows me different options which\nwe have here so there are too many\noptions here and then here we were\ninterested in Europe West 3 so let's\nchoose 21 right and then that basically\nAl allows me to choose my region and my\nzone so it also gives you some\nspecifications so it says your project\ndefault compute Zone has been set to\nEurope West 3A you can change it by\nrunning g-cloud config set and you can\ngive a compute zone right so I can\nalways give these commands I can get\nhelp information here so I can just say\ngcloud config set and I can be\nspecifying the computer zone so I can\nsay compute SL Zone and I can give a\nZone I can say compute SL region and I\ncan give a region name if I would want\nto do it or the easier ways like what I\ndid right now so you can basically do a\ncommand gcloud in it and then basically\nit allows you to change your\nconfiguration or set default things here\nyou can all the times you can say gcloud\nconfig unset to basically remove a\ncomputer\nzone or a compute region now there are\ndifferent ways so if you were working on\na Linux machine you could always use an\nexport command something like this so\nyou could do export compute sorry Cloud\nSDK and then you can say\ncomputor Zone and then give your Zone\nname or compute _ region and give you\nyour region or you could add it in your\nbash RC file right now that is when you\nhave your Cloud SDK set up on your Linux\nmachine or on Windows machine and you\nwould want to specifically set a Zone\nand a region for all your compute\nrelated resources so we don't need to do\nthat the default settings are already\ngiven here right and what we can do is\nwe can start by quickly looking into\ngcloud compute instances options so I\ncan say g-cloud compute instances this\nand then I can just do a list at any\npoint of time if you would need help you\ncan just do a g-cloud compute and then\nsay minus minus help or I could just do\na g-cloud compute and that shows me\ndifferent options which I have here from\nwhich I use instances I can always type\ninstances and again hit enter and it\nshows me different options what you\nwould want to do so I can initially just\ntype list which should show me what are\nthe list or what are the instances\navailable and as of now we don't have\nany instances I can always do a list and\nthen I can specify minus minus format\nand then try to get the information in a\nJson format or EML or minus minus format\ntext so you can always do a list you can\ndo a filter so there are different\noptions with your list and you can you\ncan try doing a help here and that\nbasically shows you what are the options\nso for example if I do a help and it\nshows me with list what are the things\nyou can do so you can give a name you\ncan give a regular expression you can\nsay in particular Zone you can use a\nminus filter so there are different\ncommands which are available and you can\nalways find all those options here as I\nshowed you earlier so now what we would\nbe interested in is basically going for\nyour compute instances I can always do a\nSSH and I can create an instance I can\nadd and remove metadata right for my\ninstances by giving a particular Zone by\ngiving a particular region and if you\nwould want to do that now here what we\ncan do is we can basically create an\ninstance by just giving a name to that\nparticular instance and we can then go\nback to our console and see what has it\ndone so I can say here create so that's\nan option let's see what does the create\ndo so it says okay you are giving a\ncreate option but you would have to give\na name so let's say let's call it E1 and\nthat will be the name of my instance and\nthis one is an easy command from your\nCloud shell which basically creates an\ninstance you see the Zone which has been\nset it is a standard machine type it is\nnot preemptable it has an internal IP\nand it has an external IP now I have\ncreated an instance and here I can just\ngo back and then I can just do a Refresh\non this page and that already shows me\nthe instance which I have created and\nthen you can use the same method to\nconnect to it using an SSH so I have an\ninstance created from my cloud shell and\nwhat I can do is I can basically look\ninto instances and see what are the\ndifferent options with instance so if we\ndid a create right you have an option\ndelete we did a create you have an\noption delete you can be then deleting\nthe instance from the command line or\nyou can use other options so you can do\na list you can do a stop you can start\nso I can basically do a stop and let's\nsay even let's go ahead and do a stop\ncommands are pretty easy here to\nremember or you can always use the help\noption and now I'm trying to stop the\ninstance and then basically I can go\nahead and delete it so this is a simple\nway where I created a instance from the\ncommand line or from the console which I\nshowed earlier and similarly you can be\nworking with other options so now I've\ncreated stop the instance let's do a\nlisting to see if my instance shows up\nit shows up right and it says the status\nis terminated so you have stopped it\nit's in the terminated status and now\nwhat I can do is I can go ahead and\ndelete\nit so it says this will be lost are you\nsure you would want to continue just say\nyes and that should take care of\ndeleting your instance so this is a\nquick demo on creating your instance we\nhave already seen how you can connect to\nthese instances using SSH now that we\nhave created instances let's also see\nhow to use Google Cloud's storage\nservice which can be used to load data\nor upload data so for this we will have\nto look into your Google cloud storage\noptions and here you can look in cloud\nstorage so let's go back here on the top\nwhich shows me different Services which\nwe have here and let's look into storage\nso this one shows me your storage option\nnow you can click on browser and that\nbasically shows me your storage browser\nwhich shows me on the top you have\noptions for creating a bucket now Google\nCloud Storage allows you to store any\nkind of data here the easiest and the\nsimplest way would be by using Cloud\nconsole although you can again use cloud\nshell and in that you can use your GS\nutil command and GS util basically has\ndifferent options where you can be using\nsay for example I would want to work on\nbuckets so I can be using MB and then I\ncan use my command line option to create\nbuckets I can put in data there I can\nbrowse it and I can access the data from\ncommand line so let's create a bucket\nhere let's click on this let's give it a\nname so let's say my data important\nthat's the name now I can click on\ncontinue straight away I can look into\nall of these options if I'm interested\nin so you can basically be looking at\nyour monthly cost estimate in the\nbeginning now I can click on continue or\nyou can say choose where to store your\ndata and this one shows you different\noptions so you have region\nspecific so let's also give the bucket\nname with all lowercase that's what is\nrequired yeah so coming back to the\nlocation type you can choose multi-\nregion which basically allows High\navailability so your bucket or your\nstorage option will be accessible across\nregions you can also give dual region\nand high availability and low latency\nacross two regions I can also say region\nspecific so for our use case we can just\ngive region specific which can keep our\ncost low but in business use cases you\nwould be going for multi- region now\nhere you have location and I would again\ngo for say Europe Europe and let's\nchoose Europe west3 Frankfurt it is\nalways a good practice that when you\ncreate your instances when you create\nyour storage or you use different\nServices try to have a geographical\nregion Chosen and then you would try to\nput things or your services within the\nparticular region within a particular\nZone unless you would want to make it\naccessible and available across regions\nnow I can then choose a default storage\nclass so when you said default storage\nclass there are different storage class\nand each one is for a different use case\nso you have standard which is best for\nshort-term storage and frequently\naccessed data you have near line so this\nis basically best for backups and data\naccess less than once a month you can\nalso have cold line so these are\nbasically like your cold storage or\nfreezing storage which you might have\nheard generically as terms so you can\nchoose one of these storage classes\ndepending on what will be the use case\nfor this particular storage bucket so\nlet it be standard now how to control\naccess to objects so you can basically\nsay specify access to individual objects\nby using object level permissions now\nyou can give permissions to the bucket\nyou can just say uniform access to all\nobjects in the bucket by using only\nBucket Level permissions so you can\nchoose that you can also go into advaned\nsettings and here you can see different\nways in which you can have configuration\nset up now you can also have a retention\npolicy to specify the minimum duration\nwhere that this buckets object must be\nprotected from deletion and you can set\na retention policy we will not get into\nall that we will just first try creating\na bucket so just click on Create and\nthat should create your bucket wherein I\nhave my bucket now I can click on\noverview to see the details what is the\nregion which region it belongs what is\nthe storage class anytime you can always\nclick on edit bucket and make some\nchanges here you can look at the\npermissions so bucket users F Grand\naccess allowing you to specify access to\nindividual objects and then you can\nbasically look at who has access to this\nso in my case editors of the project\nthey basically are the bucket owners\nowners of project viewers of the project\nright and you can basically choose what\nkind of access you need so for this you\ncan always go into cloud storage and\nthen you can decide what kind of access\nyou would want to give whether that's a\nstorage admin it's an object admin\nobject Creator object viewer and so on\nyou can always look at storage Legacy\nand for any other services depending on\nwhat apis you have enabled right you can\nalways control your permissions so right\nnow it is storage Legacy bucket reader\nand that's fine and this one is bucket\nowner and then might be I was using some\nother services like data proc which uses\ncloud storage and that's why I've given\ndata proc service agent also so these\nare some of the members you can remove\nyou can view by specific members you can\nview by roles so what are the different\nroles which have access to this so it\nsays storage Legacy bucket owner there\nare two owners based on this particular\nproject so these are Auto rolled but\nthen you can add or remove machines you\ncan save storage cost by adding a life\ncycle rule to delete objects after the\nduration of current retention policy so\nyou can add different policies and you\ncan basically control your bucket now my\nbucket is already created right so I can\ngo back and then I see my bucket is\nalready here I can click on this option\nand you can anytime edit the bucket\npermissions you can edit the labels the\ndefault storage class you can just go\nahead and delete the bucket you can\nexport it to Cloud pup sub so basically\nif you would want to have the content\nfrom this bucket being accessible in a\nmessage queuing system you can go for\nPub sub you can process with Cloud\nfunctions and you can scan with cloud\ndata loss prevention so there are\ndifferent options which are available we\ncan always select this bucket and delete\nit now I can click on the bucket and\nthat basically shows me different ways\nin which I can upload some dat data here\nso I can just click on upload files and\nhere then I can choose some files so for\nexample I'll go in here I'll go into\ndata sets and I have different data sets\nso for example let's choose this one\nwhich is a CSV file and then I'm just\nuploading this to my cloud storage right\nit's as simple as this so you can drag\nand drop your files or you can just\nupload your files and my file is\nuploaded here now I can be basically\nedit permissions for this one right so\nthis is in the bucket so anyone who has\naccess to this bucket can basically\ndownload this file it can they can copy\nmove or rename this you can export it\nand you can look at the permissions of\nthis file so let's look at edit\npermissions and it says for this project\nwhoever is the owner it has access I've\nalso given a specific user my Gmail ID\nand I've given access so at any point of\ntime you can just say add item and then\nyou can start giving different kind of\naccesses so let's click on cancel here\nnow my data is already uploaded into\nthis particular bucket and that's a\nsimple usage of your cloud storage now\nwhat we can also do is I can basically\nselect this and I can delete it I can\nalso create specific folders and then\nbasically uh load data into it I can\nclick on this one I can just do a\ndownload and then I can download it\nanywhere on my machine so let's go to\ndesktop and let's download this file so\nwe not only uploaded some content in the\nbucket but we also downloaded that in a\ndifferent location which will be\naccessible now what I could have also\ndone is I could have created a folder\nhere and I could have specified say for\nexample immediate immediate\ndata okay and I'm clicking on this one\nso that's my immediate data I can click\non this one and now I can upload my data\nspecifically to this particular folder\nby using the same mechanism you can just\ndo upload file let's choose air\npassengers let's do a open and my file\nwill be\nuploaded so you can always choose what\nis the retention expiry date for this\none so as of now there is nothing right\nbut you can be deleted objects can be\ndeleted or modified until they reach\ntheir minimum duration you can control\nall of that you can basically download\nit right you can copy it and you can\nmove it and rename it so this is a\nsimple example where I created a\nparticular bucket right now if for\nexample you click on this transfer so it\nsays cloud storage data transfer\nproducts have moved you can now find\nstorage transfer service on premise data\nand transfer Appliance in new data\ntransfer section right so you can always\ngo back to cloud storage you can also\nlook at transfer options which are\nmainly when you are using a on premise\nservice and you would want to upload\ndata in a Google Cloud right so this is\nmy bucket here now I can go to Cloud\nconsole and here what I can do is if I\nwould be interested in working so I can\njust say GS util right and then we have\nuh for example let's try a help okay and\nthat basically shows me my GS util now\nyou can always go to Quick Start GS util\ntool and this is one more way wherein\nbasically you can do it from the command\nline so working with buckets so you can\ndo a GS util MB minus B and then on a\nparticular Zone if you would be\ninterested in and then you can say GS\ncolon and give a name so my awesome\nbucket this is how you will create a\nbucket which will show you it is\ncreating a bucket and then basically you\ncan upload an image or some data from\ninternet you can just do a WG download\nthe file and then you can just do a GS\nutil copy command and that basically\nwill pick up the file from your Cloud\nshell location put it in your bucket\nonce you have done that you can always\ndo a copy right so here you are doing a\ncopy from your local machine that is\nyour Cloud shell machine to your bucket\nand you can do the reverse of that that\nis you can do a copy and you can point\nyour bucket and the file and download it\nto your desktops so you can just\ndownload that using the command line and\nyou can copy the object to a folder in\nthe bucket so that is by creating a\nparticular folder and you pushing the\nfile into a particular bucket you can\nlist the contents of a bucket using LS\nand then give your bucket name so GS\ncolon so we can just try this one to be\nsimple and rest you guys can try so here\nyou can just do a GS util you can do a\nLS GS colon SL slash and then I need to\ngive my bucket name so in my case the\nbucket name was my data important so\nlet's try that so let's say my data\nimportant and I'm trying to list the\nbucket and the content it has right and\nthen you have a folder and then you can\nlook into the folder and look into the\nfiles so this is a simple quick option\nwherein you can use your Cloud shell you\ncould be using your Google Cloud SDK\nfrom your local machine or you can be\nusing Cloud console to create a bucket\nupload some data on it download the data\nsee if the data is accessible and that\nbasically shows you the power of cloud\nstorage where you can easily upload any\nkind of data now what we can also do do\nis as you're using a free account or\neven a paid account unless and until you\nwould want to keep the bucket you can\nselect it and you can just go ahead and\ndelete it so this will basically ask you\nto ke the bucket name and let's say my\ndata important you need to confirm your\nbucket name click on confirm and you\ncould have done that using GS util and a\ndelete command from the command line\nthat is from cloud shell so we have now\ncreated a bucket we have uploaded some\ndata into it we saw how you can download\nit or create a folder and upload some\nspecific data into it and also you can\ndo the same thing using GS util tools\nwherein you can list your bucket create\nyour buckets delete it create some\nfolders into it and do everything from\nthe command line so this is in simple\nway you can use your gcp where either\nyou can spin up your machines or you can\nuse cloud storage to basically use a\nstorage or a easy to use instance on\nGoogle Cloud platform welcome to this\ntutorial about Google Cloud platform and\nhere we will learn about cloud computing\nwhat is cloud computing what is\ngcp that is your Google Cloud platform\nwhat are the benefits of Google Cloud\nplatform and what are its different\nServices a little bit about Google's\ninfrastructure a comparison of different\nCloud providers such as Google offering\ngcp that is Google's Cloud platform\nAmazon offering Amazon web services and\nMicrosoft which offers Azure we will\nalso learn about Domino's Piza use case\nand then have a quick demo on using some\nof the services on\ngcp before we begin let's understand why\ncloud computing and it would be always\ngood to learn about Cloud Compu\nbased on a use case there are varied use\ncases where organizations are adopting\nor moving their Solutions or their\ninfrastructure into cloud or I can\nsimply say integrating with Cloud now\nhere is one use case Nina started a\ncompany that relates to website\ndevelopment the challenges which Nina\nwas facing were low memory space\nwhenever required for processing or for\nany other kind of application related\nwork high traffic to website that\ncrashed it and also less number of\nservers now with these challenges she\nwas then referred to concept of cloud\ncomputing and how that could benefit and\nhelp her in solving her issues most of\nher issues were solved when she started\nusing cloud computing and with cloud\ncomputing she could increase her memory\nspace as required that is on demand\ncontrol the load to the website that is\nbasically load balancing and handling\nmore requests on the website or requests\nper minute buying servers at a lower\nprice that is scaling up or down based\non the\nrequirement when we talk about cloud\ncomputing cloud computing is use of\nhardware and software components which a\ncloud provider offers as a service which\ncan be accessed over Network cloud\ncomputing is use of these resources\nwhich could be either dedicated\nresources or coming from a pool of\nresources which cloud provider offers to\ndeliver a service to clients users can\naccess these different Services\napplications files from any device which\ncan basically access\nInternet cloud computing allows\nautomatic software\nintegration it allows backing up and\nrestoring of\ndata it basically offers unlimited\nstorage memory or computation\ncapacity it gives access to reliable\nsources which usually the cloud provider\nthemselves are using for their use case\nand it is a cost efficient model which\nhelps organizations to quickly integrate\nor basically modernize their\ninfrastructure cloud computing is\nusually used with it or within it space\nwherein there are five traits if there\nis a requirement of\nresources as the business dynamically\nchanges or grows so for this CL\nComputing offers on demand\nself-service so users could be using on\ndemand Computing\nresources or memory resources storage\nNetwork and so on provided by cloud\nprovider and also do a\nself-service all this is possible using\na simple interface and users can be\nusing processing power storage Network\nas they need and pay as they go so there\nis least or no human intervention\nrequired when it comes to projects which\nmight need scalable network access cloud\ncomputing offers broad network access\nthat is accessing resources over Network\nacross geographical regions or what we\ncall as availability zones which might\nbe multiple sites within a particular\ngeographical region Cloud providers also\nhave what we call as resource pooling so\nthis this basically provides a huge pool\nof resources which are shared and can be\naccessed by customers at a lower cost\nnow there might be customers which are\ninterested in not sharing the resources\nand would be interested in dedicated\nresources and in this case cloud\nprovider also have so tenant offerings\nwhich help such customers if an IT\nbusiness or any other business needs\nrapid\nelasticity then cloud providers also\nhave resources which are offered which\nare elastic you can get more resources\nrapidly as needed and thus you can scale\nup and down think of a gaming company\nwhich would be interested in launching a\nnew game and they would have predicted a\ncertain number of users which would get\nonto the portal playing the game and\nwhat happens if the request per minute\nor if the number of users who are\njoining in might increase now in this\ncase organization would want an\nunderlying solution which handles this\ndynamism scales as needed on demand and\nonce the demand is done scales down this\nis possible using a cloud computing\nsolution cloud computing Solutions also\ninclude measured services that is pay as\nyou go model for the usage or for the\nreservations which a user or\norganization would have made for\nresource sources offered by cloud\ncomputing so when we talk about cloud\ncomputing one of the question which\nalways arises is why is this model so\ncompelling why is this so interesting\nfor organizations or users who would\nwant to use one or many services from\ncloud computing so first wave of trend\nwhich brought storage cloud computing\nwas what we call as Colo that is\ncollocation it shops that have been\nusing or or managing huge amount of data\nfrom decades basically wanted to\nbuild their infrastructures to handle\ntheir business needs now instead of\nbuilding costlier data centers they\nwould rent space or share facilities and\nthis was being done by organizations\neven in past thus they would free up the\ncapital for other use cases now this was\nmore of user configured manage and\nmaintained by them later organizations\nstarted thinking of virtualization so\nthat was again user configured but\nprovider managed and maintained so\ncomponents of a virtualized data center\nmatched that of a physical Data Center\nand organizations would have virtual\ndevices separately managed from\nunderlying devices then later came\ncontainer based architectures of or\nbasically automated services so within\nGoogle services are automatically\nprovisioned and configured letting your\ninfrastructure scale on demand there are\nvarious reasons why an organization\nwould think of integrating with cloud or\nbenefiting by using cloud and thus\ninstantaneously reaping the benefits of\nmodernizing their\ninfrastructure now few famous Cloud\nproviders are here so you have Amazon\nwhich offers Amazon web services and a\nhuge list of services which come in with\nthis you have Microsoft's Azure you have\nOracle Cloud you have saap's Cloud\nSolutions gcp which is offered by Google\nSalesforce and so on there are many\nother small players which are also\nproviding different Services which are\ncloud-based or organizations which which\nare partnering with these main Cloud\nproviders thus offering cloud services\nto their\ncustomers when we talk about why Google\nCloud platform there are various reasons\nwhy someone would choose Google Cloud\nplatform gcp has better pricing compared\nto its\ncompetitors when it comes to Speed and\nPerformance it is very fast and\nincreases the performance of the\nproject live migration of apps and and\nthere are huge number of solutions which\nI will show you further in further\nscreens which help an organization to\nadopt to a cloud platform or integrate\nwith Cloud platform or even completely\nmigrate into a cloud platform none of\nGoogle's competitors provide live\nmigration of apps when we talk about Big\nData AI machine learning kind of\nsolutions gcp provides lot of innovative\nsolutions in compar to other Cloud\nproviders such as AWS Azure and so\non so what is Google Cloud platform it\nis a set of Cloud Computing Services\nprovided by Google that runs on the same\ninfrastructure that Google uses to and\nfor its end user products like YouTube\nGmail and so\non let's learn about benefits of Google\nCloud platform\nsuch as high productivity working from\nanywhere quick collaboration high\nsecurity fewer data stored on vulnerable\ndevices reliable resources which can be\nused across organization across\ngeographical regions across\ncountries very flexible which allows\norganizations to scale up and down as\nthe demand Rises or as the demand\ndeclines and cost effective Solutions\nfor various use cases these are some of\nthe benefits and if we look into\ndifferent Services which Google Cloud\nplatform offers we could look into\ndetailed benefits which each service\noffers in a different use case which\nbasically helps organizations working in\ndifferent domains handling different\nkind of small mid or larger businesses\nand with different business goals\nwhen we talk about Google Cloud platform\nServices here is a list of services or I\ncould say highlevel domains or\ncategories of services so you have\ncompute related Services you have\nstorage and database you have networking\nBig Data developer tools identity and\nSecurity Management Internet of Things\nCloud AI management tools and also data\ntransfer Solutions\nwhen we talk about Google's\ninfrastructure Google has one of the\nmost powerful infrastructure in the\nworld the infrastructure is available in\ntwo levels the physical and the abstract\nlayers you have physical infrastructure\nand then you have the abstract\ninfrastructure physical infrastructure\nconsists of data centers extensive\ndevelopment of high efficiency backend\ndata\ncenters you have a very strong backbone\nNetwork which is used by Google itself\nand also offered as services to\ncustomers via gcp platform services so\nyou have Global mesed redundant backbone\nNetwork points of presence when we talk\nabout Google it has 110 plus Edge points\nof presence in more than 200 countries\nand when we talk about Edge caching Edge\ncaching platform at periphery of their\nNetwork so this\nis what defines the physical\ninfrastructure of Google now there is\nmuch more to it rather than just these\nfour points when we talk about abstract\ninfrastructure that is divided in global\nregions and zones when we talk about\nZone a zone is roughly equivalent to a\nData Center and a single point of\nfailure so you could have your compute\nengine which is within a zone or you\ncould say compute engine is a Zone\nresource you have regions which are\ngeographical areas which contain\nmultiple zones so you could have a\nregion for us Central or Europe Central\nEurope West and so on and within a\nregion you would have one or multiple\nzones and zones basically would allow\nHigh availability of\nresources so you have Cloud load\nbalancer as an example which is regional\nresource then you you have global\nresources and they are available and\nshared across the planet so you have\nvarious global resources such as Network\nwhich could be even your IP addresses\nand so\non now let's do a quick comparison of\nAWS WS Azure vers gcp and let's look at\nwhat each cloud provider offers later we\nwill also look into different services\nin detail when it comes to Google Cloud\nplatform what each service does what you\ncan benefit from which service should\nyou use in what case we will learn about\nthose in later slides if I compare your\ndifferent Cloud\nproviders when we talk about Amazon and\nits Cloud offerings that is Amazon web\nservices or AWS as we well know it\nAmazon web services has 69 availability\nzones with in 22 geographical locations\nand soon it will have 12 more in future\nso this number keeps growing based on\nthe spread of the services which a\nparticular cloud provider offers here we\nare talking about availability Zone\nspecific information when we talk about\nMicrosoft's Azure it has 54 regions\nworldwide and is available in 140\ncountries across the globe when we talk\nabout Google Cloud Google Cloud platform\nis available in 200 100 plus countries\nacross the\nglobe when we talk about virtual servers\nAmazon's ec2 that is elastic compute\nCloud it is a web service which\nbasically helps to resize your compute\ncapacity where you can run your\napplication programs on a virtual\nmachine so using ec2 service you could\nlaunch virtual instances that could have\nany distribution of Linux Windows you\ncould have different specifications when\nit comes to Ram or CPU course or disk\nyou could also decide on what kind of\nstorage a particular instance should use\nwhether the storage should be local to\nthe instance or whe whether that should\nbe a elastic file system or even an\nobject\nstorage when it comes to Azure or\nMicrosoft's offering Azure virtual\nmachine that is infrastructure as a\nservice gives a user the ability to\ndeploy and manage a virtual environment\ninside a virtual Network on the cloud\nand this virtual Network on the cloud\nwould be managed by cloud provider\nGoogle cloud or the offerings from\nGoogle Cloud platform that is gcp VM\ninstances enables users to build deploy\nand manage virtual machines in order to\nrun different kind of workloads on the\ncloud now when we talk about compute\nengine here it would be good to discuss\na little bit more about compute engine\nand what are the different options which\nGoogle Cloud offers so when you talk\nabout your compute engine you have\nscalable high performance virtual\nmachines computer engine delivers\nconfigurable virtual machines which run\nin Google's data center with access to\nhigh performance networking\ninfrastructure and block storage and you\ncould select VMS for your needs that\ncould be general purpose or workload\noptimized and when we talk about\nworkload optimized you have predefined\nmachines or you have custom machine\nsizes you can integrate compute with\nother Google cloud services such as AI\nor ML and go for your data analytics you\nhave when we talk about your gcp VM\ninstances just to expand on that you\nhave general purpose instances which we\ncall as\nN2 which provide a balance between price\nand performance and they are well suited\nfor most workloads including line of\nbusiness applications web servers and\ndatabases Google Cloud also offers\ncompute optimized instances which we\ncall as C2 instances which offer\nconsistent high-end virtual CPU\nperformance which are good for AAA\ngaming Eda HBC and other applications\nnow when when we talk about compute\noptimize or general purpose how would we\nleave memory optimized instances those\nare M2 machines which Google offers so\nthese offer highest amount of memory\nthese VMS are well suited for inmemory\ndatabases such as sap Hana realtime\nanalytics and inmemory caches so if I\nwould summarize this when we talk about\ndifferent instances\nAWS also offers different kind of instan\nwhich are memory or compute or dis\noptimized you have general purpose and\neach category of machines has a\ndifferent pricing model you can always\ngo to an AWS website look for the\npricing models and that will give you an\nidea of on demand instances or dedicated\ninstances reserved instances and so on\nsimilarly if you talk about Google Cloud\nGoogle Cloud also has instances with\nvarious options\nwhich become the key features of why\ncustomers would choose Google Cloud\nplatform such as live migration for VMS\nso compute engine within your gcp can\nlive migrate between host systems and\nwhen I say live migrate it basically\nmeans without rebooting which keeps your\napplication running even when the\nunderlying host systems require\nmaintenance you also have preemptible\nvirtual machines wherein you can run bad\njobs and fault tolerant workloads on\npreemptible VMS to reduce your virtual\nCPU and memory cost by up to 80% while\ngetting the same performance so these\nare your preemptive or preemptible\nvirtual machines the only demit is these\ncan give you a really cost efficient\nresource usage however can be taken off\nthe shelf anytime and that's why we call\nthem preemptible virtual machines you\nalso have sold ten noes which are\nphysical compute engine servers\ndedicated explicitly or exclusively for\nusers use case and when we talk about\nSoul tenant nodes these are usually good\nwhen you are dealing with or when you're\nworking with your applications which we\ncall as bring your own license\napplications so Soul tenant nodes give\nyou access to same machine types and\nvirtual machine config options as\nregular compute instances so there are\ndifferent options which Google Cloud\noffers when it comes to these instances\nwhich we are talking about and it takes\ncare of different use cases in\ncomparison to other Cloud providers\nwhich are also offering these services\nsuch as you can have predefined machine\ntypes you can have custom machine types\npreemptable VMS as I said live migration\nof VMS you can use persistent diss which\ncould give you durable high performance\nblock storage you have local ssds you\nalso have GPU accelerators which can be\nadded to accelerate computational\nintensive workloads such as machine\nlearning simulation medical analysis and\nso on and you have features such as\nGlobal load balancing which makes Google\nCloud a unique\nChoice when we talk about platform as a\nservice Amazon has platform is a service\noffering which we call as elastic bean\nstock among one of its services it's an\norchestration service for deploying\napplications and helping in maintaining\nthese applications aure cloud service\nprovides a platform to write the user\napplication code without worrying about\nthe hardware resources Google app engine\nis a service used by Developers for\nbuilding and hosting applications on\nGoogle's data centers when we talk about\nserverless Computing so Amazon's AWS\nLambda is a serverless compute service\nit is used to execute backend code and\nscales automatically when required when\nwe talk about aure you have something\ncalled as functions which allow users to\nbuild applications using serverless\nsimple functions with a programming\nlanguage of their choice when we talk\nabout Google cloud gcp has Cloud\nfunctions which is easiest way to run\nyour code in the cloud and it is highly\navailable and Fa tolerant so in these\ndays when we are talking about\nmicroservices architecture which\norganizations are preferring when we are\ntalking about organizations which can\nscale which can dynamically change their\nunderlying architecture organizations\nwould be interested in server less\ncomputing where they do not have to have\na infrastructure setup a and in advance\nbefore going for their use case and this\nis where monolithic applications are\nreally not a Preferred Choice a lot of\norganizations are decomposing their\napplications into microservices based on\nbusiness capability or decomposing based\non subdomains we can learn about\nmicroservices architecture later but\njust to know that serverless Computing\nwhich basically helps any organization\nif for example if you have a web\napplication that receives nonlinear\ntraffic and you cannot keep an eye on\nyour server always it would be good to\nhave someone to autoscale your\napplication serverless is basically a\nComputing model where cloud service\nprovider is responsible for managing the\npiece of code without the developer\nhaving to bother about infrastructure\nsetup management maintenance and so on\nnow when we talk about applications\nbeing serverless or benefiting from\nserverless Computing one of the key\nthings would be zero Administration so\ndeploying application without any\nprovisioning and management autoscaling\ncapability that is let the service\nprovider worry about scaling the\napplication up and down you have paper\nuse model which any customer would want\nto benefit from that is pay only for the\nresource that you have used or that you\nare continuing to use right shorten the\ntime between idea implementation and\ndeployment and this is something which\nany organization would want that you\nwould want a faster bring to the market\nsolution timeline in comparison to\ngetting entangled with deployment\nmanagement and maintenance of your\nunderlying infrastructure when your\napplications are facing a high demand\nso when we talk about serverless it is a\nfunction as a service because each part\nof your application is divided as\nfunctions and can be hosted over\nmultiple service providers you have\nserverless apps which are usually\ndivided as separate units or functions\nbased on functionalities or domains and\nso on so serverless Computing is gaining\nquite popularity these days in\ncomparison to the traditional three tier\narchitecture\nwhere you had a presentation layer you\nhad an application layer you had a\ndatabase layer now that kind of\ninfrastructure is not really preferred\nin today's modern times when\norganizations are working on different\nkind of newer\napplications when we talk about object\nstorage Amazon has simple storage\nservice that is S3 it provides object\nstorage which is built for storing and\nrecovering information or data from\nanywhere over the Internet Azure comes\nup with blob storage that is binary\nlarge objects storage offers large\namount of storage and scalability it\nstores the object in the tiers and\ndepending on how often the data is being\naccess now same thing applies to even S3\nwhich is from Amazon so S3 also has\ndifferent kind of storage classes which\ncan be selected when a user or a\norganization intends to use a storage\nservice and when I speak about storage\nclasses it basically means having a\nfrequent access storage or a infrequent\naccess storage or what we call as just\nan archival\nsolution Google cloud has cloud storage\nand it provides unified object storage\nfor live or archive data the service is\nused to store and access data on gcp\ninfrastructure when it comes to\nadvantages Amazon web services has\nEnterprise friendly Services easy access\nto resources increase in Speed and\nAgility and that to on demand and takes\ncare of your security and reliability of\nresources which are offered when it\ncomes to eure it has better development\noperations strong security profile\nprovides lot of cost effective Solutions\nand operation execution friendly when we\ntalk about Google Cloud one of the key\nfeatures here is better pricing than\ncompetitors live migration of virtual\nmachines which really interests lot of\norganizations would want to modernize\ntheir infrastructure without having any\nkind of disruption in their existing\nServices improved performance redundant\nbackups and so on when it comes to\ndisadvantages in AWS you have\nlimitations when it comes to ec2 service\nwell there are different options in the\nkind of machines which you can choose\nwhich you can work on you have a\ntechnical support fee which is incurred\nnetwork connectivity and then also\ndowntime which might be in case when\nyou're migrating as your it has\ndifferent code base for cloud and\npremise platform as a service ecosystem\nis not really as efficient as\ninfrastructure as a service poor\nmanagement of GUI and tools integrated\nbackup when we talk about Google Cloud\nsupport fee is quite Hefty it depends on\nwhat kind of solution or support you\nwould or organization would be\ninterested in it has a complex pricing\nschema although it has different use\ncases for which any user or any\norganization can benefit from\ndownloading data from Google cloud\nservices is an expensive option storage\nmight not be however uploading data or\ndownloading data would be an expensive\noption when we talk about Domino's Piza\nuse case now while we were discussing\nabout these features I would really want\nto spend more time in discussing each of\nthese features or services in detail\nsuch as you have compute engine you have\nstorage you have big table you have data\nproc and so on so there are huge list of\nservices now before we get into your\nDomino's Piza use case let me show you\nthis page on Google Cloud where you can\nlook at different services so if you go\nto cloud.google.com and if you look at\nget started option under doc so here you\ncan find build Solutions look at\ndifferent use cases learn from basics of\nwhat is your Google Cloud what are Cloud\nBasics then you can look at different\nCloud products so here you have products\nin different categories such as Ai and\nmachine learning API management compute\ncontainers data analytics databases\ndeveloper tools and so on and you can\nalways click on any one of these to look\ninto different solutions which are being\noffered what are the different use cases\nwhat are the best practices when it\ncomes to migrating VMS to compute engine\nor operating containers or building\ncontainers and so on you can always look\nat featured products and that gives you\na quick snapshot of what are the\ndifferent products such as you have\ncompute engine you have Cloud run big\nquery which is a data warehouse you have\ncloudsql which is a managed MySQL or\npostgress you have cloud storage to\nbasically push in any kind of data there\nyou have security key enforcement Ai and\nmachine learning and so on so you have\ndifferent feature products now if you\nscroll down to the lower end of this\npage you can again look at different\nsolutions and that would be really\ninteresting to read and learn from so\nyou have infrastructure modernization\nyou have application modernization you\nhave data management and so on so if I\nlook at infrastructure\nmodernization you could basically look\nat the solutions which Google Cloud\noffers and what it does when it comes to\nhaving your infrastructure modernized or\nbenefiting by integrating with cloud and\nhaving immediate benefits of\ninfrastructure modernization you can\nlook at different use cases what they\nare doing how Google Cloud really helps\nwhen it comes to migrating the workloads\nto a cloud and how your different Cloud\nSolutions such as VM migration you have\nsap on Google Cloud VMware as a service\nand so on and you could learn from these\ndifferent solutions which are offered\nyou can also look at application\nmodernization so not only infrastructure\nmodernization but organizations would\nalso be interested in relooking at their\napplications relooking at how these\napplications could be moved from\nmonolithic to microservices architecture\nor how applications can benefit from\nmodernization and cloud computing\nofferings so you have again different\nuse cases here H which talks about\ndifferent ways which Google Cloud can\nhelp how you can modernize your\napplications how you can use different\nsolutions which Google cloud is offering\nnow when we talk about Cloud Computing\nServices you can always go into\ncloud.google.com\nif you have created a free account then\nyou can just login and every user by\ndefault gets a $300 free credit so\nwherein they can try out different\nproducts where they can use different\nservices so here if I click on Console\nwhere I'm already logged in with my\nGmail account or my Google Cloud account\nwherein I have $300 free credit out of\nwhich some is being used you have a\nGoogle Cloud console and here from the\nhamburger menu you can click and you can\nlook at different services within\ndifferent domains so you have compute\ndomain which has different services such\nas app you have compute engine and that\nbasically allows you to use your VM\ninstances which we were talking about\nprevious slides different instance\ngroups create your templates use Soul\ntenant nodes create snapshots or backup\nof your data use different zones you can\ngo for kubernetes which is containerized\nbased engine you have Cloud functions\nyou have Cloud run and then you have\nstorage related different options such\nas big table you have data store fire\nstore file store storage and so on and\nfor each of these Services you can read\nabout from the Google's documentation or\nanyways I will be explaining that later\nyou can also look at networking related\noperation related and other tools which\nare offered by Google Cloud so these are\nhuge list of services which Google Cloud\nplatform offers in different ways for\ndifferent use cases now let's look at\nthis Domino's Piza use case and see what\nit helps us learn about so you can\nalways access this page by going to this\nlink which talks about customers and\nthen which shows you different use\ncases so Domino's increasing monthly\nRevenue by 6% with Google analytics\npremium Google tag manager and Google\nbig query so this is basically when\nDomino's started using gcp and what was\nthe result of of that now let's look\nfurther into\nthis so we all know that Domino is most\npopular Piza delivery chain operating\nacross the globe but how is that\npossible let's take a look so the\nchallenges were they wanted to integrate\nmarketing measurement across various\ndevices connecting CRM and Digital Data\nto create a clear view of customer\nBehavior to make make cross Channel\nmarketing performance analysis easy and\nefficient now for these challenges which\nDomino's was facing the solution was\nusing Google analytics premium Google\ntag manager and big query which were\nused to integrate Digital Data sources\nand CRM data reporting was made easier\nand more efficient by implementing\nGoogle analytics premium because it had\nthe ability to access a single Google\nAnalytics account to evaluate web and\napp\nperformance by using the new Google tag\nmanager implementation Dominos were able\nto act fast they were able to connect\nCRM data with digital analytics which\nbasically provided Domino with greater\nvisibility on customer Behavior what was\nthe result there was an immediate 6%\nincrease in monthly Revenue 80% of costs\nin ad serving and operations for SA D\nincreases agility with streamline tag\nmanagement they obtained easy access to\npowerful reporting and customized\ndashboards now that was just one simple\nuse case before we go on to handson we\ncan also talk a little bit back about\nthe services which Google Cloud offers\nas we discussed and some of these\nServices which can really make you think\nwhy not Google Cloud CL platform so when\nwe talk about your different Cloud\nplatform Services let's learn about some\nof these services in brief in what each\nservice is what it does and how it can\nhelp us in handling our use cases or\nworking with different products so let's\nlearn briefly about different Services\nwhich Google Cloud platform offers now\none of the domains is compute and then\nlet's look at the compute Services which\ngcp offers now here I can log into the\nconsole and this hamburger menu on the\ntop left corner I can click on this one\nand go into the compute engine section\nso this is the compute domain which has\napp engine kubernetes engine Cloud F\nfunctions and Cloud run so these are\nyour different Services which are\noffered within the compute domain and\nhere we can get into compute engine by\nclicking on this one and then basically\ngoing to VM instances so before we see\nhow we can use this compute engine let's\nunderstand about some of the features of\ncompute engine which basically offer\nscalable high performance virtual\nmachines which are configurable and\nwhich runs in Google's data center with\naccess to high performance networking\ninfrastructure and block storage so from\nhere you can select VM for your needs\nfor your general purpose or workload\noptimized predefined or custom machines\nnow here you can integrate compute with\nother Google cloud services such as AI\nML and other data analytics Services you\nhave different machines which are\noffered here such as general purpose\nwhich provide a balance between price\nand performance which are well suited\nfor most workloads including line of\nbusiness applications web services and\ndatabases you also have compute\noptimized machines which offer con\nconsistent high-end virtual CPU core\nperformance and which are mainly good\nfor gaming Eda High process Computing\nand other such applications apart from\ngeneral purpose compute optimized you\nalso have memory optimized machines\nwhich offer highest amount of memory and\nthese VMS are basically well suited for\nin-memory databases such as sap Hana\nrealtime analytics and inmemory cache\nnow we can see these options here you\ncan click on VM instances while you're\nlogged in into your Google Cloud console\nhere you can even create an instance\ntemplate which can be used to spin up\ninstances for example if I click on new\nVM instance from a template there are\nsome templates which I have already\ncreated for my usage now here I can\nbasically use one of these templates or\nwhat I can do is I can go back I can go\ninto instance templates and this\nbasically allows me to create a template\nso you can click on create instance\ntemplate which basically allows you to\ncreate templates which can be used to\nspin up different instances we can give\na name to the template for example we\ncan say template instance now here I can\nchoose machine configurations and this\nis where you have different options so\nyou have general purpose as I mentioned\nwhich provide a balance between price\nand performance you have memory\noptimized which are large memory machine\ntypes for memory intensive workloads you\nalso have compute optimized which\nbasically give you high performance\nmachine types for compute intensive\nworkloads so you can choose any machine\nconfiguration which is available here\nbased on your requirements now if you\nclick on general purpose that has\ndifferent options here so you look into\nthe series where you have N1 series you\nhave E2 which are CPU platform selection\nbased on availability you have N2 and\nn2d so let's just have N1 selected now\nyou also have here which talks about\nmachine types and here we can choose the\nconfiguration which we are interested in\ndepending on the applications which will\nrun within the machines we can choose a\nmachine so by default it shows one\nvirtual CPU core and 3.5 gab of memory\nor Ram you could choose a higher end\nmachine so as of now I'll just say N1\nstandard now that basically allows me to\nchoose these machines so there are\ndifferent features which your computer\noffers such as you have live migration\nfor VMS you have preemptable virtual\nmachines you have soul tenant nodes and\nall those options can be seen here now\nin this machine for my boot dis I can\nselect a distribution which I would be\ninterested in for example I could be\ngoing for public images and I can choose\nfor example ubu and then I can choose a\nversion so it shows me\n16.04 and you also have latest versions\nsuch as UB 220 you can choose one of\nthese and here it asks you to choose the\nboot disk type so that could be standard\npersistent disk which is hdds which are\nlow in performance and uh you can say\nlow in cost in comparison to ssds so\nssds give you better performance but\nthen they are little expensive than\nusing standard persistent disk we can\nchoose this and we can give a disk size\nfor example 20 GB and I can click on\nselect before clicking on select I can\nclick on custom images and that shows me\nif you have any other images created in\nyour project you could use those you\ncould also learn about images by\nclicking on this link so we'll click on\npublic images we have chosen this\ndistribution let's do a select and now\nhere you have identity and API access\nmanagement so let this be default you\ncan say allow default access\nand what you need is depending on the\nservices we can choose it allows HTTP\nand https traffic now we would also need\nsome way to connect to these machines so\nwhen you set up an instance by default\nyou can do SSH into it using the Google\nCloud console or from cloud shell you\ncan also give a private and a public key\nso here you have the option where you\ncan give all these details so when it\ncomes to management it tells you would\nwould you want to go for reservations\nand you can say automatically use\ncreated reservation you could also say\nno you would not want to use a\nreservation you can also set up or\nprovide a startup script which you would\nwant to give whenever your machines come\nup and here you have the options of\npreempt ability so compute offers\npreemptable virtual machines so that is\nmainly when you would want to run bad\njobs and fault tolerant workloads on\nthese machines and and you can benefit\nwith a reduced cost for your virtual CPU\nand memory by\n80% so these are virtual machines which\nwould be lasting less than 24 hours now\nby default this is off and it purely\ndepends on your workload what you would\nwant to run on these instances I could\njust go ahead and select preemptible\nbeing on that and use this feature of\ncompute you also have on host\nmaintenance which talks about what would\nbe happening with this computer engine\ninstance so when compute engine performs\nperiodic infrastructure maintenance it\ncan migrate your VM instances to other\nhardware and this is one of the features\nwhich compute engine offers which we\ncall as live migration for VMS here your\ncomputer engine can live migrate between\nhost systems that is the underlying\nsystems on which these VM instances are\nbased on without rebooting which will\nkeep your application running even when\nhost system require maintenance\nmaintenance and here it says migrate VM\ninstance recommended and let that be as\nit is you can also say that if there is\na maintenance happening you can\nterminate the VM instance now it also\ntalks about automatic restart which is\non which basically means computer engine\ncan automatically restart VM instances\nif they are terminated from nonuser\ninitiated reasons so these are all the\nsettings which are available in\nmanagement and it also tells us the\ndifferent features which we have there\nis also a feature called sold tency\nwhich basically means sold tenant sold\ntenant nodes which can be chosen so you\ncan have physical compute engine servers\ndedicated exclusively for your use and\nthis is usually good when you're talking\nabout bring your own license\napplications so Soul tenant nodes give\nyou access to same machine types and VM\nconfiguration options as regular compute\ninstances however these might be a\nlittle expensive we can choose this one\nwe can also look into networking which\nbasically shows the default setup which\ngoes for auto subnet you can also choose\na particular IP if that is required but\nthat would cost more you can click on\ndiss which talk about what do you want\nto do with the boot dis when the\ninstance is deleted what is the\nencryption mechanism you would want to\nuse and here finally you have security\nso basically as I said you can SSH into\ninstance using the cloud console option\nand you can also provide a public SSH\nkey so one way of doing that if you\nintend to use an external SSH client\nsuch as puty to connect you can create a\nkey so for example I can go into puty\ngen and here I can say generate just\nmove my cursor over here and that will\ncreate a key I can give a name to this\none so I'll say sdu will be username\nI'll give a simple password which I will\nuse to login to the this machine and\nthen I can save this private key which\nwill get saved so let's say hdu new key\nand this gets saved in a PPK file which\nis usually used when you use an external\nSSH client to connect so save this one\nand that saves a PPK file on your\ndesktop what you can also do is you can\ncopy this public key content from here\nand this is what we would want to give\nin our instance here so so that the\npublic key gets stored on the instance\nand private key is what we will use to\nconnect so once I paste it here it\nresolves the name to hdu and we have\ngiven the public key now in certain\ncases you may want to use a software\nwhich uses SSH to connect to the machine\nand that software might not be such as\nyour puty so in that case you may want a\npem file or a private key which is saved\nas a do pem file so you can also do that\nby going to conversions and do a export\nop SSH key and then save it so I'll say\nhdu new key but then this one will be\nsaved as a pem file on my machine so you\nhave PPK file which allows you to use\nputy to connect to the instance you have\na pem in case a software needs directly\nSSH to these machines you also have the\npublic key which we have already\nprovided in the machine now once this is\ndone I can clck puten I can go back to\nthis page where I'm creating an instance\ntemplate and then I can just click on\ncreate so this has created a instance\ntemplate which I can use to spin up my\ninstances any number of instances using\nthe same template only thing which I\nwould have to do is change the region\nwhere I would want the instance to run\nso now that we have created instance and\nthat's my this one the third option I\ncan go back to VM instances now I can\nclick on Create and here I can either\ncreate an instance from scratch by\ngiving all the details again or I can\njust use my template so I can click on\nnew VM instance from a template choose\nmy template click on continue and once\nthis is done I can give my instance name\nso let's say C1 I can choose the region\nso I will choose Frankfurt and then rest\neverything is autop populated based on\nthe template what you have given and you\nclick on create now this basically\nallows you to spin up an instance and\nyou can create any number of instances\nusing your template you could have\nalready created a new instance right\nfrom scratch now once the instance is\ncreated this has a public IP and a\nprivate IP private IP will not change\nunless you would want to set up a new\nmachine but public IP will change every\ntime you stop and start the machine now\nthis is what we need to connect to this\nmachine I can also do a SSH from here by\ndoing this in open in a browser window\nlet's click on this so this is an\ninternal way of connecting to your\ninstance using SSH let's wait because it\nwould be transferring the SSH keys to\nthe VM it establishes a connection and\nI'm connected to my machine what we can\neasily do is to confirm if we are in the\nright machine we can just do a LS to\nlook at the file system what we can also\ndo is we can basically log in as root by\ndoing a pseudo Su and that allows you to\nget into the machine as rout and from\nhere I can switch to hdu user which will\nhave a SSH directory in home and that\nbasically has authorized keys and if we\nwould want to see if this one contains\nmy public key I can just do a cat. SSH\nand then look into authorized keys and\nthis shows me the public key which we\nhad initially added to our instance so\nthis confirms that we are logged into\nthe the machine which we created now I\ncan close this and what I can also do is\nI can copy this public IP so let's do a\ncopy to\nclickbuy and here I will say host name\nwhere I'll say hdu give my public key\nI'll click on SSH and in SSH I'll go to\nauthentication now here we need to give\nour PPK file so the PPK file was sdu new\nkey select this one come back here come\nto the session\ngive it a name for example C1 save it\nand then you can just say open and say\nyes and you are logged in to your\nmachine now once you're logged in you\ncan always do a minus SSH and that shows\nyou the file so this is how you have\njust used the compute engine to spin up\nan instance but we used a template which\nbasically allowed me to create this\ninstance and then I can connect to this\ninstance and then I can start working on\nthis so when we talk about features of\ncomputer engine it has predefined\nmachine types as we saw so computer\nengine offers different predefined\nvirtual machines and this they have\nconfigurations for every need from small\ngeneral purpose instances to large\nmemory optimized instances with up to\n11.5 tab of ram you can have fast\ncompute instances optimized up to 60\nvirtual CPU cores you also have custom\nmachine types so you can create a VM\nthat best fits your workload and by\ntailoring a custom machine type to your\nspecific need you can realize\nsignificant savings there are\npreemptible VMS which we saw there is\nalso a facility which allows you to take\nthe benefit of live migration for VMS\nyou have durable high performance block\nstorage for virtual machine instances in\nthe form of persistent discs where data\nis stored redundantly for integrity\nflexibility and to resize stor storage\nwithout interruption and you could be\nchoosing sdds or sdds for your instances\nnow you also have option such as GPU\naccelerators so for example if I just\nclick on create instance and I can look\ninto that so here let the instance name\nbe instance one and what I would be\ninterested in looking at this one which\nsays CPU platform and GPU so CPU\nplatform configuration is permanent you\ncan also do add GPU so gpus can be added\nto accelerate computationally intensive\nworkloads like machine learning\nsimulation medical analysis and virtual\nworkstation applications so you can add\nand remove gpus to a VM when your\nworkload changes and pay for GPU only\nwhile using so these are some of the\nfeatures which basically compute engine\noffers and we already know that Google\nbuilds in second level increments so we\nonly pay for the computer time now there\nare different savings which are possible\nso you have commitment savings which\nbasically means you can save up to 57%\nwith a upfront cost per instance type\nlockin you have container support so you\ncan basically run manage and orchestrate\nDocker containers or compute engine\ninstances so here when we are setting up\nour instances there is an option which\nbasically allows you to use or deploy\nDocker images now that can be done you\ncan also benefit from sustained use\nsavings that is sustained use discounts\nwhich are automatic discounts for\nrunning compute engine resources for\nsignificant portion of the billing month\nyou can create a reservation for VM\ninstance in a specific Zone which is\nbasically seen under your management\nsection here and you can ensure your\nproject has resources for future\nincreases in demand and if no longer\nneeded delete the reservation so these\nare some of the features of compute\nengine what we have done is we have\ncreated compute engine using the console\nnow you can go back you can also do that\nusing Cloud shell and you can click on\nthis one which activates Cloud shell you\ncould also have the cloud SDK support on\nset up on your machine which can be used\nnow I can just open this in a new window\nand from here I can start giving\ncommands if I would be interested in\nsetting up an instance from my command\nline so here you have different options\nnow to begin with you can just do a\ngcloud and just hit enter and that will\nshow you different options which are\navailable which can be used so you have\ngcloud compute here which shows an\noption to create and manipulate compute\nengine resources now I can just do a q\nto quit I can do gcloud compute and that\nbasically will again show me different\noptions options which are available if\nyou would be interested in setting up\ninstances from the command line so here\nI can say gcloud compute and then go for\ninstances and if you do not know the\ncommands you can just hit enter that\nwill show you all the different options\nwhich we have so here we have different\noptions such as list or create or start\nor update for example I can just do a\nlist here to see what instances I have\nand the instance which we just created\nshows up here it says that status is\nrunning I can just stop this instance I\ncan delete this instance I can even\ncreate an instance by using a create\ncommand here and you can just do a\ncreate help which will show you what are\nthe different options you can give so it\nsays instance name is what you need you\ncan choose an accelerator you can choose\nthe boot dis and various other options\nso I I can just say create and then I\ncan give a name for example C2 and once\nI click on this one it says did you mean\nEurope West for zone so it is asking me\nfor the region and the zone and I can\nsay yes and these settings are coming\nfrom my default profile I can always\nchange those by changing the metadata so\nnow we have created an instance it says\nrunning if we do a list again to see we\nsee two instances created one was in\nEurope West 3 one was in Europe W West 4\nboth of them have internal and external\nIPS now you can do a describe to look at\nthe different options here so g-cloud\nbasically allows you different commands\nwhich you can use to work with your\ninstance to create instances to change\nthe metadata if you would want to change\nthe region if you would want to add a\nstartup script all those options are\npossible from the Comm on line which we\ncan learn in detail in later sessions so\nthis is your compute engine as a service\nnow that we have learned about the\ncompute domain and G compute Services\nwhich is offered by gcp let's also learn\nabout storage and databases that's again\nwithin the storage domain and the\nservices which are offered by Google\nCloud platform now you can go back to\nconsole and here you can click on on\nthis one and here you can just scroll\ndown to see what are the different\noptions in storage so you have options\nsuch as big table you have data store\nfire store file store you have SQL Based\nServices you have storage which is\nobject storage and then you have other\noptions which are available so Google\nCloud platform offers different storage\nBased Services out of which storage\nwhich is your object storage is quite\npopular one click on storage and that\nbasically shows you an option which\ntalks about storage browser so this is\nyour Google Cloud's object storage so\nwhen we talk about object storage it is\nbasically a storage where you could\nstore any kind of data and when we talk\nabout object storage it is a bunch of\nbytes which we address wherein every\nobject will have a unique key these\nunique keys are in the form of URL which\nallows you to access the object object\nso cloud storage is comprised of what we\ncall as buckets which are used to store\nand hold your storage objects the\nstorage objects are immutable and every\nchange creates a new version now you can\nalso have control access via am that is\nidentity access management or via Access\nControl list so there is also an option\ncalled object versioning which basically\nsays if it is on every time you try to\nstore the same object a new version of\nthe object would be created otherwise\nnewer option will override old one as we\ncannot archive the old version so let's\nsee how we work with this object storage\nso here you can click on create bucket\nnow once you click on create bucket it\nneeds a name so let's say test bucket\nand here I can just give say number one\nso that says this is the name of my\nbucket now I can directly click on\ncontinue or it would be good to look at\ndifferent options which are available\nhere so when you click on choose where\nto store your data so it already gives\nme an option it says the bucket name is\nalready taken so let me give it a unique\nname so let's say test buck and let's\ncall it AUA so that should be unique now\nhere it says choose where to store your\ndata so this one gives you location type\nso you can have region specific buckets\nwhich give you lowest latency that is\nfastest response time within a single\nregion however it does not make your\nstorage highly available you can make a\ndual region which is basically allowing\nyour bucket or storage to be accessible\nacross regions you can also make it\nmulti- region which is highest\navailability offered as of now we can\nchoose region specific and now it asks\nyou to choose a location now as always I\nwill choose Frankfurt now I can click on\ncontinue and rest all the rest let all\nthe storage options with default or you\ncan click on a default storage class now\nthat tells you based on your storage\nclass there are variant costs when it\ncomes to storing retrieving or doing any\nkind of operations so you have a\nstandard option which says best for\nshort-term storage and frequently Access\nData you can also go for Cold Storage\nsuch as near line which is best for\nbackups and data access less than once a\nmonth you can go for freezing storage\nsuch as cold line best for disaster\nrecovery and data accessed less than\nonce a quarter or you can go for\narchiving where the data is accessed\nless than once a year let's go for\nstandard as of now and now you can\nchoose how to control access to objects\nso you have fine grain or uniform let it\nbe fine grained wherein you can give\nadditional permissions at Bucket Level\nusing IM am or object level permissions\nusing access control list in advanced\nsettings you can choose the encryption\nand you can also choose a retention\npolicy so a retention policy to specify\nthe minimum duration that this buckets\nobjects must be protected from deletion\nor modification after they are uploaded\nyou can always learn about this more by\nclicking here now once I've chosen all\nthe relevant options I can click on\ncreate\nand that basically will create a bucket\nby the name I have given I can click on\noverview to basically see brief details\nabout my bucket such as region what is\nthe default storage class and it also\nshows you the link URL which can be used\nto access your bucket it also gives you\nthe link for GS util now GS util is a\ncommand which can be used in your Cloud\nshell to basically work with your\nbuckets you you can click on permissions\nto basically see what kind of\npermissions are already in place and you\ncan then make changes you can basically\nadd members you can view by different\nroles so for example here by default it\nshows other services such as data proc\nor your bucket owner or bucket reader\nrelated permissions which have been\nalready granted now once I've looked at\nmy bucket I can start using it I can\ndrag and drop and files here so as of\nnow there are no live objects in my\nobject storage that is in my bucket what\nI can do is I can click on upload files\nand then I can choose a location from my\nmachine for example I'll go to data sets\nand what I can do is I can choose some\nof the files here in any format let's\nchoose CSV or text and just do open so\nthis one will basically upload my data\nsets here now once I've uploaded the\nfiles I can basically close this one I\ncan look into options here which says\nedit permissions edit metadata if you\nwould want to download it if you would\nwant to copy move or rename it if you\nwould want to export to a different\nservice called Cloud Pub sub which is\npublish subscribing messaging system you\ncan scan the data now you can click on a\nparticular file and that basically shows\nyou the URL which basically allows you\nto access this file you can try copying\nthis you can click on download and\ndownload this file you can even try\naccessing this from public and that\nbasically shows you the content of this\nfile based on the permissions so this is\nbasically your object storage which is\none of the service which is offered what\nyou can also do is you can create\nfolders and within folders you can then\nupload your data so this is your Google\nCloud Storage option which is for your\nobject storage that is you can add\ndifferent items you can give different\npermissions and you can use this Google\nCloud platforms storage service offering\nnow you also have other options such as\nbig table and we can go into that by\nclicking here and click on big table so\nbig table is one of the service which\nkickstarted no SQL databases today in\nMarket we see different nosql databases\nsuch as cassendra hbase mongod DB couch\nDB Neo 4J and many others so you can\nbasically use big table which was the\npineer when it comes to your no SQL\ndatabases or not only SQL databases so\nthe problem initially faced by Google\nwas that uh the web indexes behind\nsearch engine were taking too long to BU\nbu so company wanted to build database\nthat would provide realtime access to\npetabytes of data and that's where big\ntable began so big table powers\ndifferent other Google services such as\nGmail Google Maps and other services and\nin\n2015 it was launched as a service for\ncustomers so when it comes to\nscalability with use of big table you\ncan increase your machine count without\nany downtime and you can handle admin\ntasks like upgrades restarts and so on\nwhich are basically taken care by the\ncloud provider data present in Cloud big\ntable is encrypted and you can use IM\nroles to specify access so data written\nto or from big table is through data\nservice layers such as managed virtual\nmachines hbas rest servers Java Services\nhbas client and so on here if I would\nwant to use big table I can click on\ncreate instance and that basically tells\nme Cloud big table instance is a\ncontainer for your clusters now here you\ncan give a instance name so for example\nI will say\nAUA and then say for example test and\nlet's say big table so that will be the\nname of instance this will be permanent\nyou can choose the storage type again\nyou can go for lower latency more rows\nred per second typically used for\nreal-time serving use cases or you can\ngo for sdds which have higher latency\nfor random reads good performance on\nscans and typically used for batch\nanalytics so let's go for ssds as of now\nhere you have cluster ID which is autop\npopulated you can choose a region so\nlet's go for our favorite one here where\nI can say Europe West 3 I can choose a\nZone here and I can then choose how many\nnodes would I want to use for my big\ntable so when you talk about big table\nservice it will have a cluster\nunderlying which will have various nodes\nwhich will control your data throughput\nstorage and rows read per second so as\nof now let it be just one node and\nthat's enough for our demo when we talk\nabout performance it basically tells you\nbased on the current node and storage\ntype it tells you how many reads can\nhappen at millisecond so it says 10,000\nrows per second at 6 millisecond you\nhave rights which are 10,000 rows per\nsecond or you have scans which are 220\nmegabytes per second storage which is\ntaken care here would be 2.5 tabt and I\ncan then basically click on create now\nthere is also some option called\nreplication guidance which basically\nsays replication for cloud table big\ntable copies your data across multiple\nregions enabling you to isolate workload\nand increase the availability and\ndurability of your data depending on\nyour use case you can have big table\nwith which can be used to have your data\nacross regions now you can click on\ncreate with all your specifications\nChosen and that's going to set up a\ncluster or you can say a fully managed\nnosql database which will give you low\nlatency and replication for high\navailability now once we have a new\ninstance you can connect to it with the\nCBT command line tool and for\ninstructions you can click on learn more\nhere you can just click on this instance\nID to see the details again if you would\nwant to look into your big table setup\nso it tells me here that we have one\ninstance what is the CPU utilization\ntime how many rows were read or written\nwhat is the throughput and this is autop\npopulated based on your usage you can\nclick on monitoring and that basically\nwill give you different widgets which\nwill display information for your CPU\nutilization what is your hottest node\ndepending on how many notes you have\nsystem errors automatic failovers\nstorage utilization and so on you can\nclick on key visualizer which will allow\nyou to look into your table if you have\nalready created some data here and you\ncan click on tables to see how many\ntables you have added here so that's in\nbrief about your big tables which is one\nthing which we need to remember is it's\nnot good for all use cases so should be\nused for low incy access that is fast\naccess and good if at least data is\ngreater than 1 tbyte for smaller amount\nof data the overhead is too high so big\ntables performance will suffer if you\nstore individual elements larger than 10\nmegabytes if you want to store bigger\nobjects such as images video files then\ngo for object storage and that would be\na better option so always remember big\ntable is not a relational database it's\na nosql database and when you talk about\nmulti transactions or online transaction\nprocessing big table is not the right\nchoice so it can be used for wide range\nof applications ESP especially when you\ntalk about your olap that is online\nanalytical processing so it is designed\nto store key value Pairs and there can\nbe different use cases so for example if\nyou're using something like cloud data\nflow or cloud data proc where you would\nwant map reduce kind of operations big\ntable can act as a good storage because\nit has very high throughput and\nscalability and the best thing is that\nit supports hbas API thus allowing easy\nintegration with Apache Hadoop and Spar\nclusters which you can bring up using\none more service which Google Cloud\nplatform offers which is called cloud\ndata proc so big table is good for\nreal-time analytics it's commonly seen\nin financial services iot and others and\nif you are thinking of running\ninteractive SQL then big table would not\nbe the right choice but the other choice\nwould be big query you should also\nremember that this has a cluster running\nand you would be charged if this cluster\nkept on running so you have to be very\ncareful in your free account when you're\nusing such Services now we have clicked\non this one so I can select this one and\nbasically I can look at the permissions\nI can look at the labels I can look at\ninherited permissions here I can also\nclick on my\ninstance which we created and either you\ncan edit or you can just do a delete so\nas of now we will just delete this which\nneeds you to give the name so we'll say\nAUA test BT and then click on delete so\nwhenever you are trying out different\nServices the first approach should be\nsetting up these different Services\nseeing how they work basically trying\nconnecting to them and once you are\nsatisfied with the initial test then you\ncan plan your actions and come back and\nuse the service for a longer duration\nnow that's your big table which is one\nof the offerings we can go back into\nstorage and here you have other options\nwhich are available so for example we\nwere in big table you also have an\noption such as cloud data store now\nthat's one more service which is offered\nby Google Cloud platform when it comes\nto storage domain so Google added\nsoftware on top of big table which\nsupports more than simple key value\npairs when you talk about secondary\nindexes instead of just having one\nprimary index when you talk about asset\nproperties for Reliable transactions\nsuch as SQL query like language so these\nfeatures or these Services were added to\nor on top of your big table which gave\nbirth to a new service which was\nreleased as cloud data store so this is\nwhere you have cloud data store and you\ncan select a CL Cloud fire store mode so\nyou can go for a native mode enable all\nCloud fire stores features with offline\nsupport or you can go for Cloud's data\nstore system on top of clouds fire store\nso these are different options here and\nhere we look at the API or scalability\nengine support how many rights it\nsupports and so on you can choose one of\nthese and then you can choose where to\nstore your data so for example if I\nclick on this one then it choose asks me\nto choose a location so it says the\nlocation of your database effect its\ncost availability and durability choose\na regional location lower right latency\nlower cost or multi- region location\nhere I can basically choose for example\nEurope and then I can go ahead and\ncreate a data datase so it says\ninitializing Cloud fire store in data\nstore mode services in eu3 this usually\ntakes a few minutes you'll be redirect\nto your database once it is ready so if\nwe compare the pricing structure between\ncloud data store and Cloud big table\nalways remember cloud data store you pay\nfor monthly storage which is also in the\ncase of big table however here you are\npaying for monthly storage for reads and\nwrs but in case of big table you're\npaying for cluster when it is running so\ncloud data store is a good option for\nsmall data in frequent access and it\nacts cheaper when you talk about large\namount of data or big data and frequent\naccess then you are talking about Cloud\nbig table so big table is cheaper when\nyou talk about larger amount of data so\nhere it says since your database is\nempty you can still switch to Cloud fire\nstore in Native mode to get more\nfeatures you could do that you could\nlearn you could say query by\ngql as of now we don't have any data\nhere let's look at the dashboard which\nsays since your database is empty you\ncan still switch to cloudfire store in\nNative mode to get more features so this\nis your cloud data store and it has many\nfeatures which help you to work with\nyour data however some features or\nimportant features of rdbms's were still\nmissing and\nthat's where Google created yet another\nbig table based service called Cloud\nspanner now we can continue working on\ncloud data store which basically gives\nyou one option to work with your data\nyou can create an entity here by\nclicking on create entity and that\nbasically gives you options such as\ndefault name space you can give a kind\nyou can give numeric ID and you can\nstart adding properties but to learn\nmore about data store we will learn\nabout this in further sessions so as of\nnow I'm going to click on cancel I'm\ngoing to go back to my data store and\nthis basically let's go to data store\noption or I can go into admin here which\nbasically says if you have entities you\ncan import or export them so let's go\nback and let's again look into storage\noptions so as of now we were in data\nstore let's click on this one\nso as I mentioned your cloud data store\nwhich basically gives you some\nadditional features on top of your big\ntable but what Google also did was it\nrealized that there was a need for rdbms\nfeature support that is there were lot\nof features now here we have created a\ndata store and it says your datab base\nis ready to go just add data you can\ncreate entity start putting in data and\nthen you can go ahead and query this so\nif you want to learn more about your\ndata store you can just click on this\none and that takes you to the complete\ndocumentation of native mode and data\nstore mode what is fire store in Native\nmode what is in data store mode what are\npricing and locations how you choose a\ndatabase mode what are the feature\ncomparisons what you can do what you are\nallowed to do here what programming\nlanguages can be used different regions\npricing and so on as of now we'll click\non this one and let's look at one\nadvanced service which Google Cloud came\nup with when it comes to your additional\nfeatures of rdbms so Google created yet\nanother big table based service called\nCloud spanner now that you might not see\nhere but if you scroll down you should\nbe able to see your Cloud spanner in the\noptions here or did we miss it on the\ntop so let's again look here yeah so it\nis here and you can click on spanner so\nCloud spanner was released in 2017 it\nbasically supports relational schema so\nit offers strong consistency for all\nqueries which can be SQL based you can\nhave multi- region deployment now when\nit comes to massive scalability\nrequirement and strong consistency Cloud\nspanner is a good option so it says\nCloud spanner is a managed Mission\ncritical globally consistent and\nscalable relational database so if you\nwould want to use this then you will\nhave to enable this a API where it shows\nyou an option here it says try this API\nso it's a managed service so it is one\nof the Google's most expensive database\nServices there is also one more database\nservice which is cloudsql which can be\nused so when we talk about your Cloud\nspanner it is fully managed relational\ndatabase service it is massively\ndistributed you can have millions of\nmachines across hundreds of data centers\nwith support automatic shard and\nsynchronous replication it gives you low\nlatency and schema updates without Dum\ntime making data High availability and\nreliability so we'll learn about Cloud\nspanner with more details later in other\nsessions now we can also go back to\nstorage and we can look at the different\noptions which we have here so you have\nobject storage you have spanner you also\nhave your SQL based service which is is\nyet another manage service offered by\ncloud or Google Cloud I would say so\nthat's called cloudsql so this is\nbasically a service which allows you to\nhave fully managed relational MySQL\npostgress and SQL Server databases\nGoogle handles replication patch\nmanagement database management and other\nthings which are related to this managed\nor fully manage database service it can\nallow you to handle terabytes of storage\ncapacity\nwith\n40,000 iops with huge amount of ram per\ninstance so you can click on create\ninstance here and then you can choose\none of the database which you would want\nto use so cloudsql is a manage service\nyou can choose one of your MySQL or post\nand SQL Server say for example I choose\nMySQL now that basically tells me what\nis the instance ID it sets up a password\nyou can always change the password you\ncan change the region you can choose\nyour database version and then you can\nalso look at other configuration options\nwhich talk about machine type which will\nbe used what is about your backup and\nRecovery maintenance and all that and if\nyou click on create this will basically\ncreate a fully managed SQL service which\ncan allow you to straight away start\nusing MySQL on cloud thus allowing you\nto store your relational data when we\ntalk about storage options how can we\nnot talk about a data warehouse solution\nor basically an option which allows you\nto run your queries by directly updating\ndata so you can use a data warehouse\nservice which Google Cloud platform\noffers and that's called big query so\nbasically you can be looking into the\nBig Data section here and here you have\nan option called Big query so this\nbasically brings ease of implement\nmentation and speed so building your own\ndata Weare house can be expensive time\nconsuming and difficult to scale so with\nbig query you just load data and pay\nonly for what you use so it when it\ncomes to Features you have features such\nas capability to process billions of\nrows in seconds and if you would want to\ndo realtime analysis of streaming data\nthat is also possible here so here we\nhave clicked on big query which\nbasically shows you the option where you\ncan start typing your query and test\nyour data access for example if I have\nuploaded some data so it shows me there\nare some queries which are saved here\nnow I can schedule your query I can\nbasically choose the format of a\nparticular query by clicking on this\nmore here I have an option which says\nadd data so I can pin it to a particular\nproject I can explore public data sets I\ncan create a connection so if I click on\nexplore public data sets then it takes\nme to a page from where you can get\ndifferent kind of data sets which are\nalready available which you can put into\nyour big query and start querying your\ndata by default it shows that it is\naligned to my project and I don't need\nto worry about it I can look at saved\nqueries if I have already saved a\nparticular query I can look at job\nhistory I can look at transfers\nscheduled queries and reservations so\nbig query basically initially had its\nown version of SQL which was slightly\ndifferent from standard SQL but in 2016\nbig query 2 was release that supports\nSQL 2011 standard you can always select\nstandard SQL now big query when it comes\nto pricing we need to remember that the\nstorage is the storage cost is very less\nhere approximately 02 cents per GB per\nmonth it is almost similar to near line\nwhere you you can also have low cost\nthat is 01 cents per gigabyte per month\nthere is no charge for reading data from\nStorage when it comes to querying and\nthat's where the cost is incurred so 1\nterabyte per month is free and after\nthat it costs few cents per gigabyte so\nthis is mainly for high volume customers\nthere is a flat rate P pricing which can\nbe used so when you talk about querying\nyou can save your query results you can\ncreate data set to store the results now\nresults are put in a temp table in Cache\nand after you are done with that you can\ndelete data set and delete all the data\nso when you talk about loading data into\nbig query you can get the data from\ncloud storage Google Drive cloud data\nstore stack driver stack uh driver other\noptions you have Cloud big table or\nother web interface bis so you can\ndownload from URL such as CSV Json AO\nyou can create data set create table and\ncreate from Source by doing a file\nupload so 10 megabyte or less files can\nbe uploaded using web interface as an\noption you can also use command line and\nthen you can start working with your big\nquery so here you can also work with\nstreaming data by basically pushing in\nstreaming data into your big query which\nallows you to add one record at a time\nnow you could use something like cloud\ndata flow which allows you to use a\nparticular pipeline about cloud data\nflow we will learn later so you can\nbenefit from different features of big\nquery and thus use Google's offering to\nwork on your structured data or I would\nsay data which suits well in data\nwarehouses now these are some of the\nstorage related Services which Google\nCloud offers although we will learn\nabout using big query and running or\nuploading some data by creating add data\nset here by say creating connection or\nusing a public data set so as of now I\nhave this you can also access the\ncommand line to work with this but we\nwill learn in detail about big query in\nlater sessions now here you can scroll\ndown and you also have an option within\nBig Data space and that is your data\nproc so when you talk about data proc\nthis is again a manage service which\nallows you to run spark or Hadoop jobs\nso especially if you are interested in\nBig Data workload so for big data\nprocessing for machine learning you can\nalways use cloud data process\nthis uses compute engine instances under\nthe hood but takes care of management of\nthese instances so it's a it's a layer\non top to spin UPF clusters it's a\nmanage service it's cheaper pay when the\njobs are running only it's fast because\nit it is integrated with other Google\ncloud services you have open- Source\ncomponents pre-installed and data proc\nis integrated with Yan to make cluster\nmanagement easier when you talk about\ndata proc you can click on create\ncluster and that basically allows you to\nset up your cluster by choosing a\nparticular region which you would want\nto use for example I'll choose Europe\nWest 4 here it tells what kind of\nmachines you would want to use and by\ndefault it has populated as the machine\nhere which is 4 CPU and 15 GB now since\nyou might be using a free account let's\nnot go for the highend machine let's go\nfor N1 standard 2 and then you can\nscroll down it says what is the primary\ndisk what is the disk type and this one\nwas for your master machine that is\nmachine which will have the master\nprocesses running then you have your\nworker node configuration which tells\nthis will be let's choose a lower end\nmachine and we can choose how many\nworker notes you would have so it says\nminimum to you can choose the ssds and\ntheir capacity it talks about yarn cores\nand Yar memory which will be allocated\nand here we have then option of clicking\non create so once you click on create\nthis will basically spin up a cluster\nwherein you can straight away start\nsubmitting jobs to this you can\nbasically go ahead once your cluster is\nready you can go into the cluster you\ncan submit a job you can choose a type\nwhich is spark or any other application\nwhich you would want to run and then\nbasically you can use this fully managed\nservice which allows you to run your big\ndata clusters you can obviously control\naccess via roles or Access Control list\nand you can have access as it is at\nproject level or based on your data proc\ncluster or even at your worker notes so\nwe'll learn about data proc in later\nsessions so as of now you see here the\ncluster is getting created it's says the\ncloud storage bucket which it is using\nis this one now I can click on this and\nopen link in a new tab it still takes me\ninto console but now it is showing me\nthe bucket which is being used by your\ndata proc cluster this is the bucket\nwhich is being used and it is being used\nfor un underlying metadata which gets\nstored here so you look at the cluster\nrelated folders you can click in these\nfolders and then it can see what is the\nscript output what it is doing and so on\nnow I can come back here to my bucket\nwhich will basically show me what kind\nof buckets have been created so you see\ndata proc service automatically created\nsome buckets which will be holding some\ndata you also have some other buckets\nwhich were created based on other\nservices which we used the access\ncontrol is fine grained in all cases\nplus it also shows our bucket so\nunderlying it is using compute instances\nit is basically using let's go here and\nlet's go to compute engine and let's\nlook into VM instances so data proc\nwhich has spun up a cluster is also\nusing the VM instances which we see here\nare running it is using the buckets and\nit has made a cluster ready to use so\nyou can click on this cluster and that\nshows me my cluster related details if\nthere are any jobs running what are VM\ninstances what kind of configurations it\nhas used and you can look at different\ndetails here you can look at the logs\nyou can click on jobs and that will show\nyou if you have basically run a job on\nthis ready to use cluster so it says\nthere is this particular job which was\nrun which was a spark job you can click\non submit and this one tells you what is\nthe job ID what is the region you would\nchoose for example we will again choose\nfor example Europe West 4 four it tells\nwhat is the job type so you can run all\nthese type of jobs in this cluster such\nas Hadoop spark P spark Hive Pig Presto\nyou can give your jar file so if you\nhave packaged your application as a jar\nyou can mention that here you can pass\nin some arguments you can also say some\nother jar files add some properties and\nthen click on submit which will run your\njob on this ready to use cluster now\nsince we have tested it I can basically\ngo ahead and and do a delete I don't\nwant to incur any cost on these manage\nservices which are running so there are\nlot more information about using these\nServices which Google Cloud platform\noffers and we can continue learning\nabout these Services as we explore your\nGoogle Cloud console or even your\ncommand line option now we can come out\nof this one by clicking on this menu and\nthen we have other options such as\nkubernetes you have Cloud function\nfunctions you have your networking\nrelated Services monitoring related\nServices different kind of tools what\nyou have you have other big data\nspecific Services which you can learn\nabout and for each of these service\nGoogle has a very good documentation\navailable for example when you talk\nabout publish subscribe messaging system\nit is a realtime manage service which\nbasically is a Pioneer which was used\nand now you have have a famous service\nsuch as Kafka which is being used for\nyour publish subscribing or messaging\nsystem kind of\nrequirements so to conclude about Google\nCloud platform Services you can always\ngo to cloud.google.com and look into the\ndocument section now here you have list\nof different featured products you also\nhave list of your different domains and\nservices which Google Cloud offers\noffers and you can learn about all the\ndifferent Services which are offered by\nGoogle Cloud here you can click on\nfeatured products and that basically\nshows you compute engine Cloud run cloud\nstorage you have cloudsql big query\nVision AI you can scroll down and look\nat your artificial intelligence and\nmachine learning related Services\nplatform and accelerators API\nmanagement so Google Cloud platform\noffers different services in mainly in\nyour compute storage and databases you\nhave networking related Services Big\nData specifics developer tools Cloud AI\nidentity and Security iot Management\ntools API platform and so on so\nbasically learn about the gcp services\nwhich Google Cloud platform offers and\nin detail you can play around with\ndifferent Services which are offered by\ncreating a free account and as I\ndemonstrated you can use any one of\nthese Services quickart them basically\nconnect to them put in your data or use\na manage service to manage your data and\nbenefit from Google Cloud platform thus\nhaving modernized infrastructure for\nyour different use cases hi guys today\nwe've got something very special in\nstore for you we're going to talk about\nthe best cloud computing platform\navailable Amazon web services uh Rahul I\nthink you said something wrong here the\nbest cloud computing platform is\nobviously Google Cloud platform no it\nisn't AWS has more than 100 services\nthat span a variety of domains all right\nbut Google Cloud platform has cheaper\ninstances what do you have to say about\nthat well I guess there's only one place\nwe can actually discuss this a boxing\nring so guys I'm AA and I will be Google\nCloud platform and I'm Rahul I'll be AWS\nso welcome to night this is AWS versus\ngcp the winner will be chosen on the\nbasis of their origin and the features\nthey provide their performance in the\npresent day and comparing them on the\nbasis of pricing market share and\noptions the things they give you for\nfree and instance configuration now\nfirst let's talk about AWS AWS was\nlaunched in 2004 and is a cloud service\nplatform that helps businesses grow and\nscale by providing them services in the\nnumber of different domains these\ndomains include compute database storage\nmigration networking and so on a very\nimportant aspect about AWS is its years\nor experience now AWS has been in the\nmarket a lot longer than any other cloud\nservice platform which means they know\nhow businesses work and how they can\ncontribute to the business growing also\nAWS has over $5.1 billion of Revenue in\nthe last quarter this is a clear\nindication of how much faith and trust\npeople have in AWS they occupy more than\n40% of the market which is a significant\nsunk of the cloud computing Market they\nhave at least 100 services that are\navailable at the moment which means just\nabout every issue that that you have can\nbe solved within AWS service now that\nwas great but now can we talk about gcp\nI hope you know that gcp was launched\nvery recently in 2011 and it is already\nhelping businesses significantly with a\nsuite of intelligent secure and flexible\nCloud Computing Services it lets you\nbuild deploy and scale applications\nwebsites services on the same\ninfrastructure as Boogle the intuitive\nuser experience that gcp provides with\ndashboards Wizards is way better in all\nall the aspects gcp has just stepped in\nthe market and it is already offering a\nmodest number of services and the number\nis rapidly increasing and the cost for a\nCPU instance or Regional storage that\ngcp provides is a whole lot cheaper and\nyou also get a multi-regional cloud\nstorage now what do you have to say on\nthat I'm so glad you asked let's look at\npresent day in fact let's look at the\ncloud market share of the fourth quarter\nof 2017 this will tell you once and for\nall that AWS is the leader when it comes\nto cloud computing Amazon web services\ncontributes 4 7% of the market share\nothers like Rackspace or Verizon cloud\ncontribute 36% Microsoft a your\ncontributes 10% the Google Cloud\nplatform contributes 4% and IBM software\ncontributes 3% 47% of the market share\nis contributed by AWS you need me to\nconvince you anymore wait wait wait all\nthat is fine but we only started a few\nyears back and have already grown so\nmuch in such a less span of time haven't\nyou heard the latest news our revenue is\nalready a billion dollars per quarter\nwait for a few more years and the world\nshall see and AWS makes $5.3 billion per\nquarter it's going to take a good long\ntime before you can even get close to us\nyes yes we'll see now let's compare a\nfew things for starters let's compare\nprices for AWS a computer instance of 2\nCPUs and 8 GB ram costs approximately\n$68 now a computer instance is a virtual\nmachine in which you can specify what\noperating system Ram or storage you want\nto have for cloud storage it costs 2.3\ncents per GB per month with AWS you\nreally want to do that because gcp wins\nthis hands down let's take the same\ncompute instance of 2 CPUs with 8 GB Ram\nit will cost approximately $50 per month\nwith gcp and as for my calculations\nthat's a 25% annual cost reduction when\ncompared to AWS talking about cloud\nstorage cost it is only 2 cents per GB\nper month with gcp what else do you want\nme to say let's talk about market share\nand options now AWS is the current\nmarket leader when it comes to cloud\ncomputing now as you remember we\ncontribute at least 47% of the entire\nmarket share AWS also has at least 100\nservices available at the moment which\nis a clear indication of how well AWS\nunderstands businesses and helps them\ngrow yeah that's true but you should\nalso know that gcp is steadily growing\nwe have over 60 services that are up and\nrunning as you can see here and a lot\nmore to come it's only a matter of time\nwhen we will have as many services as\nyou do many companies have already\nstarted adopting gcp as a cloud service\nprovider now let's talk about things you\nget for free with AWS you get access to\nalmost all the services for an entire\nyear with usage limits now these limits\ninclude an hourly or by the- minute\nbasis for example with Amazon ec2 you\nget 750 hours per month you also have\nlimits on the number of requests to\nservices for example with AWS Lambda you\nhave 1 million requests per month now\nafter these limits are crossed you get\ncharged standard rates with gcp you get\naccess to all Cloud platforms products\nlike Firebase the Google Maps API and so\non you also get $300 in credit to spend\nover a 12 Monon period on all the cloud\nplatform products and interestingly\nafter the free trial ends you won't be\ncharged unless you manually upgrade to a\npaid account now there is also the\nalways free version for which you will\nneed an upgraded billing account here\nyou get to use a small instance for free\nand 5gb of cloud storage any usage above\nthis always free usage limits will be\nautomatically build at standard rates\nnow let's talk about how you can\nconfigure instances with AWS the largest\ninstance that's offered is of 128 CPUs\nand 4 TVs of ram now other than the on\ndemand method like I mentioned before\nyou can also use spot instances now\nthese are for situations where your\napplication is more fall tolerant and\ncan handle an interruption now you pay\nfor the spot price which is effective at\na particular hour now these SP fices do\nfluctuate but are adjusted over a period\nof time the largest instance offered\nwith Google cloud is 160 CPUs and 3.75\nTBS Ram like spot instances of AWS\nGoogle Cloud offers shortlived compute\ninstances suitable for bad jobs and fall\ntolerant workloads they are called as\npreemptable instances so these instances\nare available at 80% off on on demand\nprice hence they reduce your compute\nengine cost significantly and unlike AWS\nthese come at a fixed price Google Cloud\nplatform is a lot more flexible when it\ncomes to instance configuration you\nsimply choose your CPU and RAM\ncombination of course you can even\ncreate your own instance types this way\nbefore we wrap it up let's compare on\nsome other things as well Telemetry it's\na process of automatically collecting\nperiodic measurements from remote\ndevices for example GPS gcp is obviously\nbetter because they have Superior\nTelemetry tools which help in analyzing\nservices and providing more\nopportunities for improvement when it\ncomes to application support AWS is\nobviously better since they have years\nof experience under their bet AWS\nprovides the best support that can be\ngiven to the customers containers are\nbetter with GCB a container is a virtual\nprocess running in user space as\nkubernetes was originally developed by\nGoogle gcp has full native support for\nthe tool other cloud services are just\nfine-tuning a way to provide cubes as a\nservice also the containers help with\nabstracting applications from their\nenvironment they originally running the\napplications can be deployed easily\nregardless of their environment when it\ncomes to geographies AWS is better since\nthey have a head start of a few years\nAWS in this span of time has been able\nto cover a larger market share and\ngeographical locations now it's time for\nthe big decision so who's it going to be\nyeah who is it going to be gcp or AWS I\nthink I'm going to go for choosing the\nright cloud computing platform is the\ndecision that's made on the basis of the\nuser or the organization's requirement\non that note I believe it's time for us\nto wrap this video up we hope you guys\nenjoyed this video and and learn\nsomething new that AWS is better right\nknow that choosing a platform entirely\ndepends on you and your organization's\nrequirement hello everyone welcome to\nthis session on Google Cloud platform\nwebsite hosting and let's understand\nwhat Google Cloud platform offers when\nit comes to your web hosting\nrequirements here we will learn about\nGoogle Cloud web hosting some basics of\ncloud computing web hosting service\nproviders what is g CCP and why go for\nit different types of web hosting which\nare possible a use case such as Lush and\na quick handson on using gcp for web\nhosting when you talk about Cloud web\nhosting Google cloud has the feature of\nhosting a secure and reliable websites\neasily it ensures customers and sites\nprotection the website is a is hosted on\na fast and reliable Network you can do\nmore work for Less Price with Google\nCloud now when we talk about Google\nCloud it is always good to know some\nbasics of our cloud computing now when\nwe talk about cloud computing cloud\ncomputing is basically using resources\nwhich are provided by your cloud service\nprovider such as Google cloud and cloud\ncomputing basically means using hardware\nand software components to deliver a\nservice on a network now here users can\naccess files applications from any\ndevice that can access Internet so when\nwe talk about cloud computing this is\nbasically using Services which are\nhosted on the infrastructure manag by\ncloud provider when we talk about\nresources which can be used that may\ninclude big data services storage\noptions your Computing options\nnetworking options and various other\nservices which a cloud provider\noffers cloud computing has various\ndifferent service models such as you\nhave platform as a service software as a\nservice infrastructure as a service also\nthese days we talk about containers as a\nservice and these are your different\nComputing service models which are being\noffered by cloud service providers which\nallow you for Auto automatic integration\nwith your existing environment or if you\nwould want to benefit from modernization\nby using a cloud providers\ninfrastructure you have different\nServices which are offered some of them\nare for auto software integration or\nmigration backing up and restoring data\nscaling your storage capacity that is\ngoing for an unlimited storage capacity\nand us a resource provided by cloud\nservice provider benefiting from\nreliability cost efficiency which is\noffered by a cloud provider in this case\nwe are talking about Google Cloud when\nyou talk about web hosting service\nproviders there are various web hosting\nservice providers you have AWS you have\nsquare space IBM Cloud GoDaddy Blu host\nand Google Cloud so what is gcp and why\ngo for it\nwhen you talk about gcp or as we call it\nas Google Cloud platform it a set of\nCloud Computing Services provided by\nGoogle that runs on the same\ninfrastructure that Google uses for it\nend user products like YouTube Gmail and\nmuch more when you talk about gcp there\nare various reasons why anyone would\nchoose it for their use cases now let's\nlook at some reasons when you talk about\npricing gcp has better pricing\ncompared to its competitors depending on\nthe services which you would use whether\nthat would be infrastructure as a\nservice such as using compute engine\ninstances and running your applications\non them or might be a managed service\nsuch as data proc or big table or your\nbig query where you can have your Hado\nclusters running or store huge amount of\ndata or even build your data warehouse\nwherein you can store structured data so\nthere are different services with gcp\noffers and pricing has been a better\noption in case of Google in comparison\nto other competitors when you talk about\nSpeed and Performance it's very fast and\nincreases the performance of your\nproject if you use different services\noffered by\nGoogle when you talk about live\nmigration of apps this is one of the\nfeatures which organizations usually\nlike which none of other computers are\noffering when it comes to live migration\nof apps so there are specific features\nfor example when you talk about computer\nengine there is a feature stating live\nmigration wherein your resources or your\ninstances which are running applications\nwould be migrated during say maintenance\nfrom one underlying host to another\nunderlying host without affecting your\napplication's performance and you can\nbenefit from that when you talk about\nBig Data Google cloud has various\nofferings in Big Data space and that's\none of the advantages of gcp in\ncomparison to other competitors you have\ndifferent services for your big data\nneeds such as Pub sub for publish\nsubscribing messaging system or going\nfor data proc which basically allows you\nto spin up your Hadoop and Spark\nclusters to run your different jobs and\nso on so when we talk about features of\nGoogle Cloud platform it offers High\nproductivity because you are using the\nresources which are based on the same\ninfrastructure which Google uses for its\nown different use cases you can work\nfrom anywhere provided you have internet\nconnection and you can connect to the\ncloud platform and use different\nservices offered via web you can quickly\ncollaborate with different teams or\ndifferent colleagues working on\ndifferent projects which might be\nsharing or using different gcp resources\nyou are benefiting from high security\nand different encryption and security\nmechanisms with gcp offers now there are\nfewer sources or you could say data\nwhich is stored or vulnerable devices\nthere is high reliability flexibility or\nscalability which gcp offers and the\ncost Effectiveness really makes it as a\ngood choice when you would want to\nbenefit from infrastructure model\nmodernization and using a cloud platform\nsolution for your use case now when you\ntalk about different types of web\nhosting Google Cloud offers three types\nof web hosting you have WordPress now it\nis a free and open- Source content\nmanagement system you might have used in\npast or have heard about WordPress where\nlot of websites are being created it is\na popular web publishing platform to\neasily set up blogs and websites and\nthus used by organizations or even\nindividual users for having their blogs\nor running their websites or promoting\ntheir products you have lamp which\nstands for Linux Apache MySQL and PHP\nand lamp stack consists of Linux Apache\nHTTP server MySQL and PHP and is used to\nhost websites and web\napplications you also have your option\nof building your own website so you can\ndevelop website or web application with\nyour own code directly on compute engine\nnow let's look at a use case and\nunderstand what happened here when we\ntalk about Lush so Lush was founded in\n1995 it's you might have seen this brand\nsomewhere in the streets it is a global\nCosmetics retailer headquartered in UK\nit sells a diverse range of fresh\nhandmade products Lush had become a\nglobal brand with over 900 13 stores in\n49 countries so the challenges which\nwere faced here was traffic on boxing\nday caused website crash for almost 18\nhours and this is something which had a\ndevastating effect on their business the\nprevious platform had no scalability\noption what was the solution the\nmovement of website during the peak time\nwas easy due to flexibility of gcp\nplatform with rapid VM deployment on\nGoogle compute engine the environment\nwere monitored and destroyed in minutes\nso the team could test and deploy at\nspeed by using go Cloud SQL Lush took\ncomplete control of its infrastructure\nand optimize its systems for Effective\nscaling overall the platform resulted in\nlower cost that led to a bright future\nfor Lush Cosmetics now what was the\nresult of all this the availability\nduring Peak loads was improved because\nof Google compute engines Auto scaling\nfeature the infrastructure hosting costs\nwere reduced by 40% streamline data\ncenter usage from 5 to 3 with Google's\nhighquality private Network really\nbenefited Lush and it provided a\nflexible architecture and scalability\nfor future business growth now what we\nhave seen here is that your Google cloud\nand its web hosting basically offers\nusers to run their websites or use a web\nhosting solution that can benefit in\nmore than one way the simplest approach\ncould be seen is by clicking and setting\nup a VM instance by going to your\nconsole for example if we go in to the\nGoogle Cloud platform clicking on\nconsole and here the easiest way I could\ntest it is by going to my compute engine\nVM instances and here I can spin up an\ninstance I can click on create now in my\nprevious sessions I have also explained\nabout how you could create a template\nand run an instance from that we can\nalso click on new VM instance let's call\nit new instance I will choose a region\nfor example Frankfurt I will let it be\ngeneral purpose machines let this\nmachine be one virtual CPU core and 3.75\nGB Ram if I'm looking for a heavier\nwebsite which might have more users\nlogging in and so on then I can choose a\nhigher configuration machine here we\nhave the option to choose our\ndistribution so for example I can choose\nu 2 and then I can choose a distribution\nversion so let it be\n16.04 we can choose the dis size to be\n20 GB and we can use ssds or hdds so as\nof now it is standard persistent dis\nthat is sdd and that should be enough\nlet's click on select here I will say\nallow default access I would say allow\nHTTP and\nhttps so that if I have a website\ncontent hosted on this machine I can\naccess it over HTTP now here you have\nmanagement options for your instance you\nhave security option which basically\nallows you to provide a public key if\nyou are interested in using an external\nSSH client to connect now I have used\nputy gen and I have already created a\nprivate key which is here I have also\nconverted that as a pem file and anytime\nif I would want to use this key all I\nneed to do is click on puty gen where I\nhad earlier created this PPK file now I\ncan just do a load and I can choose the\nkey which I have here and I can give the\npass phas click on okay and that shows\nyou the public key let's copy the public\nkey from here let's go into our instance\nand I can give this here that resolves\nthe name so I have the private key saved\non my machine and public key which will\nbe pushed into the machine I can click\non Create and that should create my\ninstance to which you can connect using\nSSH from the console itself or using a\nexternal client such as puty which will\nthen need the public IP of this instance\nthe PPK file what we have and you can\nconnect to this instance what I can also\ndo is I can just to a simple SSH from\nhere and that will basically allow me to\nconnect to the instance what we also\nneed to remember is each instance what\nwe create in compute is also having some\ndefault firewall rules now I have\nconnected to my instance I can click on\nPudo Su I can log in as root and here if\nI would want I can install a particular\nservice so let's say Apache uh let's say\napt get install and then I can say\nApache 2 or\nhttpd that is basically to host your web\napplication so I'm installing the\nservice and here I can check if the\nservice is running by doing a service\nhttpd status or I can say service Apache\n2 status which says it is already\nrunning that means the Apache web server\npage will be accessible from HTTP\nprovided my firewall r R allow that now\nbefore we look into this we can also for\nour instance look at the firewall rules\nso here you have Network details now\nsince we created an instance by default\nGoogle has created some firewall rules\nwhich allow default HTTP\nhttps icmp your default internal access\nRDP and SSH access and here it says\nthese Ingress rules which allow incoming\ntraffic are allowed from anywhere we can\ncustomize that as specific IP addresses\nwe can also look at egress which is\nbasically outgoing traffic and this is\nagain saying my machine can connect to\nthe external World in different ways\nusing different protocols so you can\ncustomize these firewall rules as of now\nI'm going to let it be default now we\nconnected to our instance from the\nbrowser and we were basically checking\nhow you can use this browser by clicking\non this now what I can also do is here\nI'm logged into the instance my Apache\nserver is running so the best way to\ncheck if the Apache web server is\naccessible via HTTP all I need is my\npublic IP so let's copy this let's go\nhere and I will say\nHTTP SL slash just give your public IP\nand that shows your Apache to web server\npage that means the Apache service has\nalready been run now here it tells if\nyou would want to host a particular page\nwhat you will have to do is as it says\nhere it is based on equivalent page on\ndbn from which to Apache packaging is\nderived if you can read this page it\nmeans Apache HTTP server is installed at\nthis site is working properly now you\ncan replace this file located at VAR www\nHTM ml index.html before continuing to\noperate your HTTP server so this is\nwhere you can change the particular page\nand you will be able to host your\nwebsite on this particular E2 instance\nwhat we can do is we can check this so\nwe can go into the browser and we can\nlook in VAR\nwww and that has an HTML folder look\ninto this and as of now you have a index\n. HTML and that basically is the page\nwhat we are seeing now I can click on\nthis one and I can see I have a small\nHTML page which is basically showing me\nwhat we are seeing on our web server\nwhat I can also do is for now I can test\nit out and I can put in a different HTML\npage and see how that works so we had\nbasically the page here in VAR ww W and\nthen we had the HTML folder and in HTML\nfolder what I had was this index file so\nas of now I just moved it and I put it\nin a different location so if I look in\nmy home\nhdu\nindex.html that shows me the complete\nHTML page what we were seeing on our web\nserver and here it shows you what this\npage would display if you run it on your\nHT PTP it says Apache to window default\npage it shows it works it shows the\ncontent and so on so for just testing I\nmoved this page out from this location\nand what I did was I added a different\npage here so that page if you look in\nHTML and then look in my page. HTML\nsection I've just added some basic\ndetails of creating HTML I'm saying body\nI'm using Mari and then I'm closing this\nwith HTML tag now this is a simple HTML\npage which I created and now what I did\nwas once I've done this I basically did\na service Apache restart so once you do\nthat it will take up your new page and\nonce you have done that now you can\naccess that by going to your\nHTTP given your details and then\nbasically give your public IP which we\ncan get from\nhere and just paste it here now hit on\nthis so that shows me there is a my\npage. HTML I can click on this and that\nbasically shows the symbol page which I\ncreated so as of now this is my web page\nwhich I have created and this is hosted\non my compute instance now obviously we\ncan create a more complex website backed\nup by a database\nuse PHP use MySQL to store the data and\nthen host your website on a Google Cloud\nplatform service such as compute where\nyour actual code is running so we can\nlearn about your web hosting on compute\ninstances in further\nsessions are you in the analytic space\nHave you ever wondered how data\nprocessing in the cloud is changing
