  "text": "hello everyone welcome to this\ninteresting video on Google Cloud\nplatform full course in this video we\nwill explore and understand all the\nimportant Concepts revolving around\nGoogle Cloud platform starting with the\nbasics of what is gcp and its following\nconcepts like gcp domains comprising\nvarious services like compute storage\nnetworking iot Etc with a proper\nHands-On demonstration on these\nServices following that we will have a\ncomparison between gcp AWS and ashard\nand we'll see how they differ from each\nother and how they hold their\nindividuality and then at the end we\nwill understand some of its depth\nConcepts like gcp web hosting and gcp\nCloud\nemo and towards the end we will take you\nthrough gcp fundamentals and\ncertification training that will help\nyou gain the\ncertification so for this training with\nme I have our experienced gcp specialist\ntogether we will take you through the\nvarious important Keynotes of Google\nCloud\nplatform so let's start with with an\nexciting video on Google Cloud platform\nfull course before we begin make sure to\nsubscribe to our YouTube channel and hit\nthe Bell icon and never miss an update\nfrom Simply learn good morning and good\nevening everyone so welcome to this\nsession on Google Cloud platform my name\nis AJ and I'm an instructor with simply\nlearn and also working as a big data and\nCloud architect for various clients\nacross globe in this session we learn\nabout Google Cloud platform wherein we\nwill learn about what is cloud computing\nwhy Google Cloud platform what is gcp\nthat is Google Cloud platform Google\nCloud platform domains about a use case\nthat is ferero use case and also a quick\ndemo on using services from Google Cloud\nplatform so when we talk about Google\nCloud platform we also need to know what\nis cloud computing so cloud computing is\nthe use of hardware and software\ncomponents to deliver a service to a\nnetwork users can access these files and\napplications and services provided by a\ncloud provider from any device that has\naccess to Internet in short cloud\ncomputing is a way where cloud provider\nprovides access to different services\nsuch as resources and when we talk about\nresources here we talk about Computing\nwe talk about about memory we talk about\nprocessing power we talk about storage\nand we also talk about different\nServices which Cloud providers make\navailable for the users now that allows\nus for automatic software integration\nbackup and restoring data unlimited\nstorage capacity having a reliable use\nof different services and having a cost\nefficient solution now we know that\ncloud computing models there are\ndifferent service models so you have\nplatform as a service you have\ninfrastructure as a service and you have\nsoftware as a service and these are the\nprominent models which are offered by\ndifferent Cloud providers such as Google\nCloud such as Google you have Amazon you\nhave Azure and also some organizations\nbuild their own private clouds using\nopen Source open stack let's focus more\non Google Cloud platform and what it has\nto offer and how it is gaining\npopularity in the market with different\norganizations which would want to work\non a cloud platform or which would want\nto work on an infrastructure which is\nmodernized so when we talk about cloud\ncomputing this is one of the approach\nwhich organizations can take to instant\nmously benefit from modernization using\ndifferent Services different platforms\nand also newer Technologies for their\nvarious requirements such as scalability\nor dynamic businesses before we get into\nGoogle Cloud platform it is also good to\nunderstand where you can find some\nuseful resources about Google Cloud\nplatform and here you have a website\nwhich is from your Google Cloud so this\nis cloud\nacademy.com librarygoogle and here you\ncan create a free account now that would\ngive you just 7 days trial but that has\na lot of videos which talk about your\nGoogle Cloud platform and Essentials and\nit has various certification related\nvideos which you can access and then\nafter 7 days after you have tried you\ncan obviously go for a paid account\nwhere you can take detailed learning\nfrom here now this is your training\nLibrary which shows your different Cloud\nproviders such as Amazon Microsoft asure\ngcp and then you have various other\ntopics which are specifics to\norganization you can obviously look at\nthe pricing and you can also look at\nresources which will give you a good\nexperience in learning from these videos\nyou can also create a free account which\nI will walk you through later so you can\ncreate a free account on\ncloud.google.com now when I say free\naccount that basically means it allows\nyou to create an account and every user\nwho creates an account gets a $300 free\ncredit which can be used to practice\nbrush up your skills and also explore\nand learn about different Google Cloud\nproducts which are offered by Google now\ncoming back to our Google Cloud plat\nplatform let's understand why Google\nCloud platform so Google Cloud platform\nis popular for many reasons now let us\nsee few of most important reasons why it\nstands out when you talk about pricing\npricing is one of the significant\nfactors that make Google Cloud Stand Out\nAmong the other Cloud\nproviders it offers a monthly pricing\nplan which is build according to monthly\nusage and when we talk about billing\nhere the billing can can be in hours it\ncan be in minutes and it can also be in\nseconds there are different options when\nyou talk about your pricing which can be\nfound from your Google Cloud web page\nnow pricing could be based on preemptive\nmachines pricing could be based on\nreserved instances or reserved resources\nI'll show you the link where you can\nfind more details on pricing part of it\nso Google Cloud really has various\npricing options which help customers in\ntheir different requirements whether\nthey would go for any of the service\nmodels such as infrastructure as a\nservice platform as a service or even\nsoftware as a service one more\nattractive thing about Google Cloud\npricing is that it provides committed\nuse discounts for example under this\nscheme you can purchase a specific\namount of virtual CPU course and memory\nfor up to 57% discount off regular\nprices if you commit usage for either\none or 3 years now this is just one\noption there are various such options\nwhich you can learn about from the\nGoogle Cloud's page and that really\nsuits different customers for their\ndifferent\nrequirements now when we talk about\nspeed we don't need to really challenge\nthis aspect when it comes to Google\nservices so Google provides its Google\ncloud and Google app customer speed up\nto 10 tbyt because of its faster cable\nsystem there are different kind of\nmachines which can be used if you're\ntalking about computation if you're\ntalking about memory hungry applications\nor even storage intensive workloads all\nin all speed is one of the defining\ncharacteristics of Google cloud services\nthe cable has connections over us West\nCoast main cities in Japan\nand even major hubs in Asia this speed\nenhances performances and leads to\ncustomer satisfaction now when we talk\nabout customers any or every customer\nwould prefer to have low latency High\nthroughput Based Services they would\nwant to use higher speeds to process\ntheir data in as less time as possible\nGoogle provides a low latency Network\ninfrastructure in fact you can say that\nwhen you are using Google cloud services\nyou are using the services from the same\ninfrastructure which Google uses for its\npopular services such as Google search\nor even YouTube which is one of the\nsecond largest repository which can be\naccessed for videos now when we talk\nabout Big Data big data is data which is\nvery complex has lot of other\ncharacteristics such as your volume you\nhave velocity you have variety you have\nveracity validity volatility virality\nand so on so if an organization has is\nworking on Big Data Google Cloud can be\na better choice because Google has many\nInnovative tools for cloud warehousing\nfor example such as big query and even\nrealtime data processing tools such as\ndata flow big query is a data warehouse\nthat allows massive processing of data\nat high speeds basically working on your\nstructured data Google also has launched\nsome new machine learning from\nartificial intelligence tools now there\nare various other services which we can\nwhich we can use from Google Cloud\nplatform but let's understand what is\nGoogle Cloud platform and what are some\nof the services even the services which\nare not listed here can be found in your\nconsole from Google Cloud so what is\nGoogle Cloud platform gcp it is a set of\nCloud Computing Services provided by\nGoogle that runs on the same\ninfrastructure as I mentioned that\nGoogle uses for its end user products\nlike YouTube Gmail and even Google\nsearch the various set of services\noffered by Google Cloud platform are so\nyou have Services which are specific to\nComputing requirements and again in\nComputing you have various different\noptions available you have machines\nwhich are compute optimized machines\nwhich are memory optimized machines\nwhich are storage optimized and also we\nhave certain machines such as preff\nwhich basically means that you could get\na machine to work on at a far lesser\nprice than any other machine but when we\ntalk about preemptive these are the\nmachines which can be requested on\ndemand and they can be taken back by\nGoogle at any time you have networking\nrelated Services which can be very\nuseful when you are setting up your\napplications or your services across\nGlobe you also have different Services\nwhich are specific to machine learning\nand organizations which would be\ninterested in working on machine\nlearning or artificial intelligence\nwould be really interested in using\nthese Services there are also innovative\nsolutions to work on big data and Big\nData related Technologies now when we\ntalk about Google Cloud platform domains\nso we can break down these Services into\nspecifics such as you have compute now\nthe compute service allows for computing\nand hosting the cloud now when you talk\nabout Computing here there are different\nservices such as app engine you have\ncompute engine you have kubernetes you\nhave Cloud functions and Cloud run when\nyou talk about storage and database so\nthe storage and database service allows\napplication to store media files backups\nor other filik objects now various\nServices Under This are as follows you\nhave cloud storage Cloud SQL Cloud big\ntable for unstructured data you have\nCloud spanner cloud data store\npersistent Diss and Cloud memory store\nwhen we talk about networking the\nnetworking service allows us to load\nbalance traffic across resources now as\nI mentioned earlier resources could be\nyour different resources which you would\nbe using from a cloud platform such as\nyour devices your instances memory\noptimized or CPU optimized instances or\nother resources creating DNS records and\nmuch more so various Services Under This\nare VPC that stands for virtual private\nCloud you have Cloud load balancing\nCloud armor Cloud CDN you have Cloud\ninterconnect DNS and network service te\nwhen we talk about the big data service\nthis allows us to process and query big\ndata in Cloud now various Services under\nthese are as follows you have big query\ncloud cloud data proc Cloud composer\ncloud data lab cloud data prep Cloud Pub\nsub which is publish and subscribing\nsystem you have cloud data studio now\nyou also have the developer tools and\ndeveloper Tools service includes tools\nrelated to development of an application\nnow various Services under these are as\nfollows that is you have Cloud SDK\nsoftware development kit you have\ndeployment manager Cloud Source\nrepositories and Cloud test lab when we\ntalk about identity and security which\nis one of the primary concerns for any\norganization or any user who would be\ninterested in using a cloud platform\nGoogle Cloud really has taken care of\nthis so when you talk about identity and\nsecurity domain this deals with Security\nServices now various Services here are\nCloud identity you have identity and\naccess management that is cloud am you\nhave identity aware proxies you have\ncloud data loss prevention API security\nkey enforcement key Management Service\nand many more you also have cloud\nservices which are related to internet\nof things so very much would be used by\norganizations who would be working on\niot devices or the data generated by\nthese devices so various Services here\nare Cloud iot Core you have Edge TPU and\nCloud iot also when we talk about Cloud\nAI that is artificial intelligence this\ncomprises of services related to machine\nlearning and much more so you have Cloud\nautom ml Cloud TPU Cloud machine\nlearning engine job Discovery dialog\nflow Enterprise natural language Cloud\ntext to speech and much more if you\nwould be interested in Services related\nto API platform then there are different\nServices Under This category or this\ndomain so you have Maps platform you\nhave APG API platform\nmonetization developer portal analytics\nthat is API analytics APG sense Cloud\nendpoints and service infrastructure so\nthese are some of the listing of\nservices under each Cloud platform\ndomain now let's look at Ferrero use\ncase and let's also understand what was\ndone here so ferero is one of the famous\nchocolate and ranks third among\nworldwide chocolate and confectionary\nproducers it was found in 1946 in Italy\nI'm sure you would have seen the ferero\nchocolates when you would have gone out\nto buy some chocolates so the challenges\nhere was that ferero as we know is sold\nin every supermarket and is known for\nits quality once the business grew some\nissues arrows right and that's what\nhappens when the business grows you have\nissues popping up which could be related\nto the volume of data the speed with\nwhich the data is getting generated the\nvariety of data and also looking at your\nplatforms which support different\nDynamic applications or your scalability\nrequirements performance requirements\nand so on so it needed data storage\nprocessing and Analysis system for a\nwide customer database there was a huge\ngap between the company and the people\nwho bought its goods because the company\nrelied on data given sales outlets now\nthat's one of the challenge Ferrero\nwanted to create a digital ecosystem\nwhere there was a point of contact with\nits customers and also a foundation for\nan Innovative datadriven marketing\nstrategy what was the solution here so\none of the service of cloud platforms or\nGoogle Cloud platform is Big query and\nthis was an answer to fero's challenges\nsince it was capable of hyper fast and\nefficient data analysis as a solution\nnow as I mentioned big query is a data\nwarehouse which allows you to store\nstructured data now this could directly\nbe used as a service where you could\nstore in any amount of data and you\nwould not be paying for storage so there\nare different pricing models and for\ndata up to 1 terabytes you would not be\ncharged anything and if you would be\naccessing the data that is reading the\ndata or processing the data from\nbigquery that's where the pricing model\nkicks in now using Google Cloud's big\nquery business analysts of ferero were\nable to store and analyze massive data\nsets in a very reliable fast and\naffordable\nmanner consumer behavior and sales\npattern data reports were easy to build\nand\nautomate and and the analysis also\nfollowed ferero to adopt advertising\nacross various marketing channels to\nserve the customer needs in a better way\nwhat was the result they could divide\ntheir database into realtime actionable\nconsumer clusters to generate more\naccurate user profiles fero was also\nable to personalize its marketing\nstrategies to match the user needs now\nGoogle Cloud platform completely\ntailored the website mobile content and\nadvertising and created a very\ncosteffective media by strategy now\nthese were some Basics on Google Cloud\nnow as I said you can always find lot of\ndetails about pricing about services and\nalso all the services are accessible in\nyour free trial account now let me just\nwalk you through here so one is you\ncould always find Details on\ndocumentation on each of these services\nso if I would click on getting started\nyou have quick start which basically\nshows you short tutorials you have\ntrainings and you have also\ncertifications now if we click on quick\nstart now that takes me to this page\nwhich shows me quick starts or if you\nwould want to understand about different\nprojects if you would want to look into\nthe documentation of creating a Linux\nwhat ual machine or storing a file and\nsharing it deploying a container Docker\ncontainer image and so on so you have a\nlot of quick starts here you can also\nlook at Cloud\nminute on the same page on the right\nside you have docs and once you click on\nthat it takes you to these links now\nthis shows you build Solutions which\nshows you top use cases best practices\nall the solutions it's always good to\nlearn from these use cases which are\navailable and here\nyou have different feature products and\nall the different Services which Google\nCloud offers now you can click on\nfeatured products and that basically\nshows you a list of these products now\nhere we have all the solutions which you\ncan look at architecture database\nEnterprise level big data and Analysis\ngaming related internet of things and so\non now if you go down here it shows you\nfeatured products and that shows you\nsome of the important products such as\ncompute engine which is belonging to the\ncompute domain you have Cloud run you\nhave anthers which is for\nmigration and basically Cloud adoption\nwhen organizations would want to move\nfrom on premise to cloud-based Solutions\nyou have Vision AI you have cloud\nstorage now that basically allows you to\nstore any kind of data whether that's an\nobject so this is acting as an object\nstorage you have cloudsql which is basic\nbasically a ready to use service where\nyou would be using MySQL post or any\nother SQL Server database Services you\nhave big query which is a data warehouse\nwhich basically allows you to store your\nstructured data and then you have your\nAI and machine learning related products\nso you have automl Vision AI video AI\ntext to speech speech to text and so on\nnow you also have different platform\naccelerators which can be used and in\nany of these cases for example if I\nwould click on compute engine which is a\nfeatured product from Google Cloud now\nthat shows you basically your quick\nstarts using your Linux machines how to\nguides which tells you completely\nworking on a VM instance or working on\nstorage working on persistent Diss and\nso on and it shows you the documentation\nhere now you also have products and\npricing option\nwhich you can see for GCB pricing and\nyou could straight away go to the\npricing you could be looking at\nSolutions which talks about\ninfrastructure modernization now this is\nsomething which organizations are\ninterested in when they would want to\nmove from their on premise solution to\nyour Google Cloud now here I can say for\nexample I click on infrastructure\nmodernization you can always find some\ncase studies what are the different\nsolutions we have here right when you\ntalk about Google Cloud so you can\nalways click on C Solutions and you can\nlook at VM migration or SCP Cloud right\nby Google Cloud what it can be used for\nVMware as a service or HBC that is high\nperformance Computing and about these\nServices we will learn in detail later\nnow I can go back on the same page where\nI was clicking on the services so you\nhave quick starts you have how to guides\nyou have deep understanding of different\nconcepts right and here if I click on\nall how to guides so that shows me what\nare the different ways in which you can\nwork with compute engine and working\nwith different instances although it's\nquite exhaustive content but then if you\nfollow steadily then you can learn a lot\nabout Google Cloud now here I can just\ngo back so this is just giving you some\nidea on the different products which are\navailable from Google Cloud looking into\ndifferent sections finding right\ndocumentation here right and you can\nalways look into each one of these in\ndetail for each product which Google\nCloud\noffers now if we scroll down we could\nsee all the options or all the domains\nwhich we see here right let me just go\nback because we got into Solutions now\nwe have quick starts right and and then\nyou can basically scroll all the way\ndown to look at Cloud SDK which can be\nset up on your Windows machine like I\nhave set it up on my Windows machine\nplus when you use Google console you\nhave a GUI which I'll show you in couple\nof minutes and also a cloud shell where\nyou can use your command line options to\nwork with Google Cloud platform you have\nCloud console which is nothing but your\nGUI to access your resources\nnow you can also look at in-depth\ntutorials pricing and you have different\nother options so let's just click on\npricing here and then we have your price\nlist which basically gives you details\nof different Services what are available\nand what are the services or what are\nthe prices so for example if I click on\ncomputer engine right and this shows me\nthe pricing aspect of compute engine\nwhich belongs to compute domain and and\nhere you can see you have VM instance\npricing you have networking pricing sold\ntenant noes which are specific to\nparticular organizations or if\norganizations would want to have\ndedicated nodes you have GPU based\npricing right so General processing\nunits you have dis and image pricing and\nyou can click on any of the links and\nyou can see pricing which also shows you\nyour different kind of machine types so\nhere you have different kind of machine\ntypes which says N1 N2 N2 D E2 you have\nmemory optimized machine types you have\ncompute optimized you have premium\nimages and you can basically look at all\nthe categories you can look at disk\npricing which involves your persistent\ndisk pricing for ssds or sgds what are\nthe kind of images what are the\ndifferent network Services right and you\ncan always look at your machine types\nyou can choose a particular region right\nthere is the concept of region and\navailability zones here and as per\nregion you could look at the prices you\ncan also look at standard prices you\ncould be looking for what are the free\ntier machines if I'm specifically\nlooking for VM instance pricing I can\nclick on this one and that takes me to\nthe VM instance pricing what is the\nbilding module what is the instance up\ntime what is the resource based pricing\nand then you can also look at different\nkind of discounts such as sustained use\ndiscounts committed use discounts\ndiscounts for preemptable FM instances\nand so on and this is how you can be\nlooking at pricing for all different\nresources and you can choose the\nresource which you are interested in and\nthen look for the pricing benchmarks\nreservations if you would want to use\nand you would want to benefit if you\nwould want to look at what are the\nquotas and limits and so on so please\nexplore this link and you can find lot\nof information when it comes to\ntechnical options looking at different\ndifferent Google Cloud products which we\nbriefly discussed when it comes to\ndomains and what each product can be\nused for you can always come back to the\nmain page where I was showing you\ndifferent Services we went into pricing\nstraight away right now you can always\ncome back to this page on your\ncloud.google.com and then you have your\nSolutions which talks about different\nproducts right and you can click on\nthese or you can look into technical\ndocumentation so this talks about your\ndifferent featured Solutions\ninfrastructure Solutions you have data\ncenter migration related and so on so I\ncould be talking more and more about\nGoogle Cloud platform it's a ocean it's\na huge chunk of different services for\ndifferent organizational requirements so\nlook into this link and also what you\ncan do is create a account on Gmail I\nmean you could create a free account or\nyou could go to cloud.google.com\nand then you could create a free account\nlike I have created here and I can just\nclick on Console now that's my GUI or\nGoogle Cloud console which basically\nallows me to work with Google Cloud now\nthere are a lot of options here by\ndefault when you create an account now\nin my case on the top it says it's a\nfree trial account I have $300 credit\nand out of that $251 is left and 237\ndays out of a year are left for my\naccount now here I can basically see the\nproject right and by default we can\ncreate an project or by default there is\na project existing for any user so when\nyou login it creates a particular\nproject and you could create a new\nproject and project would be to dedicate\nyour different services or different\nresources per different project so this\nis your dashboard which basically shows\nyour project which shows you a project\nnumber and a project ID which is always\nunique now you can click on this and\nthis if you would want you can hide this\ninformation you can also look into the\ndocumentation part of it then it shows\nyou the different services or a\ngraphical information of services which\nyou might have used in past so you have\ncompute engine which shows you how much\npercentage of CPU was used you can\nalways go to compute engine as a service\nyou can look at your Google Cloud plat\nform status and look at the Google Cloud\nstatus now this is billing now since\nthis shows me the billing period for\nApril month and I can always look at\ndetail charges I can look at reporting I\ncan look at different apis which Google\noffers and for your different kind of\nwork you can always go to the API\noverview or the API link and enable or\ndisable any API now once you enable or\ndisable any API then you can use that so\nyou have news section you have\ndocumentation and you have getting\nstarted guides which tells you how to\nwork or enable different apis if you\nwould want to deploy a pre-build\nsolution at Dynamic logging monitoring\nerrors deploying a Hello World app and\nso on now this is your dashboard I can\nclick on activity and that would show me\nwhat kind of activity I would have done\nin my cloud platform I can always choose\nthe kind of activities by saying\nactivity type I can choose the resources\nnow it shows me that I created some VM\ninstances I deleted them I updated some\nmetadata I basically worked on instances\nI changed some firewall rules here I\nhave then also worked on some other\nservices or apis so I created some\nbuckets which is for object storage and\nagain I have been working with some\ninstances and creating some firewall\nrules here I have granted some\npermissions I am setting up a policy\nright so this activity gives me a\nhistory of what things I have done over\nthe past couple of months while working\non Google Cloud platform now on the top\nleft corner you have the hamburger menu\nwhich you can click on this so that's\nyour navigation menu and when you click\non this this shows you home it takes\ntakes you to the marketplace it\nspecifically takes you to billing you\ncan always look at apis and services so\nhere in API Services I can pretty much\ngo to a dashboard and I can see a report\non the traffic or errors or latency and\nthe kind of apis which are available so\nyou have compute engine API you have big\nquery API big query data transfer API\nbig query storage cloud data proc so\nthese are some of the apis or Services\nI've used in p\nmight be I was evaluating a product\nmight be I was using a particular\nproduct so you have whenever you would\nwant to use a particular service from\nGoogle Cloud platform you would be\nenabling these apis so here we see some\napis for data proc you have logging\nmonitoring you have resource manager API\nyou have cloudsql which allows you to\ndirectly use MySQL or postgress you have\ncloud storage right and so many apis so\nif I would want to enable a particular\nAPI which is not right now required but\nthen it's good to know you can always\nclick on this one you can search for an\nAPI so for example if I would say data\nproc right and that shows me the cloud\ndata proc API which manages Hadoop based\nclusters and jobs on Google Cloud\nplatform so I can spin up a Hadoop\ncluster and I can start running some\njobs on a Hadoop cluster on demand and\nas I'm done with it I can just get rid\nof of it so this is an API which I would\nhave to enable and then for every\nparticular service you also have an\nadmin API which you would enable now\ngoing back so coming out from this API\nLibrary I got into API and services now\nthere is you can look into the library\nyou can look at credentials and you can\nalso look at different time intervals\nfor which you can see the usage of your\ndifferent apis now going back to the\nmenu you have support wherein you can\nalways reach out to the Google support\nteam if you are using a paid version\neven with free trial you can try to\nreach out and you will find someone to\nhelp but it is always good when you have\na billing cycle reaching out the\ncustomer care you have identity access\nmanagement in admin and this is required\nwhen you're working with different apis\nor Services when you would want to have\nrelevant access you have getting started\nyou have security related options you\nhave anthos which is mainly for\nmigration now here you can look at your\ndifferent domains such as which we\ndiscussed so you have compute and in\ncompute you have different services so\nyou have app engine you have compute\nengine kubernetes you have Cloud\nfunctions and Cloud run you can look\ninto the storage aspect which shows you\nbig table which is usually and mainly\nfor your unstructured data big table\nwhich is something which gave rise to\npopular nosql databases like hbas and\ncassendra you have data store which can\nbe used you have fire store file store\nstorage which can be used to put in data\nof any kinds you have SQL for structured\ndata you have spanner as a service you\nhave memory store and you have data\ntransfer now when it comes to the\nnetworking domain you have all these\nservices such as VPC virtual private\nnetwork network related services for\nyour load balancing for using a\ncloud-based DNS or Cloud defined Network\nyou have hybrid connectivity network\nservice tis security and intelligence\nthen you have other options for your\noperations which can be used and here\nyou have different other tools which can\nbe used such as Cloud build you have\nCloud tasks container registry\ndeployment manager and many more big\ndata specific you have the services here\nso you have data proc which can be used\nto spin up your clusters you have\npublished subscribe messaging system\nsuch as now Kafka which you might have\nheard of originates its idea from here\nso Pub sub you have data flow you have\niot core big query which is a data\nwarehouse package or data warehousing\nsolution from Google Cloud now then you\nhave your artificial intelligence\nrelated services and other Google\nSolutions so you can always find a huge\nlist of services or you can say at high\nlevel Solutions offered by Google cloud\nand we can use these to basically test\nsome of the solutions use them and work\non them so I'll give you a quick demo on\ndifferent Services which can be used\nhere from your Google Cloud platform now\nthis is your Google Cloud platform and\nthis is your console now this also gives\nyou a cloud shell which can be activated\nso that you can work from command line\nand you can always find lot of\ndocumentation on that so you can also\nset up your Cloud shell that is SDK on\nyour Windows machine and if you have set\nit up then basically you could be doing\nsomething like gcloud right if the cloud\nhas been set up so in my case I had set\nup the cloud SDK and basically I can get\ninto that by looking at what path I have\nset up so Cloud SDK and then I can be\nusing using it from my Windows machine\nas per my comfort I can also activate\nthe cloud shell here which will\nbasically open up a terminal and at any\npoint of time you can open up this one\nCloud shell in a different window it is\npreparing the cloud shell where it will\nby default set up your project it will\nset up the metadata and now I am logged\ninto my Google Cloud account from\ncommand line and here I can basically\nuse gcloud right and that basically\nshows you the different options which\nare available which you can be using so\nif you would want to use a particular\nservice you can also try giving a help\nand that shows you how do you manage\nyour Google Cloud platform right so you\nhave different options for billing to\nwork with your different services and\nbasically you could be working on Google\nCloud using this Cloud shell from your\ncommand line usually for people who are\nlearning Google cloud in the beginning\nit is always is good to go for console\nand use your different services from\nhere in an easier way but as I said you\ncan always use the command line for\nexample if I would just go ahead and\ntype\ngcloud create\ninstances and that will directly take me\nto the cloud console documentation which\nshows you different options which you\ncan use to work with instances so I\ncould do a g-cloud compute instances\ncreate and then I can give my instance\nname and so on and I'll show you some\nexamples on that so you can be using\nyour Cloud console right that is your\nCloud shell and you can straight away\nstart working from command line however\nI would suggest using console in the\nbeginning and when you are well\nexperienced then you can start using\nCloud shell to do things from command\nline and when you are fully experienced\nyou can always switch and certain things\nare usually useful or easier when done\nfrom command line and some are are\neasier when you do it from the console\nand you can use any one of these options\nnow we can go to Google Cloud console\nnow as of now I can close this one I\nstill have my cloud shell open if I\nwould want to look into it I can click\non this one and I can straight away go\nto compute engine where I would want to\nwork on creating some instances on\nGoogle Cloud platform using the compute\nengine service and then basically\nconnecting to those instances and and\nbasically trying out some basic things\nso you can click on VM instances and\nthen once this comes up I can always\ncreate some instances now if you see\nhere I have some instances already\ncreated right and I can continue working\non those I can create new instances I\ncan use different options while creating\ninstances and I'll show you that in a\ndemo in quick seconds so let's have a\nquick demo on setting up gcp instances\nnow before that let's have a quick recap\nso when you talk about instance or a\nvirtual machine it is hosted on Google\ninfrastructure right and you can create\nyour Google Cloud instance using this\nGoogle Cloud console that is by clicking\non this and then going to compute engine\nand clicking on VM instances now you can\nalso do that from Google Cloud command\nline tool that is cloud shell and you\ncan be doing that using compute engine\nAPI so compute engine instances can run\nthe public images for Linux or Windows\nservers that Google provides you also\nhave option of creating or using custom\nimages that you can create an import\nfrom your existing systems you can\ndeploy Docker containers which are\nautomatically launched on instance\nrunning containers optimized OS now when\nyou talk about instances and projects\nalways remember that in each instance\nbelongs to a Google Cloud console\nproject and a project can have one or\nmore\ninstances when you talk about instances\nand storage options each instance has a\nsmall boot persistent disk which I will\nshow you in further screens that\ncontains the OS you can add more storage\nspace if needed and when you talk about\ninstances and network a project can have\nup to five VP C networks so VPC network\nis virtual private networks wherein you\ncan virtual private Cloud networks where\nyou can have your resources within your\nown subnet and each instance belongs to\none VPC Network now instances in same\nnetwork can communicate with each other\nthrough local area network protocol an\ninstance uses internet to communicate\nwithin any machine so that could be\nvirtual physical or outside its own\nnetwork when you talk about instances\nand containers you should remember that\ncompute engine instances support a\ndeclarative method for launching your\napplication using containers now you can\ncreate a VM instance or a VM instance\ntemplate you can provide a Docker image\nand launch the configuration so there\nare different ways in which you can\ncreate these instances and once you\ncreate these instances you can say for\nexample you're creating a Linux instance\nyou can associate SSH keys with your\nGoogle account or your G Suite account\nand then manage your admin non-admin\naccess to the instance using IM roles if\nyou connect to your instance using\ngcloud or SSH from console which we will\nsee later compute engine can generate\nSSH keys for you and apply that to your\nGoogle cloud or G Suite account now what\nwe can do is we can see how we can\ncreate your Google Cloud instances from\nyour console or from the command line\nlet's have a look in creating instances\nusing GCB console now that we have\nlearned on some basics of Google Cloud\nplatform what are the different Services\nwhat are different domains basically\nlooking at your Google Cloud console or\neven Cloud Shell let's go ahead and\ncreate some VM instances now that's from\nyour compute engine service and let's\ntry connecting to these instances and\nsee how this works let's also see what\nare the different options which are\navailable when you would want to create\nthe virtual machine instances here so\nwhen you click on your drop down from\nthe top left and choose compute engine\nso it brings you to this page so I can\nshow that again so you can click on\ncompute engine click on VM instances and\nthat basically brings you to this page\nnow here it tells you compute engine\nlets you use Virtual machines that run\non Google's infrastructure so we can\ncreate microv VMS or large instances\nrunning different distributions of Linux\nor Windows using standard images that is\npublic images and you can also have your\nown image so let's create a VM instance\nby clicking on create now that's\nbasically helping me to create an\ninstance here so it shows me the\ninstance name I can give it some things\nso let me say C1 now I can add labels so\nwhat is label it basically allows you to\norganize your project add arbitrary\nlabels as key value pairs to your\nresources this so this is basically\ncategorizing your labels in projectss if\nyou have multiple projects now remember\nif you have your Cloud console and if\nyou have created your free trial account\nit will allow you to do these things if\nnot you may have to go back to the\nbilling section and see if the bill is\nenabled which also means that when you\nare creating your Google Cloud account\nit will ask you to ke your credit card\ndetails but they do not charge anything\nor they might charge might be $1 or one\nrupee depending on your location and\nthat's also refunded but that's just to\nverify your card now once I've given the\nname I can choose a region so I would\nbasically choose Europe since I'm in\nEurope I would be clicking on Europe\nWest 3 and here I can choose an\navailability Zone availability zone is\nbasically to make your services or\ninstances or any other resources highly\navailable so you can choose one of the\navailability zones now I would choose\nsavs 3 now this one we can scroll down\nand here it says machine configurations\nyou have general purpose machines you\nhave memory optimized machines which is\nM1 series and you can always go back to\nthe Google Cloud page and see what a\nparticular kind of machines specializes\nin so I would click on General's purpose\nand in general purpose you have\ndifferent categories so you have N1\nwhich is powered by Intel Skylake CPU\nplatform or you have E2 which is CPU\nplatform selected selection based on\navailability so let's have N1 selected\nnow this one shows me the machine type\nand if you are using your free tier\naccount then you can start with\ncorrecting a micro machine which is one\nvirtual CPU core you can you can go for\na G1 small which is one virtual CPU code\nand 1.7 GB Ram you can even go up to a\nhigh-end machine and then you can\nbasically see if you're using a free\naccount how many of these machines you\ncan use if I would be selecting eight\nvirtual CPU CES and 32 gab of memory\nthen it would allow me to create at\nleast two instances by this\nconfiguration we will use N1 standard\nwhich is one virtual CPU core 3.75 GB\nmemory now then we can also deploy a\ncontainer image to this VM instance if\nyou would be interested in deploying a\ncontainer image let's not get into that\nright now here it shows you the boot dis\nand it shows you dbn gnu 9 Linux 9 what\nI would do is I can go for this\ndistribution or I can choose a Linux\ndistribution of my choice so here you\nhave public images you have custom\nimages you also have snapshots if you\nhave created backup of your previous\nimages here I can choose for example\nubben 2 and then I can choose a\nparticular version so let's go for to\n18.04 you can go for the latest one also\n18.04 would be good enough and here it\ntells me what is a boot dis so you have\nssds or you have standard persistent\ndiscs now ssds are little expensive in\ncomparison to your standard persistent\ndiscs or your sdds but then ssds are FAS\nso as of now we can choose standard\npersistent disk as it is and we can let\nthe gigabyte be 10 now depending on your\nrequirement you can increase this you\ncan even add diss later that's not a\nproblem click on select now here I have\naccess Scopes so here I will say allow\ndefault access you can also set access\nfor each API or you can give full access\nto all Cloud API so that BAS Bas on your\nrequirement you can anytime change later\nalso we will also say allow sttp traffic\nand we can also choose allow https\ntraffic that basically allows me to\naccess this machine or Services which\nare HTTP based accessible from this\nmachine now I can just click on create\nhowever it would be good to basically\nenable connectivity to this machine now\nwe can do that in different ways one is\nwhen you bring up your machine it will\nhave an SSH access ACC which you can log\nin from the cloud platform here itself\nor what you can do is you can create a\nprivate and a public key using some\nsoftwares like puty or puty gen so for\nexample if you do not have that on your\nmachine you can download you can just\ntype in download puty that takes you to\nthe putty. org page and here you can\nclick on download puty and scroll down\nwhich shows you for your 64-bit machine\nwhich I have in my case you can download\nputty.exe which is basically your SSH\nandet client to connect to your machines\nyou can also use puty gen which will be\nallowing you to create a private and a\npublic key which I have done in my case\nlet me show you how so what you can do\nis you can go to puty gen to begin with\nand here you can click on generate now\nthen to have this key generated just\nmove your cursor on the top here in the\nempty space and that creates your key\nyou can give it a name so for example\nlet's give a username I would give hdu\nnow I can give a password for this one\nso let me give a simple\npassword and what I can also do is I can\ncopy this public key from here and for\nmy later usage I can just keep it in my\nnotepad file which I can use later and\nI'll show you when so now we can save\nthis private key and this will basically\nallow me to save my private key I can\nchoose desktop and I can give it a name\nso let's say new key new key and that\nwill be getting saved in a PPK file so\nlet's save it and that's done so we also\nhave our public key and we have saved\nour private key now we know that when\nyou would want to connect using SSH you\nneed your private keys to the client and\npublic key also has to be existing so\nlet's take this public key so so let's\ndo a contr a I'm going to copy this and\nI'm going to come back to my Google\nCloud console and here you can click on\nsecurity so you can click on the\nsecurity tab here scroll down and just\ngive your public key once you give that\nit resolves and shows you the name and\nthis is good enough so that I can use my\nSSH client to connect to this machine I\ncan click on Create and this will\nbasically create my VM instance it will\ntake some time and then your instance\nwill have an internal IP which will show\nup here external IP and it will also\nshow you options to connect to these\nmachines so this is my internal IP this\nis my external IP which I can use to\nconnect from a client I can easily\nconnect from the option here which says\nSSH and I can say open in a browser\nwindow I can even open this in a custom\nPort I can look at the g-cloud command\nwhich you can give from cloud shell or\nyou can use another SSH so let's first\ndo a open in browser window and let's\nsee if this connects so we can easily\nconnect to our instance the UB 28\ninstance which I just set up here easily\nin couple of seconds now this is trying\nto establish a connection using your SSH\nkeys and when you do that it also\nbasically brings up this web browser so\nI'm already connected it shows my\nusername which is my cloud account\naccount username and I have been\nconnected to this machine here using SSH\nit did not ask me for any password and\nbasically now I can just check what do I\nhave in my Linux file system right and I\ncan anytime log in as rout by doing a\npseudo Su for example let's try\ninstalling a package and I can say app\nget install whm or AP get install WG get\nor app get install open SS edch and all\nthese packages are already existing so\nnot an issue now I can start using this\ninstance I can just look at the disk\nwhat is available okay now we gave\naround 10 GB out of which we see 8.3 GB\nhere for the dev SDA 1 and then 1.8 GB\navailable and you can continue using\nthis machine this was the easiest way of\nconnecting to a VM instance using\nSSH now what we can also do is I can\njust leave this and I will now try to\nconnect using an external SSH client\nright and here you can copy the public\nIP so when you want to connect to an\ninstance you will have to get the public\nIP also remember that if you select and\nstop this machine which will stop your\nbilling counter and if you start it\nagain the internal IP will remain same\nbut the external IP is the one which\nwill change I can obviously select this\nmachine anytime and I can do a cleanup\nand I can delete it I can do a start of\nthe machine if it is stopped and I can\neven import the virtual machine to be\nused later so there are different\noptions which you can always use so this\nis my instance and if you would want to\nlook at the details click on this one C1\nand that should basically allow you to\nlook at the details so it shows you what\nis the instance ID what is the machine\ntype is it reservation specific what is\nthe CPU platform what's the zone and all\nthe other details at any point of time\nif you would want to edit you can always\nclick on edit and you can change the\ndetails as you need now you can also\nlook at the equivalent rest command to\nbasically use the rest API to connect to\nthis instance for now I have copied the\npublic IP and I would want to connect it\nusing puty so let's go in here and let's\ngive it the host name so I can give ubu\nI can give my IP address so that's in my\nsession now I will click on SSH I would\ngo into authentication I'll click on\nbrowse and this is where I need to\nchoose the PPK file so this is the one\nwhich we created new key let's select\nthis and then I can come back to session\nI can even save this and I can call it\nas my instance one let's save it and you\ncan create any number of instances so\nyou see I have created different\ninstances here for my Google cloud or\nAmazon related instances and I can click\non open it says the service host key is\nnot cast in the registry that's fine\njust click on yes and basically it says\nno authentication method supported now\nthis could be because we have not\nenabled your SSH access so let's look at\nthat so now let's see if we were trying\nto connect using puty what was the issue\nhere so if I go back to my puty select\nmy instance load it it says Port 22 I'm\ngiving the user name which is window or\nsorry that's the wrong username we gave\nand that might be the reason we had set\nup the user as sdu so let's save this\nagain and now let's try connecting to\nthis one and it asks for my password and\nyou are able to connect this right now\nif there was any other issue related to\nnetwork connectivity then we could look\nat the rules the inbound and outbound\nrules which allow us to look into the\nmachine now we are connected to our\nmachine here using hdu user I can log in\nas root and I can continue working so\nnot only from the SSH within the cloud\nconsole but you can use an external SSH\nclient and connect to your machine so\nthis is your wi to machine and we can\nbasically look at the space and that\nbasically confirms we are connecting to\nthe same machine machine which shows 8.3\nGB here and 1.8 GB here which we were\nseeing from the ssh in the browser now\nlet's close this and let's go back to\nour instance page now here you can\nalways look at the network details and\nthis will show you your different kind\nof rules that is ingress or egress rules\nwhich basically allows to connect to\nthis machine from an external network or\nfor this machine to connect to an\nexternal network so here we have\ndifferent firewall rules which shows\ndefault allow HTTP that's your Ingress\nRule and it tells you apply to all it\nshows me what are the IP ranges where I\ncan specifically give the IP of my\nmachine it shows the protocols it shows\nwhat are the different ports which you\nhave used for these services for example\nRDP or SSH which shows 22 you have icmp\nHTTP and https now anytime if you would\nwant to make a change to these rules\nthat can be done by going into your\nnetwork details and say for example you\nwould want to work on firewall rules so\nwe have these firewall rules here you\ncan click on this one so right now we\nare looking into the network domain and\nwe are looking into VPC Network right\nand this shows me what are the different\nrules we have now if I would want to\ncreate a different firewall rule for a\ndifferent protocol I can always click on\ncreate firewall rule I can give it a\nname okay I can say what if you would\nwant to turn all the firewall logs you\ncan basically say what is the kind of\ntraffic so Ingress applies to incoming\ntraffic and egress applies to outgoing\ntraffic and you can then basically\nchoose what are the IP ranges from where\nyou want that connection to be coming in\nor to going out you can choose a\nparticular protocol you can give a\nprotocol here with Comm ated values and\nyou can create a firewall rule so this\nmight be required depending on the\nservices which you are running wherein\nyou might want to enable your access to\nyour machine from an external service or\nto an external service so you can always\ngo to network details from here you can\nthen go into firewall rules create a\nfirewall rule apply that to your\ninstance and restart your instance so as\nof now we don't need to create any\nnetwork details here because my Ingress\nor egress rules are already available\nright now I can basically then have my\ninstance stopped and removed so I can\njust do a stop or since this is running\nthe ideal way would be to do a stop I\ncould also do a reset now what does\nreset do reset does not basically delete\nthe machine what it does is it does a\ncleanup of the machine and it brings it\nto the initial state so sometimes we\nmight have installed certain things on\nour machine we would want to clean them\nup and at that time reset can be useful\nI can basically click on delete right\nand I can select this and I can do a\ncleanup and this is good always when\nyou're are using a free trial account\ntry to use different Services play\naround with them and then you can clean\nup so that you do not waste your free\nbilling credit right and you can use it\nfor Meaningful stuff now I have clicked\non delete and within few seconds my\ninstance which I had created will be\ndeleted also to remember is if you are\ncreating multiple instances then you can\nconnect from one machine to other\nmachine using SSH by using the private\nfile so for that we can learn in detail\nlater so this is just a simple example\nof using your compute engine creating\nyour instances connecting to it from an\ninternal SSH or from an external SSH\nclient such as\nwhere you have already created your\nprivate and public Keys now I can click\non the browser here and then I can\nbasically come out and I can basically\nbe looking into any particular service\nso we just looked into compute engine\nright you have different other options\nyou have instance groups you have\ninstance templates for example let's\nclick on instance templates here and\nthat basically shows you that you don't\nhave any instance template and this\nbasically facilitates say for example\nexample you are working as a admin and\nyou would want to create an instance\ntemplate so that using that you can\ndescribe a VM instance and then you can\nbasically use this template to create\ndifferent instances you can go for soul\ntenant notes you can look for machine\nimages you can also look at your discs\nyou can create a snapshots and you can\nlook at different options here now let's\ncome back here and let's click on home\nand that should take you back to your\nhomepage page which basically shows you\nif a particular API which you have used\nrecently which shows me in the graph\nhere so I can go to the api's overview\nright and that basically shows me if\nthere were any errors if I was using the\ncompute engine API to basically create a\nVM instance and that's why we were\nseeing some spike in the graph so this\nis a quick demo of using your compute\nengine service provided by Google Cloud\nwherein you can create create VM\ninstances and use those VM instances for\nyour application installation for any\nother purpose now that we have seen how\nyou use your Cloud console to create an\ninstance and also clean it up let's also\nunderstand how you can do using your\ncommand line options and let's see what\nit takes or what are the different\ncommands which you can use to create\nyour instances now you can always always\nwhen when you're creating an instance\nyou can use compute engine which\nProvisions resources to start the\ninstance so instance basically has\ndifferent states which we can see when\nwe are creating the instance so you\nbasically start the instance instance\nmoves into staging that is prepared for\nyour first boot finally it boots up and\nthen it moves into running so when you\nlook at instance states which we will\ncreate instance and C it will basically\nhave different states such as\nprovisioning where resources are being\nallocated for instance but instance is\nnot yet running then it goes into\nstaging where resources have been\nacquired an instance is being prepared\nfor your first boot then instance is\nbooting up and running and if you are\nstopping an instance it goes into being\nstop status and it would be moved to the\nterminated option you can also do a\nrepairing of instance and finally you\ncan terminate your instance or clean it\nup by stopping and then deleting it now\nwhen you say stopping and resetting an\ninstance you can stop the instance as I\nshowed earlier if you no longer need it\nbut if you need for future use you can\njust use the reset option which will\nbasically wipe the contents of instance\nor any application State and then\nfinally you can stop it and have it\nterminated now when you would want to do\nthat using your Cloud console uh we have\nseen the options now let's also see from\nthe command line tool how you can do it\nso here I have the cloud shell which I\nbrought up from here and I basically\nopened it in a new window so command\nline tool enables you to easily manage\nyour compute engine resources in a\nfriendlier format than using your\ncompute engine API now gcloud which is\npart of cloud SDK is the main command\nhere and then you can always\nautocomplete the different options here\nso when you would want to create or work\non gcloud you can just type in gcloud\nhere and then for example I could just\nsay help to see different options of\ng-cloud which will show me different\noptions which you can use here now we\nwould be interested in compute instances\nso I could also do a gcloud\ncompute compute instances and then I can\nbasically say create and then I can do a\nhelp now that should show me different\noptions which work with gcloud compute\ninstances create command which is\nexpecting an instance name so your\nGoogle Cloud SDK which we can set up on\nour Windows machine or even on your\nLinux machine is set of tools that helps\nyou to manage resources and applications\nhosted on your gcp that is your Google\nCloud platform now here you have options\nsuch as gcloud which I'm showing you\nright now you have Gs util and then you\nhave BQ so that also can be used so you\ncan set up a Google Cloud compute if\nusing g-cloud now what we can do is if\nwe are setting up our SDK on our Windows\nmachine then we would have to do a\ng-cloud in it\nwhich basically initializes your\nconfigurations for\ngcloud now here we are using a cloud\nshell which was started from the console\nand we don't have to basically give your\ngcloud init command because it's already\ninitialized now you can always look at\nyour default Zone you can look at your\nregion what is being used all those\nthings are coming from the metadata\nwhich is being used so for example I\ncould be looking at the metadata for my\nparticular project by just doing a\ngcloud and then I can say\ncompute and I would be interested in\nProject info so I can just do a project\nminus info and then I can do a describe\nand then I need my project ID so I can\nsay minus minus project and I can get my\nproject ID ID from here so you can click\non this one and that's my project ID so\nI can click on this one and here I can\njust do a right click and if it does not\npaste then you can do a control V and\nthen I can try to look at my project\ninfo so this basically will give me the\nmetadata which is by default set and we\ncan always look at what are the regions\nor what is the Zone which has been set\nso if it has been set so I'm looking at\nmy details it is showing me my SSH keys\nand then it can be using your default\nregion and your default available zones\nit also shows my username and other\ndetails so this is basically to look at\nthe metadata which is available now at\nany point of time I can basically say\nadd metadata I can basically choose\nmetadata option and I can say my default\nregion should be Europe which I was\nchoosing earlier so I can just bring up\nthis command again and what I can do is\nI can say here where I have g-cloud\ncompute project info where I did a\ndescribe earlier now what I can also do\nis I can just say add\nmetadata and then I can specify what is\nthe metadata I would be interested in\nadding I can then say Google\ncompute\ndefault region\nand then I can basically give a region\nfor example Europe and then I can say\nWest\n3 and if you are not well experienced\nyou can always do it from console or you\ncan be doing it from here so I'm giving\nGoogle Cloud compute Google compute\ndefault region then I can also give a\nGoogle compute default\nZone and then I can pass in a value for\ndefault zone so I can say Europe where\nthree and then basically I can give an\navailability zone so if it is basically\ngiving me some error where I'm trying to\npass in these values so I can just give\nit this way and then it basically says\nthat if you can look into particular\nhelp to see what is the command which\nyou would have to do now I can basically\ndo a\ngcloud in it here initial configuration\nand this basically says that it is\ninitializing my default configuration it\nsays reinitialize this configuration\nfrom cloud shell you want to create a\nnew configuration so if I had updated my\nmetadata then basically I could just do\na cloud in it and I could be\nreinitializing my default configuration\nor properties which I have passed in so\nas of now I will not activate or change\nis the default region let's go for a\nsimple way in which you can create your\ncompute engine so for example I'll just\nsay one and it is reinitializing it asks\nme what is the username and let's select\nthat it says what is the project and\nlet's select that and do you want to\nconfigure a default compute region and\nzone right and I will just say Yes And\nbasically then it shows me different\noptions which we have here so there are\ntoo many options here and then here we\nwere interested in Europe West 3 so\nlet's choose 21 right and then that\nbasically allows me to choose my region\nand my zone so it also gives you some\nspecifications so it says your project\ndefault compute Zone has been set to\nEurope West 3A you can change it by\nrunning g-cloud config set and you can\ngive a compute zone right so I can\nalways give these commands I can get\nhelp information here so I can just say\ngcloud config set and I can be\nspecifying the compute zone so I can say\ncompute SL Zone and I can give a Zone I\ncan say compute SL region and I can give\na region name if I would want to do it\nor the easier way is like what I did\nright now so you can basically do a\ncommand gcloud in it and then basically\nit allows you to change your\nconfiguration or set default things here\nyou can all the times you can say gcloud\nconfig unset to basically remove a\ncompute zone or a compute region now\nthere are different ways so if you were\nworking on a Linux machine you could\nalways use an export command something\nlike this so you could do export compute\nsorry Cloud\nSDK and then you you can say compute\nuncore Zone and then give your Zone name\nor compute uncore region and give your\nregion or you could add it in your bash\nRC file right now that is when you have\nyour Cloud SDK set up on your Linux\nmachine or on Windows machine and you\nwould want to specifically set a Zone\nand a region for all your computer\nrelated resources so we don't need to do\nthat the default settings are already\ngiven here right and and what we can do\nis we can start by quickly looking into\ng-cloud compute instances options so I\ncan say g-cloud compute\ninstances and then I can just do a list\nat any point of time if you would need\nhelp you can just do a g-cloud compute\nand then say minus minus help or I could\njust do a g-cloud compute and that shows\nme different options which I have here\nfrom which I use instances I can always\ntype instances and again hit enter and\nit shows me different options what you\nwould want to do so I can initially just\ntype list which should show me what are\nthe list or what are the instances\navailable and as of now we don't have\nany instances I can always do a list and\nthen I can specify minus minus format\nand then try to get the information in a\nJson format or EML or minus minus format\ntext\nso you can always do a list you can do a\nfilter so there are different options\nwith your list and you can you can try\ndoing a help here and that basically\nshows you what are the options so for\nexample if I do a help and it shows me\nwith list what are the things you can do\nso you can give a name you can give a\nregular expression you can say in\nparticular Zone you can use a minus\nfilter so there are different commands\nwhich are available and you can always\nfind all those options here as I showed\nyou earlier so now what we would be\ninterested in is basically going for\nyour compute instances I can always do a\nSSH and I can create an instance I can\nadd and remove metadata right for my\ninstances by giving a particular Zone by\ngiving a particular region and if you\nwould want to do that now here what we\ncan do is is we can basically create an\ninstance by just giving a name to that\nparticular instance and we can then go\nback to our console and see what has it\ndone so I can say here create so that's\nan option let's see what does the create\ndo so it says okay you are giving a\ncreate option but you would have to give\na name so let's say let's call it E1 and\nthat will be the name of my instance and\nthis one is an easy command from your\nCloud shell which basically creates an\ninstance you see the Zone which has been\nset it is the standard machine type it\nis not preemptable it has an internal IP\nand it has an external IP now I have\ncreated an instance and here I can just\ngo back and then I can just do a Refresh\non this page and that already shows me\nthe instance which I have created and\nthen you can use the same method to\nconnect to it using an SSH so I have an\ninstance created from my cloud shell and\nwhat I can do is I can basically look\ninto instances and see what are the\ndifferent options with instance so if we\ndid a create right you have an option\ndelete we did a create you have an\noption delete you can be then deleting\nthe instance from the command line or\nyou can use other options so you can do\na list you can do a stop you can start\nso I can basically do a stop and let's\nsay even let's go ahead and do a stop\ncommands are pretty easy here to\nremember or you can always use the help\noption and now I'm trying to stop the\ninstance and then basically I can go\nahead and delete it so this is a simple\nway where I created a instance from the\ncommand line or from the console which I\nshowed earlier and similarly you can be\nworking with other options so now I've\ncreated stop the instance let's do a\nlisting to see if my instance shows up\nit shows up right and it says the status\nis terminated so you have stopped it\nit's in the terminated status and now\nwhat I can do is I can go ahead and\ndelete\nit so it says this will be lost are you\nsure you would want to continue just say\nyes and that should take care of\ndeleting your instance so this is a\nquick demo on creating your instance we\nhave already seen how you can connect to\nthese instances using SSH now that we\nhave created instances let's also see\nhow to use Google Cloud's storage\nservice which can be used to load data\nor upload data so for this we will have\nto look into your Google cloud storage\noptions and here you can look in cloud\nstorage so let's go back here on the top\nwhich shows me different Services which\nwe have here and let's look into storage\nso this one shows me your storage option\nnow you can click on browser and that\nbasically shows me your storage browser\nwhich shows me on the top you have\noptions for creating a bucket now Google\nCloud Storage allows you to store any\nkind of data here the easiest and the\nsimplest way would be by using Cloud\nconsole although you can again use cloud\nshell and in that you can use your GS\nutil command and GS util basically has\ndifferent options where you can be using\nsay for example I would want to work on\nbuckets so I can be using MB and then I\ncan use my command line option to create\nbuckets I can put in data there I can\nbrowse it and I can access the data from\ncommand line so let's create create a\nbucket here let's click on this let's\ngive it a name so let's say my data\nimportant that's the name now I can\nclick on continue straight away I can\nlook into all of these options if I'm\ninterested in so you can basically be\nlooking at your monthly cost estimate in\nthe beginning now I can click on\ncontinue or you can say choose where to\nstore your data and this one shows you\ndifferent options so you have region\nspecific\nso let's also give the bucket name with\nall lowercase that's what is required\nyeah so coming back to the location type\nyou can choose multi- region which\nbasically allows High availability so\nyour bucket or your storage option will\nbe accessible across regions you can\nalso give dual region and high\navailability and low latency across two\nregions I can also say region specific\nso for our use case we can just give\nregion specific which can keep our cost\nlow but in business use cases you would\nbe going for multi- region now here you\nhave location and I would again go for\nsay Europe and let's choose Europe west3\nFrankfurt it is always a good practice\nthat when you create your instances when\nyou create your storage or you use\ndifferent Services try to have a\ngeographical region Chosen and then you\nwould try to put things or your services\nwithin the particular region within a\nparticular Zone unless you would want to\nmake it accessible and available across\nregions now I can then choose a default\nstorage class so when you say default\nstorage class there are different\nstorage class and each one is for a\ndifferent use case so you have standard\nwhich is best for short-term storage and\nfrequently accessed data you have\nnearline so this is basically best for\nbackups and data access less than once a\nmonth you can also have cold line l so\nthese are basically like your cold\nstorage or freezing storage which you\nmight have heard generically as terms so\nyou can choose one of these storage\nclasses depending on what will be the\nuse case for this particular storage\nbucket so let it be standard now how to\ncontrol access to objects so you can\nbasically say specify access to\nindividual objects by using object level\npermissions now you can give permissions\nto the bucket you can just say uniform\naccess to all objects in the bucket by\nusing only Bucket Level permissions so\nyou can choose that you can also go into\nAdvan settings and here you can see\ndifferent ways in which you can have\nconfiguration set up now you can also\nhave a retention policy to specify the\nminimum duration where that this buckets\nobject must be protected from deletion\nand you can set a retention policy we\nwill not get into all that we will just\nfirst try creating a bucket so just\nclick on Create and that should create\nyour bucket wherein I have my bucket now\nI can click on overview to see the\ndetails what is the region which region\nit belongs what is the storage class\nanytime you can always click on edit\nbucket and make some changes here you\ncan look at the permissions so bucket\nuses F Grand access allowing you to\nspecify access to individual objects and\nthen you can basically look at who has\naccess to this so in my case editors of\nthe project they basically are the\nbucket owners owners of project viewers\nof the project right and you can\nbasically choose what kind of access you\nneed so for this you can always go into\ncloud storage and then you can decide\nwhat kind of access you would want to\ngive whether that's a storage admin it's\nan object admin object Creator object\nviewer and so on you can always look at\nstorage Legacy\nand for any other services depending on\nwhat apis you have enabled right you can\nalways control your permissions so right\nnow it is storage Legacy bucket reader\nand that's fine and this one is bucket\nowner and then might be I was using some\nother services like data proc which uses\ncloud storage and that's why I've given\ndata proc service agent also so these\nare some of the members you can remove\nyou can view by specific members you can\nview by roles so what are the different\nroles which have access to this so it\nsays storage Legacy bucket owner there\nare two owners based on this particular\nproject so these are autocont controlled\nbut then you can add or remove machines\nyou can save storage cost by adding a\nlife cycle rule to delete objects after\nthe duration of current retention policy\nso you can add different policies and\nyou can basically control your bucket\nnow my bucket is already created\nright so I can go back and then I see my\nbucket is already here I can click on\nthis option and you can anytime edit the\nbucket permissions you can edit the\nlabels the default storage class you can\njust go ahead and delete the bucket you\ncan export it to Cloud pup sub so\nbasically if you would want to have the\ncontent from this bucket being\naccessible in a message queuing system\nyou can go for Pub sub you can process\nwith Cloud functions and you can scan\nwith cloud data loss prevention so there\nare different options which are\navailable we can always select this\nbucket and delete it now I can click on\nthe bucket and that basically shows me\ndifferent ways in which I can upload\nsome data here so I can just click on\nupload files and here then I can choose\nsome files so for example I'll go in\nhere I'll go into data sets and I have\ndifferent data sets so for example let's\nchoose this one which is a CSV file and\nthen I'm just uploading this to my cloud\nstorage right it's as simple as this so\nyou can drag and drop your files or you\ncan just upload your files and my file\nis uploaded here now I can basically\nedit permissions for this one right so\nthis is in the bucket so anyone who has\naccess to this bucket can basically\ndownload this file it can they can copy\nmove or rename this you can export it\nand you can look at the permissions of\nthis file so let's look at edit\npermissions and it says\nfor this project whoever is the owner it\nhas access I've also given a specific\nuser my Gmail ID and I've given access\nso at any point of time you can just say\nadd item and then you can start giving\ndifferent kind of accesses so let's\nclick on cancel here now my data is\nalready uploaded into this particular\nbucket and that's a simple usage of your\ncloud storage now what we can also do is\nI can basically select this and I can\ndelete it I can also create specific\nfolders and then basically uh load data\ninto it I can click on this one I can\njust do a download and then I can\ndownload it anywhere on my machine so\nlet's go to desktop and let's download\nthis file so we not only uploaded some\ncontent in the bucket but we also\ndownloaded that in a different location\nwhich will be accessible now what I\ncould have also done is I could have\ncreated a folder here and I could have\nspecified say for example immediate\nimmediate\ndata okay and I'm clicking on this one\nso that's my immediate data I can click\non this one and now I can upload my data\nspecifically to this particular folder\nby using the same mechanism you can just\ndo upload file let's choose air\npassengers let's do a open and and my\nfile will be\nuploaded so you can always choose what\nis the retention expiry date for this\none so as of now there is nothing right\nbut you can be deleted objects can be\ndeleted or modified until they reach\ntheir minimum duration you can control\nall of that you can basically download\nit right you can copy it and you can\nmove it and rename it so this is a\nsimple example where I created a\nparticular bucket right now if for\nexample you click on this transfer so it\nsays cloud storage data transfer\nproducts have moved you can now find\nstorage transfer service on premise data\nand transfer Appliance in new data\ntransfer section right so you can always\ngo back to cloud storage you can also\nlook at transfer options which are\nmainly when you are using a on premise\nservice and you would want to upload\ndata in a Google Cloud right so this is\nmy bucket here now I can go to Cloud\nconsole\nand here what I can do is if I would be\ninterested in working so I can just say\nGS util right and then we have uh for\nexample let's try a help okay and that\nbasically shows me my gsutil now you can\nalways go to Quick Start GS util tool\nand this is one more way wherein\nbasically you can do it from the command\nline so working with buckets so you can\ndo a GS util MB minus B and then then on\na particular Zone if you would be\ninterested in and then you can say GS\ncolon and give a name so my awesome\nbucket this is how you will create a\nbucket which will show you it is\ncreating a bucket and then basically you\ncan upload an image or some data from\ninternet you can just do a wget download\nthe file and then you can just do a GS\nutil copy command and that basically\nwill pick up the file from your Cloud\nshell location put it in your bucket\nonce you have done that you can always\ndo a copy right so here you're doing a\ncopy from your local machine that is\nyour Cloud shell machine to your bucket\nand you can do the reverse of that that\nis you can do a copy and you can point\nyour bucket and the file and download it\nto your desktops so you can just\ndownload that using the command line and\nyou can copy the object to a folder in\nthe bucket so that is by creating a\nparticular folder and you're pushing the\nfile into a particular bucket you can\nlist the contents of a bucket using LS\nand then give your bucket name so GS\ncolon so we can just try this one to be\nsimple and rest you guys can try so here\nyou can just do a GS util you can do a\nLS GS colon SL slash and then I need to\ngive my bucket name so in my case the\nbucket name was my data important so\nlet's try that so let's say my data\nimportant and I'm trying to list the\nbucket and the content it has right and\nthen you have a folder and then you can\nlook into the folder and look into the\nfiles so this is a simple quick option\nwherein you can use your Cloud shell you\ncould be using your Google Cloud SDK\nfrom your local machine or you can be\nusing Cloud console to create a bucket\nupload some data on it download the data\nsee if the data is accessible and that\nbasically shows you the power of cloud\nstorage where you can easily upload any\nkind of data now what we can also do is\nas you're using a free account or even a\npaid account unless and until you would\nwant to keep the bucket you can select\nit and you can just go ahead and delete\nit so this will basically ask you to ke\nthe bucket name and let's say my data\nimportant you need to confirm your\nbucket name click on confirm and you\ncould have done that using gsutil and a\ndelete command from the command line\nthat is from cloud shell so we have now\ncreated a bucket we have uploaded some\ndata into it we saw how you can download\nit or create a folder and upload some\nspecific data into it and also you can\ndo the same thing using GS util tools\nwherein you can list your bucket create\nyour buckets delete it create some\nfolders into it and do everything from\nthe command online so this is in simple\nway you can use your gcp where either\nyou can spin up your machines or you can\nuse cloud storage to basically use a\nstorage or a easy to use instance on\nGoogle Cloud platform welcome to this\ntutorial about Google Cloud platform and\nhere we will learn about cloud computing\nwhat is cloud computing what is\ngcp that is your Google Cloud platform\nwhat are the benefits of Google Cloud\nplatform and what are its different\nServices a little bit about Google's\ninfrastructure a comparison of different\nCloud providers such as Google offering\ngcp that is Google's Cloud platform\nAmazon offering Amazon web services and\nMicrosoft which offers Azure we will\nalso learn about Domino's Piza use case\nand then have a quick demo on using some\nof the services on\ngcp before we begin let's understand why\ncloud computing and it would be always\ngood to learn about cloud computing\nbased on a use case there are varied use\ncases where organizations are adopting\nor moving their Solutions or their\ninfrastructure into cloud or I can\nsimply say integrating with Cloud now\nhere is one use case Nina started a\ncompany that relates to website\ndevelopment the challenges which Nina\nwas facing were low memory space\nwhenever required for processing or for\nany other kind of application related\nwork high traffic to website that\ncrashed it and also less number of\nservers now with these challenges she\nwas then referred to concept of cloud\ncomputing\nand how that could benefit and help her\nin solving her issues most of her issues\nwere solved when she started using cloud\ncomputing and with cloud computing she\ncould increase her memory space as\nrequired that is on demand control the\nload to the website that is basically\nload balancing and handling more\nrequests on the website or request per\nminute buying servers at a lower price\nthat is is scaling up or down based on\nthe\nrequirement when we talk about cloud\ncomputing cloud computing is use of\nhardware and software components which a\ncloud provider offers as a service which\ncan be accessed over Network cloud\ncomputing is use of these resources\nwhich could be either dedicated\nresources or coming from a pool of\nresources which cloud provider offers to\ndeliver a service to clients users can\naccess these different Services\napplications files from any device which\ncan basically access\nInternet cloud computing allows\nautomatic software\nintegration it allows backing up and\nrestoring of\ndata it basically offers unlimited\nstorage memory or computation\ncapacity it gives access to reliable\nsources which usually the cloud provider\nthemselves are using for their use case\nand it is a cost efficient model which\nhelps organizations to quickly integrate\nor basically modernize their\ninfrastructure cloud computing is\nusually used with it or within it space\nwherein there are five traits if there\nis a requirement of\nresources as the business dynamically\nchanges or grows so for this cloud\ncomputing offers on demand\nself-service so users could be using on\ndemand Computing\nresources or memory resources storage\nNetwork and so on provided by cloud\nprovider and also do a self-service\nall this is possible using a simple\ninterface and users can be using\nprocessing power storage Network as they\nneed and pay as they go so there is\nleast or no human intervention required\nwhen it comes to projects which might\nneed scalable network access cloud\ncomputing offers broad network access\nthat is accessing resources over Network\nacross geographical regions or what we\ncall as availability zones which might\nbe multiple sites within a particular\ngeographical region Cloud providers also\nhave what we call as resource pooling so\nthis basically provides a huge pool of\nresources which are shared and can be\naccessed by customers at a lower cost\nnow there might be customers which are\ninterested in not sharing the resources\nand would be interested in dedicated\nresources and in this case cloud\nprovider also have so tenant offerings\nwhich help such customers if an IT\nbusiness or any other business needs\nrapid\nelasticity then Cloud providers also\nhave resources which are offered which\nare elastic you can get more resources\nrapidly as needed and thus you can scale\nup and down think of a gaming company\nwhich would be interested in launching a\nnew game and they would have predicted a\ncertain number of users which would get\nonto the portal playing the game and\nwhat happens if the request per minute\nor if the number of users who are\njoining in might increase now in this\ncase organization would want an\nunderlying solution which handles this\ndynamism scales as needed on demand and\nonce the demand is done scales down this\nis possible using a cloud computing\nsolution cloud Computing Solutions also\ninclude measured services that is pay as\nyou go model for the usage or for the\nreservations which a user or\norganization would have made for\nresources offered by cloud computing so\nwhen we talk about cloud computing one\nof the question which always arises is\nwhy is this model so compelling why is\nthis so interesting for organizations or\nusers who would want to use one or many\nservices from cloud computing so first\nwave of trend which brought storage\ncloud computing was what we call as Colo\nthat is collocation it shops that have\nbeen using or managing huge amount of\ndata from decades basically wanted to\nbuild their infrastructures to handle\ntheir business needs now instead of\nbuilding costlier data centers they\nwould rent space or share facilities and\nthis was being done by organizations\neven in past thus they would free up the\ncapital for other use cases now this was\nmore of user configured managed and\nmaintained by them later organizations\nstarted thinking of virtualization so\nthat was again user configured but\nprovider managed and maintained so\ncomponents of a virtualized data center\nmatched that of a physical Data Center\nand organizations would have virtual\ndevices separately managed from\nunderlying devices then later came\ncontainer based architectures or\nbasically automated services so within\nGoogle services are automatically\nprovisioned and configured letting your\ninfrastructure scale on demand there are\nvarious reasons why an organization\nwould think of integrating with cloud or\nbenefiting by using cloud and thus\ninstantaneously reaping the benefits of\nmodernizing their\ninfrastructure now few famous Cloud\nproviders are here so you have Amazon\nwhich offers Amazon web services and a\nhuge list of services which come in with\nthis you have Microsoft's aure you have\nOracle Cloud you have Sap's Cloud\nSolutions G PCP which is offered by\nGoogle Salesforce and so on there are\nmany other small players which are also\nproviding different Services which are\ncloud-based or organizations which are\npartnering with these main Cloud\nproviders thus offering cloud services\nto their\ncustomers when we talk about why Google\nCloud platform there are various reasons\nwhy someone would choose Google Cloud\nplatform gcp has better pricing compared\nto its\ncompetitors when it comes to Speed and\nPerformance it is very fast and\nincreases the performance of the\nproject live migration of apps and there\nare huge number of solutions which I\nwill show you further in further screens\nwhich help an organization to adapt to a\ncloud platform or integrated with Cloud\nplatform or even completely migrate into\na cloud platform none of Google's\ncompetitors provide live migration of\napps when we talk about Big Data AI\nmachine learning kind of solutions gcp\nprovides lot of innovative solutions in\ncomparison to other Cloud providers such\nas AWS Azure and so\non so what is Google Cloud platform it\nis a set of Cloud Computing Services\nprovided by Google that runs on the same\ninfrastructure that Google uses\nto and for its end user products like\nYouTube Gmail and so\non let's learn about benefits of Google\nCloud\nplatform such as high productivity\nworking from anywhere quick\ncollaboration high security fewer data\nstored on vulnerable devices reliable\nresources which can be used across\norganization across geographical regions\nacross countries\nvery flexible which allows organizations\nto scale up and down as the demand Rises\nor as the demand declines and cost\neffective solutions for various use\ncases these are some of the benefits and\nif we look into different Services which\nGoogle Cloud platform offers we could\nlook into detailed benefits which each\nservice offers in a different use case\nwhich basically helps organiz iations\nworking in different domains handling\ndifferent kind of small mid or larger\nbusinesses and with different business\ngoals when we talk about Google Cloud\nplatform Services here is a list of\nservices or I could say high level\ndomains or categories of services so you\nhave compute related Services you have\nstorage and database you have networking\nBig Data developer tools identity and\nSecurity Management Internet of Things\nCloud AI management tools and also data\ntransfer\nSolutions when we talk about Google's\ninfrastructure Google has one of the\nmost powerful infrastructure in the\nworld the infrastructure is available in\ntwo levels the physical and the abstract\nlayers you have physical infrastructure\nand then you have the abstract\ninfrastructure physical infrastructure\nconsists of data centers extensive\ndevelopment of high efficiency backend\ndata\ncenters you have a very strong backbone\nNetwork which is used by Google itself\nand also offered as services to\ncustomers via gcp platform services so\nyou have Global mesed redundant backbone\nNetwork points of presence when we talk\nabout Google it has 110 plus Edge points\nof presence in more than 200 countries\nand when we talk about Edge caching Edge\ncaching platform at periphery of their\nNetwork so this is what defines the\nphysical infrastructure of Google now\nthere is much more to it rather than\njust these four points when we talk\nabout abstract infrastructure that is\ndivided in global regions and zones when\nwe talk about Zone a zone is roughly\nequivalent to a Data Center and a single\npoint of failure so you could have your\ncompute engine which is within a zone or\nyou could say computer engine is a zonal\nresource you have regions which are\ngeographical areas which contain\nmultiple zones so you could have a\nregion for us Central or Europe Central\nEurope West and so on and within a\nregion you would have one or multiple\nzones\nand zones basically would allow High\navailability of\nresources so you have Cloud load\nbalancer is an example which is regional\nresource then you have global resources\nand they are available and shared across\nthe planet so you have various global\nresources such as Network which could be\neven your IP addresses and so\non now let's do a quick comparison of\nAWS W aure ws gcp and let's look at what\neach cloud provider offers later we will\nalso look into different services in\ndetail when it comes to Google Cloud\nplatform what each service does what you\ncan benefit from which service should\nyou use in what case we will learn about\nthose in later slides if I compare your\ndifferent Cloud providers when we talk\nabout Amazon and its Cloud offerings\nthat is Amazon web services or AWS as we\nwell know it Amazon web services has 69\navailability zones within 22\ngeographical locations and soon it will\nhave 12 more in future so this number\nkeeps growing based on the spread of the\nservices which a particular cloud\nprovider offers here we are talking\nabout availability Zone specific\ninformation when we talk about\nMicrosoft's azure it has 54 regions\nworldwide and is available in 140\ncountries across the globe when we talk\nabout Google Cloud Google Cloud platform\nis available in 200 plus countries\nacross the\nglobe when we talk about virtual servers\nAmazon's ec2 that is elastic compute\nCloud it is a web service which\nbasically helps to resize your compute\ncapacity where you can run your\napplication programs on a virtual\nmachine so using ec2 service you could\nlaunch virtual instances that could have\nany distribution of Linux Windows you\ncould have different specifications when\nit comes to Ram or CPU cores or disk you\ncould also decide on what kind of\nstorage a particular instance should use\nwhether the storage should be local to\nthe instance or whe whether that should\nbe a elastic file system or even an\nobject storage\nwhen it comes to Azure or Microsoft's\noffering Azure virtual machine that is\ninfrastructure as a service gives a user\nthe ability to deploy and manage a\nvirtual environment inside a virtual\nNetwork on the cloud and this virtual\nNetwork on the cloud would be managed by\ncloud provider Google cloud or the\nofferings from Google Cloud platform\nthat is gcp VM instances enables users\nto build deploy and manage virtual\nmachines in order to run different kind\nof workloads on the cloud now when we\ntalk about compute engine here it would\nbe good to discuss a little bit more\nabout compute engine and what are the\ndifferent options which Google Cloud\noffers so when you talk about your\ncompute engine you have scalable high\nperformance virtual machines computer\nengine delivers configur\nvirtual machines which run in Google's\ndata center with access to high\nperformance networking infrastructure\nand block storage and you could select\nVMS for your needs that could be general\npurpose or workload optimized and when\nwe talk about workload optimized you\nhave predefined machines or you have\ncustom machine sizes you can integrate\ncompute with other Google cloud services\nsuch as AI or ML and go for your data\nanalytics you have when we talk about\nyour gcp VM instances just to expand on\nthat you have general purpose instances\nwhich we call as\nN2 which provide a balance between price\nand performance and they are well suited\nfor most workloads including line of\nbusiness applications web servers and\ndatabases Google Cloud also offers\ncompute optimized instances which we\ncall as C2 instances which offers\nconsistent high-end virtual CPU\nperformance which are good for AAA\ngaming Eda HBC and other applications\nnow when we talk about compute optimize\nyour general purpose how would we leave\nmemory optimized instances those are M2\nmachines which Google offers so these\noffer highest amount of memory these VMS\nare well suited for inmemory databases\nsuch as sap Hana real time analytics and\ninmemory caches so if I would summarize\nthis when we talk about different\ninstances\nAWS also offers different kind of\ninstances which are memory or compute or\ndis optimized you have general purpose\nand each category of machines has a\ndifferent pricing model you can always\ngo to an AWS website look for the\npricing models and that will give you an\nidea of on demand in instances or\ndedicated instances reserved instances\nand so on similarly if you talk about\nGoogle Cloud Google Cloud also has\ninstances with various options which\nbecome the key features of why customers\nwould choose Google Cloud platform such\nas live migration for VMS so computer\nengine within your gcp can live migrate\nbetween host systems and when I say live\nmigrate it basically means without\nrebooting which keeps your application\nrunning even when the underlying host\nsystems require maintenance you also\nhave preemptable virtual machines\nwherein you can run bad jobs and fault\ntolerant workloads on preemptable VMS to\nreduce your virtual CPU and memory cost\nby up to 80% while getting the same\nperformance so these are your preemptive\nor preemptible virtual machines the only\ndemmin is these can give you a really\ncost efficient resource usage however\ncan be taken off the shelf anytime and\nthat's why we call them preemptible\nvirtual machines you also have soul\ntenant noes which are physical compute\nengine servers dedicated explicitly or\nexclusively for users use case and when\nwe talk about Soul tenant nodes these\nare usually good when you are dealing\nwith or when you're working with your\napplication s which we call as bring\nyour own license applications so Soul\ntenant nodes give you access to same\nmachine types and virtual machine config\noptions as regular compute instances so\nthere are different options which Google\nCloud offers when it comes to these\ninstances which we are talking about and\nit takes care of different use cases in\ncomparison to other Cloud providers\nwhich are also offering these services\nsuch as you can have predefined machine\ntypes you can have custom machine types\npreemptable VMS as I said live migration\nof VMS you can use persistent diss which\ncould give you durable high performance\nblock storage you have local ssds you\nalso have GPU accelerators which can be\nadded to accelerate computational\nintensive workloads such as machine\nlearning simulation medical analysis and\nso on and you have features such as\nGlobal load balancing which makes Google\nCloud a unique\nChoice when we talk about platform as a\nservice Amazon has platform as a service\noffering which we call as elastic bean\nstock among one of its services it's an\norchestration service for deploying\napplications and helping in maintaining\nthese applications as your cloud service\nprovides a platform to write the user\napplication code without without\nworrying about the hardware resources\nGoogle app engine is a service used by\nDevelopers for building and hosting\napplications on Google's data centers\nwhen we talk about serverless Computing\nso Amazon's AWS Lambda is a serverless\ncompute service it is used to execute\nbackend code and scales automatically\nwhen required when we talk about aure\nyou have something called as functions\nwhich allow users\nto build applications using serverless\nsimple functions with a programming\nlanguage of their choice when we talk\nabout Google cloud gcp has Cloud\nfunctions which is easiest way to run\nyour code in the cloud and it is highly\navailable and Fa tolerant so in these\ndays when we are talking about\nmicroservices architecture which\norganizations are preferring when we are\ntalking about organizations which can\nscale which can dynamically\nchange their underlying architecture\norganizations would be interested in\nserverless Computing where they do not\nhave to have a infrastructure set up a\nplanned in advance before going for\ntheir use case and this is where\nmonolithic applications are really not a\nPreferred Choice lot of organizations\nare decomposing their applications into\nmicroservices based on business\ncapability or decomposing based on\nsubdomains we can learn about\nmicroservices architecture later but\njust to know that serverless Computing\nwhich basically helps any organization\nif for example if you have a web\napplication that receives nonlinear\ntraffic and you cannot keep an eye on\nyour server always it would be good to\nhave someone to autoscale your\napplication serverless is basically a\nComputing model where cloud service\nprovider is responsible for managing the\npiece of code without the developer\nhaving to bother about infrastructure\nsetup management maintenance and so on\nnow when we talk about applications\nbeing serverless or benefiting from\nserverless Computing one of the key\nthings would be zero Administration so\ndeploying application without any\nprovisioning and management autoscaling\ncapability that is let the service\nprovider worry about scaling the\napplication up and down you have paper\nuse model which any customer would want\nto benefit from that is pay only for the\nresources that you have used or that you\nare continuing to use right shorten the\ntime between idea implementation and\nemployment and this is something which\nany organization would want that you\nwould want a faster bring to the market\nsolution timeline in comparison to\ngetting entangled with deployment\nmanagement and maintenance of your\nunderlying infrastructure when your\napplications are facing a high demand so\nwhen we talk about serverless it is a\nfunction as a service because each part\nof your application is divided as\nfunctions and can be hosted over\nmultiple service providers you have\nserverless apps which are usually\ndivided as separate units or functions\nbased on functionalities or domains and\nso on so serverless Computing is ging\nquite popularity these days in\ncomparison to the traditional three tier\narchitecture where you had a\npresentation layer you had an\napplication layer you have a database\nlayer now that kind of infrastructure is\nnot really preferred in today's modern\ntimes when organizations are working on\ndifferent kind of newer applications\nwhen we talk about object storage Amazon\nhas simple storage service that is S3 it\nprovides object storage which is built\nfor storing and recovering information\nor data from anywhere over the Internet\naure comes up with blob storage that is\nbinary large objects storage offers\nlarge amount of storage and scalability\nit stores the object in the T and\ndepending on how often the data is being\naccessed now same thing applies to a S3\nwhich is from Amazon so S3 also has\ndifferent kind of storage classes which\ncan be selected when a user or\norganization intends to use a storage\nservice and when I speak about storage\nclasses it basically means having a\nfrequent access storage or a infrequent\naccess storage or what we call as just\nan archival\nsolution Google cloud has cloud storage\nand provides unified object storage for\nlive or archive data this service is\nused to store and access data on gcp\ninfrastructure when it comes to\nadvantages Amazon web services has\nEnterprise friendly Services easy access\nto resources increase in Speed and\nAgility and that to on demand and takes\ncare of your security and reliability of\nresources which are offered when it\ncomes to aure it has better development\noperations strong security profile\nprovides lot of costeffective solutions\nand operation execution friendly when we\ntalk about Google Cloud one of the key\nfeatures here is better pricing than\ncompetitors live migration of virtual\nmachines which really interests lot of\norganizations would want to modernize\ntheir infrastructure without having any\nkind of disruption in their existing\nServices improved performance redundant\nbackups and so on when it comes to\ndisadvantages in AWS you have\nlimitations when it comes to ec2 service\nwell there are different options in the\nkind of machines which you can choose\nwhich you can work on you have a\ntechnical support fee which is incurred\nnetwork connectivity and then also\ndowntime which might be in case when\nyou're migrating as your it has\ndifferent code base for cloud and\npremise platform as a service ecosystem\nis not really as efficient as\ninfrastructure as a service poor\nmanagement of GUI and tools integrated\nbackup when we talk about Google Cloud\nsupport fee is quite Hefty it depends on\nwhat kind of solution or support you\nwould or organization would be\ninterested in it has a complex pricing\nschema although it has different use\ncases for which any user or any\norganization can benefit from\ndownloading data from Google cloud\nservices is an expensive option storage\nmight not be however uploading data or\ndownloading data would be an expensive\noption when we talk about Domino's Piza\nuse case now while we were discussing\nabout these features I would really want\nto spend more time in discussing each of\nthese features or services in detail\nsuch as you have compute engine you have\nstorage you have big table you have data\nproc and so on so there are huge list of\nservices now before we get into your\nDomino's Piza use case let me show you\nthis page on Google Cloud where you can\nlook at different services so if you go\nto cloud.google.com and if you look at\nget started option under doc so here you\ncan find build Solutions look at\ndifferent use cases learn from basics of\nwhat is your Google Cloud what are Cloud\nBasics then you can look at different\nCloud products so here you have products\nin different categories such as Ai and\nmachine learning API management compute\ncontainers data analytics databases\ndeveloper tools and so on and you can\nalways click on any one of these to look\ninto different solutions which are being\noffered what are the different use cases\nwhat are the best practices when it\ncomes to migrating VMS to compute engine\nor operating containers or building\ncontainers and so on you can always look\nat featured products and that gives you\na quick snapshot of what are the\ndifferent products such as you have\ncompute engine you have Cloud run big\nquery which is a data warehouse you have\ncloudsql which is a managed MySQL or\npostgress you have cloud storage to\nbasically Bally pushing any kind of data\nthere you have security key enforcement\nAi and machine learning and so on so you\nhave different feature products now if\nyou scroll down to the lower end of this\npage you can again look at different\nsolutions and that would be really\ninteresting to read and learn from so\nyou have infrastructure modernization\nyou have application modernization you\nhave data management and so on so if I\nlook at INF structure\nmodernization you could basically look\nat the solutions which Google Cloud\noffers and what it does when it comes to\nhaving your infrastructure modernized or\nbenefiting by integrating with cloud and\nhaving immediate benefits of\ninfrastructure modernization you can\nlook at different use cases what they\nare doing how Google Cloud really helps\nwhen it comes to migrating the workloads\nto cloud and how your different Cloud\nSolutions such as VM migration you have\nsap on Google Cloud vmw as a service and\nso on and you could learn from these\ndifferent solutions which are offered\nyou can also look at application\nmodernization so not only infrastructure\nmodernization but organizations would\nalso be interested in relooking at their\napplications relooking at how these\napplications could be moved from\nmonolitic to microservices architecture\nor how applications can benefit from\nmodernization and cloud computing\nofferings so you have again different\nuse cases here H which talks about\ndifferent ways in which Google Cloud can\nhelp how you can modernize your\napplications how you can use different\nsolutions which Google cloud is offering\nnow when we talk about Cloud Computing\nServices you can always go into\ncloud.google.com\nif you have created a free account then\nyou can just login and every user by\ndefault gets a $300 free credit so\nwherein they can try out different\nproducts where they can use different\nservices so here if I click on Console\nwhere I'm already logged in with my\nGmail account or my Google Cloud account\nwherein I have $300 free credit out of\nwhich some is being used you have a\nGoogle Cloud console and here from the\nhamburger menu you can click and you can\nlook at different services within\ndifferent domains so you have compute\ndomain which has different services such\nas app you have compute engine and that\nbasically allows you to use your VM\ninstances which we were talking about\nprevious slides different instance\ngroups create your templates use Soul\ntenant notes create snapshots or backup\nof your data use different zones you can\ngo for kubernetes which is containerized\nbased engine you have Cloud functions\nyou have Cloud run and then you have\nstorage related different options such\nas big table you have data store fire\nstore file store storage and so on and\nfor each of these Services you can read\nabout from the Google's documentation or\nanyways I will be explaining that later\nyou can also look at networking related\noperation related and other tools which\nare offered by Google Cloud so these are\nhuge list of services which Google Cloud\nplatform offers in different ways for\ndifferent use cases now let's look at\nthis Domino's Piza use case and see what\nit helps us learn about so you can\nalways access this page by going to this\nlink which talks about customers and\nthen which shows you different use\ncases so Domino's increasing monthly\nRevenue by 6% with Google analytics\npremium Google tag manager and Google\nbig query so this is basically when\nDomino started using gcp and what was\nthe result of that now let's look\nfurther into\nthis so we all know that Domino is most\npopular Piza delivery chain operating\nacross the globe but how was that\npossible let's take a look so the\nchallenges were they wanted to integrate\nmarketing measurement across various\ndevices connecting CRM and Digital Data\nto create a clear view of customer\nBehavior to make cross Channel marketing\nperformance analysis easy and efficient\nnow for these challenges which Domino's\nwas facing the solution was using Google\nanalytics premium Google tag manager and\nbig query which were used to integrate\ndigital data source and CRM data\nreporting was made easier and more\nefficient by implementing Google\nanalytics premium because it had the\nability to access a single Google\nanalytics account to evaluate web and\napp\nperformance by using the new Google tag\nmanager implementation dominas were able\nto act fast they were able to connect\nCRM data with digital analytics which\nbasically provided Domino with with\ngreater visibility on customer Behavior\nwhat was the result there was an\nimmediate 6% increase in monthly Revenue\n80% of costs in ad serving and\noperations were saved increases agility\nwith streamline tag management they\nobtained easy access to powerful\nreporting and customized dashboards now\nthat was just one simple use case before\nwe go on to handson we can also talk a\nlittle bit back about about the services\nwhich Google Cloud offers as we\ndiscussed and some of these Services\nwhich can really make you think why not\nGoogle Cloud platform so when we talk\nabout your different Cloud platform\nServices let's learn about some of these\nservices in brief in what each service\nis what it does and how it can help us\nin handling our use cases or working\nwith different\nproducts so let's learn briefly about\ndifferent Services which Google Cloud\nplatform offers now one of the domains\nis compute and then let's look at the\ncompute Services which gcp offers now\nhere I can log into the console and this\nhamburger menu on the top left corner I\ncan click on this one and go into the\ncompute engine section so this is the\ncompute domain which has app engine\nkubernetes engine Cloud Factory\nfunctions and Cloud run so these are\nyour different Services which are\noffered within the compute domain and\nhere we can get into compute engine by\nclicking on this one and then basically\ngoing to VM instances so before we see\nhow we can use this compute engine let's\nunderstand about some of the features of\ncompute engine which basically offers\nscalable high performance virtual\nmachines which are configurable and\nwhich runs in Google's data center with\naccess to high performance networking\ninfrastructure and block storage so from\nhere you can select VM for your needs\nfor your general purpose or workload\noptimized predefined or custom machines\nnow here you can integrate compute with\nother Google cloud services such as AI\nML and other data analytics Services you\nhave different machines which are\noffered here such as general purpose\nwhich provide a balance between price\nand performance which are well suited\nfor most workloads including line of\nbusiness applications web services and\ndatabases you also have compute\noptimized machines which offer\nconsistent high-end virtual CPU core\nperformance and which are mainly good\nfor gaming Eda High process Computing\nand other such applications apart from\ngeneral purpose compute optimized you\nalso have memory optimized machines\nwhich offer highest amount ount of\nmemory and these VMS are basically well\nsuited for inmemory databases such as\nsap Hana realtime analytics and inmemory\ncache now we can see these options here\nyou can click on VM instances while\nyou're logged in into your Google Cloud\nconsole here you can even create an\ninstance template which can be used to\nspin up instances for example if I click\non new VM instance from a template there\nare some templates which have already\ncreated for my usage now here I can\nbasically use one of these templates or\nwhat I can do is I can go back I can go\ninto instance templates and this\nbasically allows me to create a template\nso you can click on create instance\ntemplate which basically allows you to\ncreate templates which can be used to\nspin up different instances we can give\na name to the template for example we\ncan say template instance now here I can\nchoose choose machine configurations and\nthis is where you have different options\nso you have general purpose as I\nmentioned which provide a balance\nbetween price and performance you have\nmemory optimized which are large memory\nmachine types for memory intensive\nworkloads you also have compute\noptimized which basically give you high\nperformance machine types for compute\nintensive workloads so you can choose\nany machine configuration which is\navailable here based on your\nrequirements now if you click on general\npurpose that has different options here\nso you look into the series where you\nhave N1 series you have E2 which are CPU\nplatform selection based on availability\nyou have N2 and n2d so let's just have\nN1 selected now you also have here which\ntalks about machine types and here we\ncan choose the configuration which we\nare interested in depending on the\napplications which will run within the\nmachines we can choose a ma machine so\nby default it shows one virtual CPU core\nand 3.5 GB of memory or Ram you could\nchoose a higher end machine so as of now\nI'll just say N1 standard now that\nbasically allows me to choose these\nmachines so there are different features\nwhich your computer offers such as you\nhave live migration for VMS you have\npreemptable virtual machines you have so\ntenant nodes and all those options can\nbe seen here now in this machine for my\nboot dis I can select SE a distribution\nwhich I would be interested in for\nexample I could be going for public\nimages and I can choose for example u 2\nand then I can choose a version so it\nshows me\n16.04 and you also have latest version\nsuch as u220 you can choose one of these\nand here it asks you to choose the boot\ndisk type so that could be standard\npersistant disk which is hdds which are\nlow in performance and uh um you can say\nlow in cost in comparison to ssds so\nssds give you better performance but\nthen they are little expensive than\nusing standard persistent disk we can\nchoose this and we can give a disk size\nfor example 20 gab and I can click on\nselect before clicking on select I can\nclick on custom images and that shows me\nif you have any other images created in\nyour project you could use those you\ncould also learn about images by\nclicking on this link so we'll click on\nPublic Image es we have chosen this\ndistribution let's do a select and now\nhere you have identity and API access\nmanagement so let this be default you\ncan say allow default access and what\nyou need is depending on the services we\ncan choose it allows HTTP and https\ntraffic now we would also need some way\nto connect to these machines so when you\nset up an instance by default you can do\nSSH into it using the Google Cloud\nconsole or from cloud shell you can also\ngive a private and a public key so here\nyou have the option where you can give\nall these details so when it comes to\nmanagement it tells you would would you\nwant to go for reservations and you can\nsay automatically use created\nreservation you could also say no you\nwould not want to use a reservation you\ncan also set up or provide a startup\nscript which you would want to give\nwhenever your machines come up and here\nyou have the options of preempt ability\nso compute offers preemptable virtual\nmachines so that is mainly when you\nwould want to run bad jobs and fault\ntolerant workloads on these machines and\nyou can benefit with a reduced cost for\nyour virtual CPU and memory by\n80% so these are virtual machines which\nwould be lasting less than 24 hours now\nby default this is off and it purely\ndepends on your workload what you would\nwant to run on these instances I I could\njust go ahead and select preemptible\nbeing on that and use this feature of\ncompute you also have on host\nmaintenance which talks about what would\nbe happening with this compute engine\ninstance so when compute engine performs\nperiodic infrastructure maintenance it\ncan migrate your VM instances to other\nhardware and this is one of the features\nwhich compute engine offers which we\ncall as live migration for VMS here your\ncomputer engine can live migrate between\nhost systems that is the underlying\nsystems on which these VM instances are\nbased on without rebooting which will\nkeep your application running even when\nhost system require maintenance and here\nit says migrate VM instense recommended\nand let that be as it is you can also\nsay that if there is a maintenance\nhappening you can terminate the VM\ninstance now it also talks about\nautomatic restart which is on which\nbasically means computer engine can\nautomatically restart VM instances if\nthey are terminated from nonuser\ninitiated reasons so these are all the\nsettings which are available in\nmanagement and it also tells us the\ndifferent features which we have there\nis also a feature called sold tency\nwhich basically means sold tenant sold\ntenant nodes which can be chosen so you\ncan have physical compute engine servers\ndedicated exclusively for your use and\nthis is usually good when you're talking\nabout bring your own license\napplications so soul nodes give you\naccess to same machine types and VM\nconfiguration options as regular compute\ninstances however these might be a\nlittle expensive we can choose this one\nwe can also look into networking which\nbasically shows the default setup which\ngoes for auto subnet you can also choose\na particular IP if that is required but\nthat would cost more you can click on\ndiss which talk about what do you want\nto do with the boot dis when the\ninstance is deleted what is the\nencryption mechanism you would want to\nuse and here finally you have security\nso basically as I said you can SSH into\ninstance using the cloud console option\nand you can also provide a public SSH\nkey so one way of doing that if you\nintend to use an external SSH client\nsuch as puty to connect you can create a\nkey so for example I can go into puty\ngen and here I can say generate just\nmove my cursor over here and that will\ncreate a key I can give a name to this\none so I'll say sdu will be username\nI'll give a simple password which I will\nuse to login to this machine and then I\ncan save this private key which will get\nsaved so let's say hdu new key and this\ngets saved in a PPK file which is\nusually used when you use an external\nSSH client to connect so save this one\nand that saves a PP PK file on your\ndesktop what you can also do is you can\ncopy this public key content from here\nand this is what we would want to give\nin our instance here so so that the\npublic key gets stored on the instance\nand private key is what we will use to\nconnect so once I paste it here it\nresolves the name to hdu and we have\ngiven the public key now in certain\ncases you may want to use a software\nwhich uses s Ed to connect to the\nmachine and that software might not be\nsuch as your puty so in that case you\nmay want a pem file or a private key\nwhich is saved as a pem file so you can\nalso do that by going to conversions and\ndo a export open SSH key and then save\nit so I'll say hdu new key but then this\none will be saved as a pem file on my\nmachine so you have PPK file which\nallows you to use puty to connect to the\ninstance you have a pem in case a\nsoftware needs directly SSH to these\nmachines you also have the public key\nwhich we have already provided in the\nmachine now once this is done I can\nclose puty genen I can go back to this\npage where I'm creating an instance\ntemplate and then I can just click on\ncreate so this has created a instance\ntemplate which I can use to spin up my\ninstances any number of instances using\nthe same template only thing which I\nwould have to do is change that region\nwhere I would want the instance to run\nso now that we have created instance and\nthat's my this one the third option I\ncan go back to VM instances now I can\nclick on Create and here I can either\ncreate an instance from scratch by\ngiving all the details again or I can\njust use my template so I can click on\nnew VM instance from a template choose\nmy template click on continue and once\nthis is done I can give my instance name\nso let's say c one I can choose the\nregion so I will choose Frankfurt and\nthen rest everything is autop populated\nbased on the template what you have\ngiven and you click on create now this\nbasically allows you to spin up an\ninstance and you can create any number\nof instances using your template you\ncould have already created a new\ninstance right from scratch now once the\ninstance is created this has a public IP\nand a private IP private IP will not\nchange unless you would want to set up a\nnew machine but public IP will change\nevery time you stop and start the\nmachine now this is what we need to\nconnect to this machine I can also do a\nSSH from here by doing this in open in a\nbrowser window let's click on this so\nthis is an internal way of connecting to\nyour instance using SSH let's wait\nbecause it would be transferring the SSH\nkeys to the VM it establishes a\nconnection and I'm connected to my\nmachine what we can easily do is to\nconfirm firm if we are in the right\nmachine we can just do a LS to look at\nthe file system what we can also do is\nwe can basically log in as root by doing\na pseudo Su and that allows you to get\ninto the machine as root and from here I\ncan switch to hdu user which will have a\nSSH directory in home and that basically\nhas authorized keys and if we would want\nto see if this one contains my public\nkey I can just to a cat. SSH and then\nlook into authorized keys and this shows\nme the public key which we had initially\nadded to our instance so this confirms\nthat we are logged into the machine\nwhich we created now I can close this\nand what I can also do is I can copy\nthis public IP so let's do a copy to\nclickbuy and here I will say host name\nwhere I'll say hdu give my public key\nI'll click on SSH and in SSH I'll go to\nauthentication now here we need to give\nour PPK file so the PPK file was sdu new\nkey select this one come back here come\nto the session give it a name for\nexample C1 save it and then you can just\nsay open and say yes and you are logged\nin to your machine now once you're\nlogged in you can always do a minus SSH\nand that shows you the file so this is\nhow you have just used the compu engine\nto spin up an instance but we used a\ntemplate which basically allowed me to\ncreate this instance and then I can\nconnect to this instance and then I can\nstart working on this so when we talk\nabout features of computer engine it has\npredefined machine types as we saw so\ncomputer engine offers different\npredefined virtual machines and this\nthey have configurations for every need\nfrom small general purpose instances to\nlarge memory optimized instances with up\nto 11.5 tab of ram you can have fast\ncompute instances optimized up to 60\nvirtual CPU course you also have custom\nmachine types so you can create a VM\nthat best fits your workload and by\ntailoring a custom machine type to your\nspecific need you can realize\nsignificant savings there are\npreemptible VMS which we saw there is\nalso a facility which allows you to take\nthe benefit of live migration for VMS\nyou have durable high performance block\nstorage for virtual machine instances in\nthe form of persistent diss where data\nis stored redundantly for integrity\nflexibility and to resize storage\nwithout interruption and you could be\nchoosing sdds or sdds for your instances\nnow you also have option such as GPU\naccelerators so for example if I just\nclick on create instance and I can look\ninto that so here let the instance name\nbe instance one and what I would be\ninterested in looking at this one which\nsays CPU platform and GPU so CPU\nplatform configuration is permanent you\ncan also do add GPU so gpus can be added\nto accelerate computationally intensive\nworkloads like machine learning\nsimulation medical analysis and virtual\nworkstation applications so you can add\nand remove gpus to a VM when your\nworkload changes and pay for GPU only\nwhile you using so these are some of the\nfeatures which basically compute engine\noffers and we already know that Google\nbills in second level increments so we\nonly pay for the compute time now there\nare different savings which are possible\nso you have commitment savings which\nbasically means you can save up to 57%\nwith up upfront cost per instance type\nlockin you have container support so you\ncan basically run manage and orchestrate\nDocker containers or compute engine\ninstances so here when we are setting up\nour instances there is an option which\nbasically allows you to use or deploy\nDocker images now that can be done you\ncan also benefit from sustained use\nsavings that is sustained use discounts\nwhich are automatic discounts for\nrunning compute engine resources for\nsignificant portion of the billing month\nyou can create a reservation for VM\ninstance in a specific Zone which is\nbasically seen under your management\nsection here and you can ensure your\nproject has resources for future\nincreases in demand and if no longer\nneeded delete the reservation so these\nare some of the features of compute\nengine what we have done is we have\ncreated computer engine using the\nconsole now you can go back you can also\ndo that using Cloud shell and you can\nclick on this one which activates Cloud\nshell you could also have the cloud SD\ncas support on setup on your machine\nwhich can be used now I can just open\nthis in a new window and from here I can\nstart giving commands if I would be\ninterested in setting up an instance\nfrom my command line so here you have\ndifferent options now to begin with you\ncan just do a gcloud and just hit enter\nand that will show you different options\nwhich are available which can be used so\nyou have g-cloud compute here which\nshows an option to create and manipulate\ncompute engine resources now I can just\ndo a q to quit I can do gcloud compute\nand that basically will again show me\ndifferent options which are available if\nyou would be interested in setting up\ninstances from the command line so here\nI can say gcloud compute and then go for\ninstances and if you do not know the\ncommands you can just hit enter that\nwill show you all the different options\nwhich we have so here we have different\noptions such as list or create or start\nor update for example I can just do a\nlist here to see what instances I have\nand the instance which we just created\nshows up here it says that say status is\nrunning I can just stop this instance I\ncan delete this instance I can even\ncreate an instance by using a create\ncommand here and you can just do a\ncreate help which will show you what the\ndifferent options you can give so it\nsays instance name is what you need you\ncan choose an accelerator you can choose\nthe boot dis and various other options\nso I can just say create and then I can\ngive a name for example C2 and once I\nclick on this one it says did you mean\nEurope West for zone so it is asking me\nfor the region and the zone and I can\nsay yes and these settings are coming\nfrom my default profile I can always\nchange those by changing the metadata so\nnow we have created an instance it says\nrunning if we do a list again to see we\nsee two instances created one was in\nEurope West 3 one was in Europe W West 4\nboth of them have internal and external\nIPS now you can do a describe to look at\nthe different options here so g-cloud\nbasically allows you different commands\nwhich you can use to to work with your\ninstance to create instances to change\nthe metadata if you would want to change\nthe region if you would want to add a\nstartup script all those options are\npossible from the command line which we\ncan learn in detail in later sessions so\nthis is your compute engine as a service\nnow that we have learned about the\ncompute domain and G compute Services\nwhich is offered by gcp let's also learn\nabout about storage and databases that's\nagain within the storage domain and the\nservices which are offered by Google\nCloud platform now you can go back to\nconsole and here you can click on this\none and here you can just scroll down to\nsee what are the different options in\nstorage so you have options such as big\ntable you have data store fire store\nfile store you have SQL Based Services\nyou have storage which is object storage\nand then you have other options which\nare available so Google Cloud platform\noffers different storage Based Services\nout of which storage which is your\nobject storage is quite popular one\nclick on storage and that basically\nshows you an option which talks about\nstorage browser so this is your Google\nCloud's object storage so when we talk\nabout object storage it is basically a\nstorage where you could store any kind\nof data and when we talk about Object\nStore storage it is a bunch of bytes\nwhich we address wherein every object\nwill have a unique key these unique keys\nare in the form of URL which allows you\nto access the object so cloud storage is\ncomprised of what we call as buckets\nwhich are used to store and hold your\nstorage objects the storage objects are\nimmutable and every change creates a new\nversion now you can also have control\naccess via IM am that is identity access\nmanagement or via Access Control list so\nthere is also an option called object\nversioning which basically says if it is\non every time you try to store the same\nobject a new version of the object would\nbe created otherwise newer option will\noverride old one as we cannot archive\nthe old version so let's see how we work\nwith this object storage so here you can\nclick on create bucket now once you\nclick on create bucket it needs a name\nso let's say test bucket and here I can\njust give say number one so that says\nthis is the name of my bucket now I can\ndirectly click on continue or it would\nbe good to look at different options\nwhich are available here so when you\nclick on choose where to store your data\nso it already gives me an option it says\nthe bucket name is already taken so let\nme give it a unique name so let's say\ntest buck and let's call it AUA so that\nshould be unique now here it says choose\nwhere to store your data so this one\ngives you location type so you can have\nregion specific buckets which give you\nlowest latency that is fastest response\ntime within a single region however it\ndoes not make your storage highly\navailable you can make a dual region\nwhich is basically allowing your bucket\nor storage to be accessible across\nregions you can also make it multi-\nregion which is highest availability\noffered as of now we can choose region\nspecific and now it asks you to choose a\nlocation now as always I will choose\nFrankfurt now I can click on continue\nand rest all the rest let all the\nstorage options be default or you can\nclick on a default storage class now\nthat tells you based on your storage\nclass there are variant costs when it\ncomes to storing retrieving or doing any\nkind of operations so you have a\nstandard option which says best for\nshort-term storage and frequently Access\nData you can also go for Cold Storage\nsuch as near line which is best for\nbackups and data access less than once a\nmonth you can go for freezing storage\nsuch as cold line best for disaster\nrecovery and data access less than once\na quarter or you can go for archiving\nwhere the data is accessed less than\nonce a year let's go for standard as of\nnow and now you can choose how to\ncontrol access to objects so you have\nfine grained or uniform let it be fine\ngrained wherein you can give additional\npermissions at Bucket Level using IM am\nor object level permissions using access\ncontrol list in advanced settings you\ncan choose the encryption and you can\nalso choose a retention policy so a\nretention policy to specify the minimum\nduration that this buckets objects must\nbe protected from deletion or\nmodification after they are uploaded you\ncan always learn about this more by\nclicking here now once I've chosen all\nthe relevant options I can click on\nCreate and that basically will create a\nbucket by the name I have given I can\nclick on overview to basically see brief\ndetails about my bucket such as region\nwhat is the default storage class and it\nalso shows you the link URL which can be\nused to access your bucket it also gives\nyou the link for GS util now GS util is\na command which can be used in your\nCloud shell to basically work with your\nbuckets you can click on permissions to\nbasically see what kind of permissions\nare already in place and you can then\nmake changes you can basically add\nmembers you can view by different roles\nso for example here by default it shows\nother services such as data proc or your\nbucket owner or bucket reader related\npermissions which have been already\ngranted now once I've looked at my\nbucket I can start using it I can drag\nand drop and push in files here so as of\nnow there are no live objects in my\nobject storage that is in my bucket what\nI can do is I can click on upload files\nand then I can choose a location from my\nmachine for example I'll go into data\nsets and what I can do is I can choose\nsome of the files here in any format\nlet's choose CSV or text and just do\nopen so this one will basically upload\nmy data sets here now once I've uploaded\nthe files I can basically close this one\nI can look into options here which says\nedit permissions edit metadata if you\nwould want to download it if you would\nwant to copy move or rename it if you\nwould want to export to a different\nservice called Cloud Pub sub which is\npublish subscribing messaging system you\ncan scan the data now you can click on a\nparticular file and that basically shows\nyou the URL which basically allows you\nto access this file you can try copying\nthis you can click on download and\ndownload this file you can even try\naccessing this from public and that\nbasically shows you the content of this\nfile based on the permissions so this is\nB basically your object storage which is\none of the service which is offered what\nyou can also do is you can create\nfolders and within folders you can then\nupload your data so this is your Google\nCloud Storage option which is for your\nobject storage that is you can add\ndifferent items you can give different\npermissions and you can use this Google\nCloud platforms storage service offering\nnow you also have other options such as\nbig table and we can go into that by\nclicking here and click on big table so\nbig table is one of the service which\nkickstarted nosql databases today in\nMarket we see different nosql databases\nsuch as cassendra hbas mongod DB couch\nDB Neo 4J and many others so you can\nbasically use big table which was the\nPioneer when it comes to your no SQL\ndatabases or not only SQL databases so\nthe problem initially faced by Google\nwas that uh the web indexes behind\nsearch engine were taking too long to\nbuild so company wanted to build\ndatabase that would provide realtime\naccess to petabytes of data and that's\nwhere big table began so big table\npowers different other Google services\nsuch as Gmail Google Maps and other\nservices and in\n2015 it was launched as is a service for\ncustomers so when it comes to\nscalability with use of big table you\ncan increase your machine count without\nany downtime and you can handle admin\ntasks like upgrades restarts and so on\nwhich are basically taken care by the\ncloud provider data present in Cloud big\ntable is encrypted and you can use IM\nroles to specify access so data written\nto or from big table is through data\nservice layer\nsuch as managed virtual machines hbas\nrest servers Java Services hbas client\nand so on here if I would want to use\nbig table I can click on create instance\nand that basically tells me Cloud\nbigtable instance is a container for\nyour clusters now here you can give a\ninstance name so for example I will say\nAUA and then say for example test and\nlet's say big table so that will be the\nname of instance this will be permanent\nyou can choose the storage type again\nyou can go for lower latency more rows\nred per second typically used for\nrealtime serving use cases or you can go\nfor sdds which have higher latency for\nrandom reads good performance on scans\nand typically used for batch analytics\nso let's go for ssds as of now here you\nhave cluster ID which is autop populated\nyou can choose a region so let's go for\nour favorite one here where I can say\nEurope West 3 I can choose a Zone here\nand I can then choose how many nodes\nwould I want to use for my big table so\nwhen you talk about big table service it\nwill have a cluster underlying which\nwill have various nodes which will\ncontrol your data throughput storage and\nrows read per second so as of now let it\nbe just one node and that's enough for\nour demo when we talk about performance\nit basically tells you based on the\ncurrent node and storage type it tells\nyou how many reads can happen at\nmillisecond so it says 10,000 rows per\nsecond at 6 millisecond you have rights\nwhich are 10,000 rows per second or you\nhave scans which are 220 megabytes per\nsecond storage which is taken care here\nwould be 2.5 tabt and I can then\nbasically click on create now there is\nalso some option called replication\nguidance which basically says replic for\ncloud table big table copies your data\nacross multiple regions enabling you to\nisolate workload and increase the\navailability and durability of your data\ndepending on your use case you can have\nbig table which can be used to have your\ndata across regions now you can click on\ncreate with all your specifications\nChosen and that's going to set up a\ncluster or you can say a fully managed\nnosql database which will give you low\nlatency and replication for High\navailability now once we have a new\ninstance you can connect to it with the\nCBT command line tool and for\ninstructions you can click on learn more\nhere you can just click on this instance\nID to see the details again if you would\nwant to look into your big table setup\nso it tells me here that we have one\ninstance what is the CPU utilization\ntime how many rows were read or written\nwhat is the throughput and this is autop\npopular ated based on your usage you can\nclick on monitoring and that basically\nwill give you different widgets which\nwill display information for your CPU\nutilization what is your hottest node\ndepending on how many nodes you have\nsystem errors automatic failovers\nstorage utilization and so on you can\nclick on key visualizer which will allow\nyou to look into your table if you have\nalready created some data here and you\ncan click on tables to see how many\ntables you have added here here so\nthat's in brief about your big tables\nwhich is one thing which we need to\nremember is it's not good for all use\ncases so should be used for low latency\naccess that is fast access and good if\nat least data is greater than 1 terabyte\nfor smaller amount of data the overhead\nis too high so big tables performance\nwill suffer if you store individual\nelements larger than 10 megabytes if you\nwant to store bigger objects such as\nimages video files then go for object\nstorage and that would be a better\noption so always remember big table is\nnot a relational database it's a nosql\ndatabase and when you talk about multi\ntransactions or online transaction\nprocessing big table is not the right\nchoice so it can be used for wide range\nof applications especially when you talk\nabout your olap that is online\nanalytical processing so it is designed\nto store key value Pairs and there can\nbe different use cases so for example if\nyou're using something like cloud data\nflow or cloud data proc where you would\nwant map reduce kind of operations big\ntable can act as a good storage because\nit has very high throughput and\nscalability and the best thing is that\nit supports hbas API thus allowing easy\nintegration with Apache Hadoop and Spark\nclusters which you can bring up using\none more service which Google Cloud\nplatform offers which is called cloud\ndata proc so big table is good for\nrealtime analytics it's commonly seen in\nfinancial services iot and others and if\nyou are thinking of running interactive\nSQL then big table would not be the\nright choice but the other choice would\nbe big query you should also remember\nthat this has a cluster running and you\nwould be charged if this cluster kept on\nrunning so you have to be very careful\nin your free account when you're using\nsuch Services now we have clicked on\nthis one so I can select this one and\nbasically I can look at the permissions\nI can look at the labels I can look at\ninherited permissions here I can also\nclick on my\ninstance which we created and either you\ncan edit or you can just do a delete so\nas of now we will just delete this which\nneeds you to give the name so we'll say\nAUA test BT and then click on delete so\nwhenever you are trying out different\nServices the first approach should be\nsetting up these different Services\nseeing how they work basically trying\nconnecting to them and once you are\nsatisfied with the initial test then you\ncan plan your actions and come back and\nuse the service for a longer duration\nnow that's your big table which is one\nof the offerings we can go back into\nstorage and here you have other options\nwhich are available so for example we\nwere in big table you also have an\noption such as cloud data store now\nthat's one more service which is offered\nby Google Cloud platform when it comes\nto storage domain so Google added\nsoftware on top of big table which\nsupports more than simple key value\npairs when you talk about secondary\nindexes instead of just having having\none primary index when you talk about\nasset properties for Reliable\ntransactions such as SQL query like\nlanguage so these features or these\nServices were added to or on top of your\nbig table which gave birth to a new\nservice which was released as cloud data\nstore so this is where you have cloud\ndata store and you can select a CL Cloud\nfire store mode so you can go for a\nnative mode enable all Cloud fire stores\nfeatures Fe with offline support or you\ncan go for Cloud's data store system on\ntop of Cloud's fire store so these are\ndifferent options here and here we look\nat the API or scalability engine support\nhow many rights it supports and so on\nyou can choose one of these and then you\ncan choose where to store your data so\nfor example if I click on this one then\nit choose asks me to choose a location\nso it says the location of your database\neffect its cost availability and\ndurability choose a regional location\nlower right latency lower cost or multi-\nregion location here I can basically\nchoose for example Europe and then I can\ngo ahead and create a database so it\nsays initializing Cloud fire store in\ndata store mode services in eu3 this\nusually takes a few minutes you'll be\nredirect to your database once it is\nready so if we compare the pricing\nstructure between cloud data store and\nCloud big table always remember cloud\ndata store you pay for monthly storage\nwhich is also in the case of big table\nhowever here you are paying for monthly\nstorage for reads and writs but in case\nof big table you're paying for cluster\nwhen it is running so cloud data store\nis a good option for small data\ninfrequent access and it acts cheaper\nwhen you talk about large amount of data\nor big data and frequent access then you\nare talking about cloud big table so big\ntable is cheaper when you talk about\nlarger amount of data so here it says\nsince your database is empty you can\nstill switch to Cloud fire store in\nNative mode to get more features you\ncould do that you could learn you could\nsay query by\ngql as of now we don't have any data\nhere let's look at the dashboard which\nsays since your database is empty you\ncan still switch to cloudfire store in\nNative mode to get more features so this\nis your cloud data store and it has many\nfeatures which help you to work with\nyour data however some features or\nimportant features of rdbms's were still\nmissing and that's where Google created\nyet another big table based service\ncalled Cloud spanner now we can continue\nworking on cloud data store which\nbasically gives you one option to work\nwith your data you can create an entity\nhere by clicking on create entity and\nthat basically gives you options such as\ndefault name space you can give a kind\nyou can give numeric ID and you can\nstart adding properties but to learn\nmore about data store we will learn\nabout this in further sessions so as of\nnow I'm going to click on cancel I'm\ngoing to go back to my data store and\nthis basically let's go to data store\noption or I can go into admin here which\nbasically says if you have any entities\nyou can import or export them so let's\ngo back and let's again look into\nstorage options so as of now we were in\ndata store let's click on this one so as\nI mentioned your cloud data store which\nbasically gives you some additional\nfeatures on top of your big table but\nwhat Google also did was it realized\nthat there was a need for rdbms feature\nsupport that is there were lot of featur\nFe es now here we have created a data\nstore and it says your datab base is\nready to go just add data you can create\nentity start putting in data and then\nyou can go ahead and query this so if\nyou would want to learn more about your\ndata store you can just click on this\none and that takes you to the complete\ndocumentation of native mode and data\nstore mode what is fire store in Native\nmode what is in data store mode what are\npricing and locations how you choose a\ndatabase mode what are the feature\ncomparison ions what you can do what you\nare allowed to do here what programming\nlanguages can be used different regions\npricing and so on as of now we'll click\non this one and let's look at one\nAdvanced service which Google Cloud came\nup with when it comes to your additional\nfeatures of rdbms so Google created yet\nanother big table based service called\nCloud spanner now that you might not see\nhere but if you scroll down you should\nbe able to see your Cloud spanner in the\noptions here or did we miss it on the\ntop so let's again look here yeah so it\nis here and you can click on spanner so\nCloud spanner was released in 2017 it\nbasically supports relational schema so\nit offers strong consistency for all\nqueries which can be SQL based you can\nhave multi- region deployment now when\nit comes to massive scalability\nrequirement and strong consistency Cloud\nspanner is a good option so it says\nCloud spanner is a managed Mission\ncritical globally consistent and\nscalable relational database so if you\nwould want to use this then you will\nhave to enable this API where it shows\nyou an option here it says try this API\nso it's a managed service so it is one\nof the Google's most expensive database\nServices there is also one more database\nservice which is cloudsql which can be\nused so when we talk about your Cloud\nspan\nit is fully managed relational database\nservice it is massively distributed you\ncan have millions of machines across\nhundreds of data centers with support\nautomatic sharding and synchronous\nreplication it gives you low latency and\nschema updates without Dum time making\ndata High availability and reliability\nso we'll learn about Cloud spanner with\nmore details later in other sessions now\nwe can also go back to storage and we\ncan look at the different options which\nwe have here so you have object storage\nyou have spanner you also have your SQL\nbased service which is yet another\nmanage service offered by cloud or\nGoogle Cloud I would say so that's\ncalled cloudsql so this is basically a\nservice which allows you to have fully\nmanage relational MySQL postgress and\nSQL Server databases Google handles\nreplication patch management database\nmanagement and other things which are\nrelated to this managed or fully managed\ndatabase service it can allow you to\nhandle terabytes of storage capacity\nwith\n40,000 iops with huge amount of ram per\ninstance so you can click on create\ninstance here and then you can choose\none of the database which you would want\nto use so cloudsql is a managed service\nyou can choose one of your MySQL or\npostgress and SQL Server say for example\nI choose MySQL now that basically tells\nme what is the instance ID it sets up a\npassword you can always change the\npassword you can change the region you\ncan choose your database version and\nthen you can also look at other\nconfiguration options which talk about\nmachine type which will be used what is\nabout your backup and Recovery\nmaintenance and all that and if you\nclick on create this will basically\ncreate a fully managed SQL service which\ncan allow you to straight away start\nusing MySQL on cloud thus allowing you\nto store your relational data when we\ntalk about storage options how can we\nnot talk about a data warehouse solution\nor basically an option which allows you\nto run your queries by directly updating\ndata so you can use a data warehouse\nservice which Google Cloud platform\noffers and that's called big query so\nbasically you can be looking into the\nBig Data section here and here you have\nan option called Big query so this\nbasically brings ease of implementation\nand speed so building your own data\nWeare house can be expensive time\nconsuming and difficult to scale so with\nbig query you just load data and pay\nonly for what you use so it when it\ncomes to Features you have features such\nas capability to process billions of\nrows in seconds and if you would want to\ndo realtime analysis of streaming data\nthat is also possible here so here we\nhave clicked on big query which\nbasically shows you the option where you\ncan start typing your query and test\nyour data access for example if I have\nuploaded some data so it shows me there\nare some queries which are saved here\nnow I can schedule your query I can\nbasically choose the format of a\nparticular query by clicking on this\nmore here I have an option which says\nadd data so I can pin it to a particular\nproject I can explore public data sets I\ncan create a connection so if I click on\nexplore public data sets then it takes\nme to a page from where you can get\ndifferent kind of data sets which are\nalready available which you can put into\nyour big query and start querying your\ndata by default it shows that it is\naligned to my project and I don't need\nto worry about it I can look at saved\nquery if I have already saved a\nparticular query I can look at job\nhistory I can look at transfers\nscheduled queries and reservations so\nbig query basically initially had its\nown version of SQL which was slightly\ndifferent from standard SQL but in 2016\nbig query 2 was released that supports\nSQL 2011 standard you can always select\nstandard SQL now big query when it comes\nto pricing we need to remember that the\nstorage is the storage cost is very less\nhere approximately 02 cents per GB per\nmonth it is almost similar to near line\nwhere you can also have low cost that is\n01 cents per gigabyte per month there is\nno charge for reading data from Storage\nwhen it comes to querying and that's\nwhere the cost is incurred so one\nterabyte per month is free and after\nthat it costs few cents per gigabyte so\nthis is mainly for high volume customers\nthere is a flat rate pricing which can\nbe used so when you talk about querying\nyou can save your query results you can\ncreate data set to store the results now\nresults are put in a temp table in Cache\nand after you are done with that you can\ndelete data set and delete all the data\nso when you talk about loading data into\nbig query you can get the data from\ncloud storage Google Drive cloud data\nstore stack driver stack uh driver other\noptions you have Cloud big table or\nother web interfaces so you can download\nfrom URL such as CSV Json AO you can\ncreate data set create table and create\nfrom Source by doing a file upload so 10\nmegabyte or less files can be uploaded\nusing web interface as an option you can\nalso use command line and then you can\nstart working with your big query so\nhere you can also work with streaming\ndata by basically pushing in streaming\ndata into your big query which allows\nyou to add one record at a time now you\ncould use something like cloud data flow\nwhich allows you to use a particular\npipeline about cloud data flow we will\nlearn later so you can benefit from\ndifferent features of big query and thus\nuse Google's offering to work on your\nstructured data or I would say data\nwhich suits well in data warehouses now\nthese are some of the storage related\nServices which Google Cloud offers\nalthough we will learn about using big\nquery and running or uploading some data\nby creating add data set here by say\ncreating connection or using a public\ndata set so as of now I have this you\ncan also access the command line to work\nwith this but we will learn in detail\nabout big query in later sessions now\nhere you can scroll down and you also\nhave an option within Big Data space and\nthat is your data proc so when you talk\nabout data proc this is again a manage\nservice which allows you to run spark or\nHadoop jobs so especially if you are\ninterested in Big Data workload so for\nbig data processing for machine learning\nyou can always use cloud data proc this\nuses compute engine instances under the\nhood but takes care of management of\nthese instances so it's a it's a layer\non top to spin UPF clusters it's a\nmanage service it's cheaper pay when the\njobs are running only it's fast because\nit it is integrated with other Google\ncloud services you have open- Source\ncomponents pre-installed and data proc\nis integrated with Yan to make cluster\nmanagement easier when you talk about\ndata proc you can click on create\ncluster and that basically allows you to\nset up your cluster by choosing a\nparticular region which you would want\nto use for example I'll choose Europe\nWest 4 here it tells what kind of\nmachines you would want to use and by\ndefault it has pop pated as the machine\nhere which is 4 CPU and 15 GB now since\nyou might be using a free account let's\nnot go for the high-end machine let's go\nfor N1 standard 2 and then you can\nscroll down it says what is the primary\ndis what is the disk type and this one\nwas for your master machine that is\nmachine which will have the master\nprocesses running then you have your\nworker node configuration which tells\nthis will be let's choose a lower end\nmachine and we can choose how many\nworker notes you would have so it says\nminimum two you can choose the ssds and\ntheir capacity it talks about yarn cores\nand yarn memory which will be allocated\nand here we have then option of clicking\non create so once you click on create\nthis will basically spin up a cluster\nwherein you can straight away start\nsubmitting jobs to this you can\nbasically go ahead once you cluster is\nready you can go into the cluster you\ncan submit a job you can choose a type\nwhich is spark or any other application\nwhich you would want to run and then\nbasically you can use this fully managed\nservice which allows you to run your big\ndata clusters you can obviously control\naccess via roles or Access Control list\nand you can have access as it is at\nproject level or based on your data proc\ncluster or even at your worker notes so\nwe'll learn about data proc in later\nsessions so as of now you see here the\ncluster is getting created it says the\ncloud storage bucket which it is using\nis this one now I can click on this and\nopen link in a new tab it still takes me\ninto console but now it is showing me\nthe bucket which is being used by your\ndata proc cluster this is the bucket\nwhich is being used and it is being used\nfor un underlying metadata which gets\nstored here so you look at the cluster\nrelated folders you can click in these\nfolders and then it can see what is the\nscript output what it is doing and so on\nnow I can come back here to my bucket\nwhich will basically show me what kind\nof buckets have been created so you see\ndata proc service automatically created\nsome buckets which will be holding some\ndata you also have some other buckets\nwhich were created based on other\nservices which we used the access\ncontrol is fine grained in all cases\nplus it also shows our bucket so\nunderlying it is using compute instances\nit is basically using let's go here and\nlet's go to compute engine and let's\nlook into VM instances so data proc\nwhich has spun up a cluster is also\nusing the VM instances which we see here\nare running it is using the buckets and\nit has made a cluster ready to use so\nyou can click on this cluster and that\nshows me my cluster related details if\nthere are any jobs running what are VM\ninstances what kind of configurations it\nhas used and you can look at different\ndetails here you can look at the logs\nyou can click on jobs and that will show\nyou if you have basically run a job on\nthis ready to use cluster so it says\nthere is this particular job which was\nrun\nwhich was a spark job you can click on\nsubmit and this one tells you what is\nthe job ID what is the region you would\nchoose for example we will again choose\nfor example Europe West 4 it tells what\nis the job type so you can run all these\ntype of jobs in this cluster such as\nHadoop spark P spark Hive Pig Presto you\ncan give your jar file so if you have\npackaged your application as a jar you\ncan mention that here you can pass in\nsome arguments you can also say some\nother jar files add some properties and\nthen click on submit which will run your\njob on this ready to use cluster now\nsince we have tested it I can basically\ngo ahead and do a delete I don't want to\nincur any cost on these manage services\nwhich are running so there are lot more\ninformation about using these Services\nwhich Google Cloud platform offers and\nwe can continue learning about these\nServices as we explore your Google Cloud\nconsole\nor even your command line option now we\ncan come out of this one by clicking on\nthis menu and then we have other options\nsuch as kubernetes you have Cloud\nfunctions you have your networking\nrelated Services monitoring related\nServices different kind of tools what\nyou have you have other big data\nspecific Services which you can learn\nabout and for each of these service\nGoogle has a very good documentation\navailable for example when you talk\nabout publish subscribe messaging system\nit is a realtime manage service which\nbasically is a Pioneer which was used\nand now you have a famous service such\nas Kafka which is being used for your\npublish subscribing or messaging system\nkind of\nrequirements so to conclude about Google\nCloud platform Services you can always\ngo to cloud.google.com and look into the\ndocument section now here you have list\nof different featured products you also\nhave list of your different domains and\nservices which Google Cloud offers and\nyou can learn about all the different\nServices which are offered by Google\nCloud here you can click on featured\nproducts and that basically shows you\ncompute engine Cloud run cloud storage\nyou have cloudsql big query Vision AI\nyou can scroll down and look at your art\nIAL intelligence and machine learning\nrelated Services platform and\naccelerators API\nmanagement so Google Cloud platform\noffers different services in mainly in\nyour compute storage and databases you\nhave networking related Services Big\nData specifics developer tools Cloud AI\nidentity and Security iot Management\ntools API I platform and so on so\nbasically learn about the gcp services\nwhich Google Cloud platform offers and\nin detail you can play around with\ndifferent Services which are offered by\ncreating a free account and as I\ndemonstrated you can use any one of\nthese Services quick start them\nbasically connect to them put in your\ndata or use a manage service to manage\nyour data and benefit from Google CL\nplatform thus having modernized\ninfrastructure for your different use\ncases hi guys today we' got something\nvery special in store for you we're\ngoing to talk about the best cloud\ncomputing platform available Amazon web\nservices uh Rahul I think you said\nsomething wrong here the best cloud\ncomputing platform is obviously Google\nCloud platform no it isn't AWS has more\nthan 100 services that span a variety of\ndomains all right but Google Cloud\nplatform has cheaper instances what do\nyou have to say about that well I guess\nthere's only one place we can actually\ndiscuss this a boxing ring so guys I'm\nAA and I will be Google Cloud platform\nand I'm Rahul I'll be AWS so welcome to\nfight night this is AWS versus gcp the\nwinner will be chosen on the basis of\ntheir origin and the features they\nprovide their performance in the present\nday and comparing them on the basis of\npricing market share and options the\nthings they give you for free and\ninstance configuration now first let's\ntalk about AWS AWS was launched in 20 04\nand is a cloud service platform that\nhelps businesses grow and scale by\nproviding them services in a number of\ndifferent domains these domains include\ncompute database storage migration\nnetworking and so on a very important\naspect about AWS is its years of\nexperience now AWS has been in the\nmarket a lot longer than any other cloud\nservice platform which means they know\nhow businesses work and how they can\ncontribute to the business growing also\nAWS has over $5.1 billion of Revenue in\nthe last quarter this is a clear\nindication of how much f faith and trust\npeople have in AWS they occupy more than\n40% of the market which is a significant\nchunk of the cloud computing Market they\nhave at least 100 services that are\navailable at the moment which means just\nabout every issue that you have can be\nsolved within AWS service now that was\ngreat but now can we talk about gcp I\nhope you know that gcp was launched very\nrecently in 2011 and it is already\nhelping businesses significantly with a\nsuite of intelligent secure and flexible\nCloud Computing Services it lets you\nbuild deploy and scale applications\nwebsites services on the same\ninfrastructure as Google the intuitive\nuser experience that gcp provides with\ndashboards Wizards is way better in all\nthe aspects gcp has just stepped in the\nmarket and it is already offering a\nmodest number of services and the number\nis rapidly increasing and the cost for a\nCPU instance or Regional storage that\ngcp provides is a whole lot cheaper and\nyou also get a multi-regional cloud\nstorage now what do you have to say on\nthat I'm so glad you asked let's look at\npresent day in fact let's look at the\ncloud market share of the fourth quarter\nof 2017 this will tell you once and for\nall that AWS is the leader when it comes\nto cloud computing Amazon web services\ncontributes 47% of the market share\nothers like Rackspace or Verizon cloud\ncontribute 36% Microsoft aure\ncontributes 10% the Google Cloud\nplatform contributes 4% and IBM software\ncontributes 3% 47% of the market share\nis contributed by AWS do you need me to\nconvince you anymore wait wait wait all\nthat is fine but we only started a few\nyears back and have already grown so\nmuch in such a less span of time haven't\nyou heard the latest news our revenue is\nalready a billion dollars per quarter\nwait for a few more years and the world\nshall see and AWS makes $5.3 billion per\nquarter it's going to take a good long\ntime before you can even get close to us\nyes yes we'll see now let's compare a\nfew things for starters let's compare\nprices for AWS a computer instance of 2\nCPUs and 8 GB Ram costs approximately\n$68 now a computer instance is a virtual\nmachine in which you can specify what\noperating system Ram or storage you want\nto have for cloud storage it costs 2.3\ncents per GB per month with AWS you\nreally want to do that because gcp wins\nthis hands down let's take the same\ncompute instance of two CPUs with 8 GB\nRam it will cost approximately $50 per\nmonth with gcp and as for my\ncalculations that's a 25% annual cost\nreduction when compared to AWS talking\nabout cloud storage cost it is only 2\ncents per GB per month with gcp what\nelse do you want me to say let's talk\nabout market share and options now AWS\nis the current market leader when it\ncomes to cloud computing now as you\nremember we contribute at least 47% of\nthe entire market share AWS also has at\nleast 100 services available at the\nmoment which is a clear indication of\nhow well AWS understands businesses and\nhelps them grow yeah that's true but you\nshould also know that gcp is steadily\ngrowing we have over 60 services that\nare up and running as you can see here\nand a lot more to come it's only a\nmatter of time when we will have as many\nservices as you do many companies have\nalready started adopting gcp as a cloud\nservice provider now let's talk about\nthings you get for free with AWS you get\naccess to almost all the services for an\nentire year with usage limits now these\nlimits include an hourly or by the\nminute basis for example with Amazon ec2\nyou get 750 hours per month you also\nhave limits on the number of request to\nservices for example with AWS Lambda you\nhave 1 million requests per month now\nafter these limits are crossed you get\ncharged standard rates with gcp you get\naccess to all Cloud platform products\nlike Firebase the Google Maps API and so\non you also get $300 in credit to spend\nover a 12 Monon period on all the cloud\nplatform products and interestingly\nafter the free trial ends you won't be\ncharged unless you manually upgrade to a\npaid account now there is also Al the\nalways free version for which you will\nneed an upgraded billing account here\nyou get to use a small instance for free\nand 5gb of cloud storage any usage above\nthis always free usage limits will be\nautomatically built at standard rates\nnow let's talk about how you can\nconfigure instances with AWS the largest\ninstance that's offered is of 128 CPUs\nand 4 TVs of ram now other than the on\ndemand method like a mentioned before\nyou can also use spot instances now\nthese are for situations where your\napplication is more fault tolerant and\ncan handle an interruption now you pay\nfor the spot price which is effective at\na particular hour now these spot prices\ndo fluctuate but are adjusted over a\nperiod of time the largest instance\noffered with Google cloud is 160 CPUs\nand 3.75 TBS R like spot instances of\nAWS Google Cloud offers shortlived\ncompute instances suitable for bad jobs\nand fall tolerant workloads they are\ncalled as preemptable instances so these\ninstances are available at 80% off on on\ndemand price hence they've reduce your\ncompute engine cost significantly and\nunlike AWS these come at a fixed price\nGoogle Cloud platform is a lot more\nflexible when it comes to instance\nconfiguration you simply choose your CPU\nand RAM combination of course you can\neven create your own instance types this\nway before we wrap it up let's compare\non some other things as well Telemetry\nit's a process of automatically\ncollecting periodic measurements from\nremote devices for example GPS g gcp is\nobviously better because they have\nSuperior Telemetry tools which help in\nanalyzing services and providing more\nopportunities for improvement when it\ncomes to application support AWS is\nobviously better since they have years\nof experience under their Bel AWS\nprovides the best support that can be\ngiven to the customers containers are\nbetter with GCB a container is a virtual\nprocess running in user space as\nkubernetes was originally developed by\nGoogle gcp has full native support for\nthe tool other cloud services are just\nfine-tuning a way to provide cuets as a\nservice also the containers help with\nabstracting applications from their\nenvironment they originally running the\napplications can be deployed easily\nregardless of their environment when it\ncomes to geographies AWS is better since\nthey have a head start of a few years\nAWS in this span of time has been able\nto cover a larger market share and\ngeographical locations now it's time for\nthe big decision so who's it going to be\nyeah who is it going to be gcp or AWS I\nthink I'm going to go for choosing the\nright cloud computing platform is the\ndecision that's made on the basis of the\nuser or the organization's requirement\non that note I believe it's time for us\nto wrap this video up we hope you guys\nenjoyed this video and learn something\nnew that AWS is better right no that\nchoosing a platform entirely depends on\nyou and your organization's requirement\nhello everyone welcome to this session\non Google Cloud platform website hosting\nand let's understand what Google Cloud\nplatform offers when it comes to your\nweb hosting\nrequirements here we will learn about\ngohle Cloud web hosting some basics of\ncloud computing web hosting service\nproviders what is gcp and why go for it\ndifferent types of web hosting which are\npossible a use case such as Lush and a\nquick handson on using gcp for web\nhosting when you talk about Cloud web\nhosting Google cloud has the Fe feature\nof hosting a secure and reliable\nwebsites easily it ensures customers and\nsites protection the website is a is\nhosted on a fast and reliable Network\nyou can do more work for Less Price with\nGoogle Cloud now when we talk about\nGoogle Cloud it is always good to know\nsome basics of our cloud computing now\nwhen we talk about cloud computing cloud\ncomputing is basically us using\nresources which are provided by your\ncloud service provider such as Google\ncloud and cloud computing basically\nmeans using hardware and software\ncomponents to deliver a service on a\nnetwork now here users can access files\napplications from any device that can\naccess Internet so when we talk about\ncloud computing this is basically using\nServices which are host Ed on the\ninfrastructure managed by cloud provider\nwhen we talk about resources which can\nbe used that may include big data\nservices storage options your Computing\noptions networking options and various\nother services which a cloud provider\noffers cloud computing has various\ndifferent service models such as you\nhave platform as a service software as a\nservice infrastructure as a service also\nthese days we talk about containers as a\nservice and these are your different\nComputing service models which are being\noffered by cloud service providers which\nallow you for automatic integration with\nyour existing environment or if you\nwould want to benefit from modernization\nby using a cloud providers\ninfrastructure you have different\nServices which are offered some of them\nare for autos software integration or\nmigration backing up and restoring data\nscaling your storage capacity that is\ngoing for an unlimited storage capacity\nand using a resource provided by cloud\nservice provider benefiting from\nreliability cost efficiency which is\noffered by a cloud provider in this case\nwe are talking about Google Cloud when\nyou talk about web hosting service\nproviders there are various web hosting\nservice providers you have AWS you have\nSquarespace IBM Cloud GoDaddy Blu host\nand Google Cloud so what is gcp and why\ngo for\nit when you talk about gcp or as we call\nit as Google Cloud platform it a set of\nCloud Computing Services provided by\nGoogle that runs on the same\ninfrastructure that Google uses for it\nend user products like YouTube Gmail and\nmuch more when you talk about gcp there\nare various reasons why anyone would\nchoose it for their use cases now let's\nlook at some reasons when you talk about\npricing gcp has better pricing compared\nto its competitors depending on the\nservices which you would use whether\nthat would be infrastructure as a\nservice such as using compute engine\ninstances and running your applications\non them or might be a managed service\nsuch as as data proc or big table or\nyour big query where you can have your\nHado clusters running or store huge\namount of data or even build your data\nwarehouse wherein you can store\nstructured data so there are different\nservices with gcp offers and pricing has\nbeen a better option in case of Google\nin comparison to other competitors when\nyou talk about Speed and Performance\nit's very fast and increases the\nperformance of your product project if\nyou use different services offered by\nGoogle when you talk about live\nmigration of apps this is one of the\nfeatures which organizations usually\nlike which none of other competitors are\noffering when it comes to live migration\nof apps so there are specific features\nfor example when you talk about computer\nengine there is a feature stating live\nmigration wherein your resources or your\ninstances which are running app\napplications would be migrated during\nsay maintenance from one underlying host\nto another underlying host without\naffecting your application's performance\nand you can benefit from that when you\ntalk about Big Data Google cloud has\nvarious offerings in Big Data space and\nthat's one of the advantages of gcp in\ncomparison to other competitors you have\ndifferent services for your big data\nneeds such as Pub sub for publish\nsubscri describing messaging system or\ngoing for data proc which basically\nallows you to spin up your Hadoop and\nSpark clusters to run your different\njobs and so on so when we talk about\nfeatures of Google Cloud platform it\noffers High productivity because you are\nusing the resources which are based on\nthe same infrastructure which Google\nuses for its own different use cases you\ncan work from anywhere provided you have\ninternet connection and you can connect\nto to the cloud platform and use\ndifferent services offered via web you\ncan quickly collaborate with different\nteams or different colleagues working on\ndifferent projects which might be\nsharing or using different gcp resources\nyou are benefiting from high security\nand different encryption and security\nmechanisms with gcp offers now there are\nfewer sources or you could say data\nwhich is stored or vulnerable devices\nthere is high reliability flexibility or\nscalability which gcp offers and the\ncost Effectiveness really makes it as a\ngood choice when you would want to\nbenefit from infrastructure\nmodernization and using a cloud platform\nsolution for your use case now when you\ntalk about different types of web\nhosting Google Cloud offers three types\nof web hosting you have WordPress now it\nis a free and open source content\nmanagement system you might have used in\npast or have heard about WordPress where\nlot of websites are being created it is\na popular web publishing platform to\neasily set up blogs and websites and\nthus used by organizations or even\nindividual users for having their blogs\nor running their websites or promoting\ntheir products you have lamp which\nstands for Linux Apache MySQL and PHP\nand lamp stack consists of Linux Apache\nhtd DP server MySQL and PHP and is used\nto host websites and web\napplications you also have your option\nof building your own website so you can\ndevelop website or web application with\nyour own code directly on compute engine\nnow let's look at a use case and\nunderstand what happened here when we\ntalk about Lush so Lush was founded in\n1995 it's you might have seen this brand\nsomewhere in the streets it is a global\nCosmetics retailer headquartered in UK\nit sells a diverse range of fresh\nhandmade products Lush had become a\nglobal brand with over 930 stores in 49\ncountries so the challenges which were\nfaced here was traffic on boxing day\ncaused website crash for almost 18 hours\nand this is something which had a\ndevastating effect on their business the\nprevious platform had no scalability\noption what was the solution the\nmovement of website during the peak time\nwas easy due to flexibility of gcp\nplatform with rapid BM deployment on\nGoogle compute engine the environments\nwere monitored and destroyed in minutes\nso the team could test and deploy at\nspeed by using Google Cloud SQL Lush\ntook complete control of its\ninfrastructure and optimize its systems\nfor Effective scaling overall the\nplatform resulted in lower cost that led\nto a bright future for Lush Cosmetics\nnow what was the result of all this the\navailability during Peak loads was\nimproved because of Google compute\nengines autoscaling feature the\ninfrastructure hosting costs were\nreduced by 40% streamline data center\nusage from 5 to 3 with Google's\nhighquality private Network really\nbenefited Lush and it provided a\nflexible architecture and scalability\nfor future business growth now what we\nhave seen here is that your Google cloud\nand its web hosting basically offers\nusers to run their websites or use a web\nhosting solution that can benefit in\nmore than one way the simplest approach\ncould be seen is by clicking and setting\nup a VM instance by going to your\nconsole for example if we go in to the\nGoogle Cloud platform clicking on\nconsole and here the easiest way I could\ntest it is by going to my compute engine\nVM instances and here I can spin up an\ninstance I can click on create now in my\nprevious sessions I have also explained\nabout how you could create a template\nand run an instance from that we can\nalso click on new VM instance let's call\nit new instance I will choose a region\nfor example Frankfurt I will let it be\ngeneral purpose machine me let this\nmachine be one virtual CPU core and 3.75\nGB Ram if I'm looking for a heavier\nwebsite which might have more users\nlogging in and so on then I can choose a\nhigher configuration machine here we\nhave the option to choose our\ndistribution so for example I can choose\nu 2 and then I can choose a distribution\nversion so let it be\n16.04 we can choose the dis size to be\n20 GB and we can use ssds or hdds so as\nof now it is standard persistent disk\nthat is HDD and that should be enough\nlet's click on select here I will say\nallow default access I would say allow\nHTTP and\nhttps so that if I have a website\ncontent hosted on this machine I can\naccess it over HTTP now here you have\nmanagement options for your instance you\nhave security option which basically\nallows you to provide a public key if\nyou are interested in using an external\nSSH client to connect now I have used\nputy gen and I have already created a\nprivate key which is here I have also\nconverted that as a pem file and anytime\nif I would want to use this key all I\nneed to do is click on puty gen where I\nhad earlier created this PPK file now I\ncan just do a load and I can choose the\nkey which I have here\nand I can give the pass pH click on okay\nand that shows you the public key let's\ncopy the public key from here let's go\ninto our instance and I can give this\nhere that resolves the name so I have\nthe private key saved on my machine and\npublic key which will be pushed into the\nmachine I can click on Create and that\nshould create my instance to which you\ncan connect using SSH from the console\nitself or using a external client such\nas puty which will then need the public\nIP of this instance the PPK file what we\nhave and you can connect to this\ninstance what I can also do is I can\njust do a simple SSH from here and that\nwill basically allow me to connect to\nthe instance what we also need to\nremember is each instance what we create\nin compute is also having some default\nfirewall rules now I have connected to\nmy instance I can click on pseudo SU you\nI can log in as root and here if I would\nwant I can install a particular service\nso let's say Apache uh let's say appt\nget install and then I can say Apache 2\nor\nhttpd that is basically to host your web\napplication so I'm installing the\nservice and here I can check if the\nservice is running by doing a service\nhttpd status or I can say ser service\nApache 2 status which says it is already\nrunning that means the Apache web server\npage will be accessible from HTTP\nprovided my firewall rules allow that\nnow before we look into this we can also\nfor our instance look at the firewall\nrules so here you have Network details\nnow since we created an instance by\ndefault Google has created some firewall\nrules which allow default HTTP\nhttps ICM P your default internal access\nRDP and SSH access and here it says\nthese Ingress rules which allow incoming\ntraffic are allowed from anywhere we can\ncustomize that as specific IP addresses\nwe can also look at ESS which is\nbasically outgoing traffic and this is\nagain saying my machine can connect to\nthe external World in different ways\nusing different protocols so you can\ncustomize these firewall rules as of now\nI'm going to Let It Be default now we\nconnected to our instance from the\nbrowser and we were basically checking\nhow you can use this browser by clicking\non this now what I can also do is here\nI'm logged into the instance my Apache\nserver is running so the best way to\ncheck if the Apache web server is\naccessible via HTTP all I need is my\npublic IP so let's copy this let's go\nhere and I will say\nHTTP SL slash just give your public IP\nand that shows your Apache to web server\npage that means the Apache service has\nalready been run now here it tells if\nyou would want to host a particular page\nwhat you will have to do is as it says\nhere it is based on equivalent page on\ndbn from which ubu Apache packaging is\nderived if you can read this page it\nmeans Apache HTTP server is installed at\nthis site is working properly now you\ncan replace this file located at VAR\nwwwh HTML index.html before continuing\nto operate your HTTP server so this is\nwhere you can change the particular page\nand you will be able to host your\nwebsite on this particular ec2 instance\nwhat we can do is we can check this so\nwe can go into the browser and we can\nlook in VAR www and that has an HTML\nfolder look into this and as of now you\nhave a\nindex.html and that basically is the\npage what we are seeing now I can click\non this one and I can see I have a small\nHTML page which is basically showing me\nwhat we are seeing on our web server\nwhat I can also do is for now I can test\nit out and I can put in a different HTML\npage and see how that works so we had\nbasically the page here in VAR\nwww and then we had the HTML folder and\nin HTML folder what I had was this index\nfile so as of now I just moved it and I\nput it in a different location so if I\nlook in my home\nhdu index.html\nthat shows me the complete HTML page\nwhat we were seeing on our web server\nand here it shows you what this page\nwould display if you run it on your HTTP\nit says Apache to window default page it\nshows it works it shows the content and\nso on so for just testing I mve this\npage out from this location and what I\ndid was I added a different page here so\nthat page if if you look in HTML and\nthen look in my page. HTML section I've\njust added some basic details of\ncreating HTML I'm saying body I'm using\nMari and then I'm closing this with HTML\ntag now this is a simple HTML page which\nI created and now what I did was once\nI've done this I basically did a service\nApache restart so once you do that it\nwill take up your new page and once you\nhave done that now you can access that\nby going to your\nHTTP giv your details and then basically\ngive your public IP which we can get\nfrom\nhere and just paste it here now hit on\nthis so that shows me there is a my\npage. HTML I can click on this and that\nbasically shows the symbol page which I\ncreated so as of now this is my web page\nwhich I have created created and this is\nhosted on my compute instance now\nobviously we can create a more complex\nwebsite backed up by a database use PHP\nuse MySQL to store the data and then\nhost your website on a Google Cloud\nplatform service such as compute where\nyour actual code is running so we can\nlearn about your web hosting on\ncomputing instances in further\nsessions are you in the analytic space\nHave you ever wondered how data\nprocessing in
