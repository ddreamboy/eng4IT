  "text": "hello everyone welcome to this tutorial\nby simply learn in this video you will\nlearn about an interesting machine\nlearning topic that is supervised versus\nunsupervised versus reinforcement\nlearning let's discuss each of them in\ndetail and understand when to use these\nalgorithms along with their applications\nnow there are a number of algorithms\nused in the field of machine learning to\nsolve complex problems\neach of these algorithms can be\nclassified into a certain category so\nthe different types of machine learning\nalgorithms are supervised learning\nunsupervised learning and reinforcement\nlearning now let's look at the\ndefinition of each of these learning\ntechniques supervised learning uses\nlabeled data to train machine learning\nmodels label data means that the output\nis already known to you the model just\nneeds to map the inputs to the outputs\nan example of supervised learning can be\nto train a machine that identifies the\nimage of an animal below you can see we\nhave a trained model that identifies the\npicture of a cat unsupervised learning\nuses unlabelled data to train machines\nunlabeled data means there is no fixed\noutput variable the model learns from\nthe data discovers patterns and features\nin the data and Returns the output here\nis an example of an unsupervised\nlearning technique that uses the images\nof vehicles to classify if it's a bus or\na truck so the model learns by\nidentifying the paths of a vehicle such\nas the length and width of the vehicle\nthe front and rear end covers roof hoods\nthe types of Wheels used Etc based on\nthese features the model classifies if\nthe vehicle is a bus or a\ntruck reinforcement learning trains a\nmachine to take suitable actions and\nmaximize reward in a particular\nsituation it uses an agent and an\nenvironment to produce actions and\nrewards the agent has a start and an end\nstate but there might be different parts\nfor reaching the end State like a maze\nin this learning technique there is no\npredefined target variable an example of\nreinforcement learning is to train a\nmachine that can identify the shape of\nan object given a list of different\nobjects such as square triangle\nrectangle or a circle in the example\nshown the model tries to predict the\nshape of the object which is a square\nhere now let's look at the different\nmachine learning algorithms that come\nunder these learning techniques some of\nthe commonly used supervised learning\nalgorithms are linear regression\nlogistic regression support Vector\nmachines K nearest neighbors decision\ntree random forest and knife\nbase examples of unsupervised learning\nalgorithms are K means clustering\nhierarchical clustering DB scan\nprincipal component analysis and others\nchoosing the right algorithm depends on\nthe type of problem you're trying to\nsolve some of the important\nreinforcement learning algorithms are\nare Q learning Monte Carlo sarsa and\ndeep Q Network now let's look at the\napproach in which these machine learning\ntechniques\nwork so supervised learning takes\nlabeled inputs and Maps it to known\noutputs which means you already know the\ntarget\nvariable unsupervised learning finds\npatterns and understands the trends in\nthe data to discover the output so the\nmodel tries to label the data based on\nthe features of the input\ndata while reinforcement learning\nfollows trial and error method to get\nthe desired solution after accomplishing\na task the agent receives an award an\nexample could be to train a dog to catch\nthe ball if the dog learns to catch a\nball you give it a reward such as a\nbiscuit now let's discuss the training\nprocess for each of these learning\nmethods so supervised learning methods\nneed external supervision to train\nmachine learning models and hence the\nname supervised they need guidance and\nadditional information to return the\nresult unsupervised learning techniques\ndo not need any supervision to train\nmodels they learn on their own and\npredict the output similarly\nreinforcement learning methods do not\nneed any supervision to train machine\nlearning models and with that let's\nfocus on the types of problems that can\nbe solved using these three types of\nmachine learning techniques so\nsupervised learning is generally used\nfor classification and regression\nproblems we'll see the examples in the\nnext SL\nslide and unsupervised learning is used\nfor clustering and Association problems\nwhile reinforcement learning is reward\nbased so for every task or for every\nstep completed there will be a reward\nreceived by the agent and if the task is\nnot achieved correctly there will be\nsome penalty\nused now let's look at a few\napplications of supervised unsupervised\nand reinforcement\nlearning as we saw earlier supervised\nlearning learning are used to solve\nclassification and regression problems\nfor example You can predict the weather\nfor a particular day based on humidity\nprecipitation wind speed and pressure\nvalues you can use supervised learning\nalgorithms to forecast sales for the\nnext month or the next quarter for\ndifferent products similarly you can use\nit for stock price analysis or\nidentifying if a cancer cell is\nmalignant or\nbenign now talking about the\napplications of unsupervised learning we\nhave customer segmentation so based on\ncustomer Behavior likes dislikes and\ninterests you can segment and cluster\nsimilar customers into a group another\nexample where unsupervised learning\nalgorithms are used as customer churn\nanalysis now let's see what applications\nwe have in reinforcement learning so\nreinforcement learning algorithms are\nwidely used in the gaming Industries to\nbuild games it is also used to train\nrobots to perform human\ntasks and with that we have come to the\nend of this video on supervised vers\nvers
