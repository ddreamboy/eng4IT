  "text": "imagine you're the owner of a small\nsoftware development firm and you want\nto scale your business up\nhowever a small team size the\nunpredictability of demand and limited\nresources are roadblocks for this\nexpansion\nthat's when you hear about cloud\ncomputing but before investing money\ninto it you decide to draw up the\ndifferences between on-premise and\ncloud-based computing to make a better\ndecision\nwhen it comes to scalability you pay\nmore for an on-premise setup and get\nlesser options too\nonce you've scaled up it is difficult to\nscale down\nand often leads to heavy losses in terms\nof infrastructure and maintenance costs\ncloud computing on the other hand allows\nyou to pay only for how much you use\nwith much easier and faster provisions\nfor scaling up or down\nnext let's talk about server storage\non-premise systems need a lot of space\nfor their servers notwithstanding the\npower and maintenance hassles that come\nwith them on the other hand cloud\ncomputing solutions are offered by cloud\nservice providers who manage and\nmaintain the servers saving you both\nmoney and space\nthen we have data security on-premise\nsystems offer less data security\nthanks to a complicated combination of\nphysical and traditional i.t security\nmeasures whereas cloud computing systems\noffer much better security and lets you\navoid having to constantly monitor and\nmanage security protocols in the event\nthat a data loss does occur the chance\nfor data recovery with on-premise setups\nare very small\nin contrast cloud computing systems have\nrobust disaster recovery measures in\nplace to ensure faster and easier data\nrecovery\nfinally we have maintenance\non-premises systems also require\nadditional teams for hardware and\nsoftware maintenance loading up the\ncosts by a considerable degree\ncloud computing systems on the other\nhand are maintained by the cloud service\nproviders reducing your costs and\nresource allocation substantially\nso now thinking that cloud computing is\na better option you decide to take a\ncloser look at what exactly cloud\ncomputing is\ncloud computing refers to the delivery\nof on-demand computing services over the\ninternet on a pay-as-you-go basis\nin simpler words rather than managing\nfiles and services on a local storage\ndevice you'll be doing the same over the\ninternet in a cost efficient manner\ncloud computing has two types of models\ndeployment model and service model\nthere are three types of deployment\nmodels public private and hybrid cloud\nimagine you're traveling to work you've\ngot three options to choose from\none you have buses which represent\npublic clouds in this case the cloud\ninfrastructure is available to the\npublic over the internet\nthese are owned by cloud service\nproviders\ntwo then you have the option of using\nyour own car\nthis represents the private cloud with\nthe private cloud the cloud\ninfrastructure is exclusively operated\nby a single organization this can be\nmanaged by the organization or a third\nparty and finally you have the option to\nhail a cab\nthis represents the hybrid cloud\na hybrid cloud is a combination of the\nfunctionalities of both public and\nprivate clouds\nnext let's have a look at the service\nmodels there are three major service\nmodels available es pass and sas\ncompared to on-premise models where\nyou'll need to manage and maintain every\ncomponent including applications data\nvirtualization and middleware cloud\ncomputing service models are hassle-free\nis refers to infrastructure as a service\nit is a cloud service model where users\nget access to basic computing\ninfrastructure they are commonly used by\nit administrators\nif your organization requires resources\nlike storage or virtual machines is is\nthe model for you you only have to\nmanage the data runtime middleware\napplications and the os while the rest\nis handled by the cloud providers\nnext we have pass\npass or platform as a service provides\ncloud platforms and runtime environments\nfor developing testing and managing\napplications\nthis service model enables users to\ndeploy applications without the need to\nacquire manage and maintain the related\narchitecture\nif your organization is in need of a\nplatform for creating software\napplications pass is the model for you\npass only requires you to handle the\napplications and the data the rest of\nthe components like runtime middleware\noperating systems servers storage and\nothers are handled by the cloud service\nproviders\nand finally we have sas\nsas or software as a service involves\ncloud services for hosting and managing\nyour software applications\nsoftware and hardware requirements are\nsatisfied by the vendors so you don't\nhave to manage any of those aspects of\nthe solution\nif you'd rather not worry about the\nhassles of owning any it equipment the\nsas model would be the one to go with\nwith sas the cloud service provider\nhandles all components of the solution\nrequired by the organization\ntime for a quiz now in which of the\nfollowing deployment models are you as\nthe business responsible for the\napplication data and operating system\none is\ntwo\npass\nthree\nsas\nfour is and pass\nlet us know your answer in the comments\nsection below for a chance to win an\namazon voucher\ncoming back to cloud computing some of\nthe most popular cloud computing\nservices in the market are aws or amazon\nweb services microsoft azure and google\ncloud platform\nwant to learn more about them and how\nthey differ from each other\nclick on the top right corner for an\nanalysis of how these service platforms\nare different from each other\nand on that note we have come to the end\nof this video we hope you found this\ninformative and helpful if you enjoyed\nthis video a thumbs up would be really\nappreciated\ndon't forget to subscribe to the simply\nlearn channel and hit the bell icon
