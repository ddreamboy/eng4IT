use excel\npower query moving ahead you will learn\nthe basics of power bi and use power bi\nfor creating reports\nfinally you will understand tableau from\nscratch\nyou look at the different features of\ntableau and how to create different\ncharts and graphs to analyze and\nvisualize data and tableau\nover to shruti now\nbefore i start off with our top 5 bi\ntools i'd like to talk a bit about\nbusiness intelligence\nas you might be aware there are zillions\nof companies across the world these\ncompanies generate massive amounts of\ndata on a daily basis when i say data\nhere it simply refers to business\ninformation both internal and external\ncustomer feedback product innovations\nand profit loss reports to name a few\ncompanies use all of this information to\nmake crucial decisions that can either\nhamper or boost their business\nyou might have heard of the term data as\nthe new oil well it definitely is if\norganizations analyze all the available\ndata very well then this oil is\ndefinitely valuable\nand to help organizations with this we\nhave business intelligence which is more\noften termed as bi\nwe can define bi as a technology driven\nprocess which works on analyzing\nunstructured data to derive meaningful\ninformation from it basically it is a\nset of architecture and processes that\nconvert raw data into useful information\nthat helps in achieving profit for a\nbusiness\nso to achieve business intelligence\ngoals we use a set of tools these tools\nare termed as bi tools they help\norganizations acquire and analyze data\nefficiently\nsome of the bi tools are seasonal but\nsome are evergreen we have a plethora of\nthese tools in the market which makes it\nhard for businesses to select one single\ntool\nhere we have a recommendation list

functions and\nformulas we will learn about conditional\nformatting data validation pivot chart\nand pivot table\nnow let's look at a scenario here so one\nday in a startup\none professional speaks that their\nbusiness is growing and they would need\nan efficient way to work with the data\nthey would have to find a way to work\nfaster with storing and analyzing data\nnow to that another colleague responds\nwell we can make use of microsoft excel\nto do this job\nthe question is will excel be able to\ncater to\ntheir business needs\nnow\nthe colleague responds well we can make\nuse of excel in several ways and it also\nis a cost efficient\noption\nnow in that case the colleague who posed\nthe question\nsays let's go ahead with excellent let's\ntrain our employees in excel\nand\nthe suggestion is welcomed which would\nmake the job easier for them\nand they would basically\ndecide on using excel so they decide on\ntaking a training right away and\nbasically starting to learn excel\nnow\nbefore we move to excel one of the\nquestion is why should we use excel\nso let's look at some of the points here\nso excel proves to be a great platform\nto perform various mathematical\ncalculation on large data sets which is\none of the biggest requirements of\nvarious organizations these days\nvarious features in excel like searching\nsorting filtering makes it easier for\nyou to play with the data\nand excel also allows you to beautify\nyour data and present it\nin the form of charts tables and data\nbars\nnow when it comes to reporting reporting\naccounting and analysis can be performed\nwith the help of excel\nit can help you with your task lists\nyour calendars and goal planning\nworksheets\nexcel also provides good security for\nyour data excel files have the feature\nof password protection\nthis way your information can be safe\nnow when we talk about what is excel and\nhow it can be used\nso excel or you might have heard a\nspreadsheet can be basically used for\na lot of different tasks than just\nstoring the information in so called\ntabular format\nnow microsoft excel is an application\nthat is used for recording analyzing and\nvisualizing data it is in the form of a\nspreadsheet\nlet's have a look at few of the\nfunctions and formulas used in excel and\nbefore we do that we can also quickly\ntake a\nsmall tour to understand how to work\nwith excel now to do that what we can do\nis we can\ntype in in our search say for example\nexcel and just select your excel app\nwhich is installed and here you see you\nhave a lot of options which says take a\ntour drop down list get started with\nformulas make your pivot table\ngoing forward with pie charts and much\nmore so we can click on this one which\nsays take a tour\nand that basically pops up a window\nwhich says welcome to excel and\nif you have always wanted to be better\nat excel\nyou have this\nwhich can help you so let's click on\ncreate and that takes us to the store\nwindow now that says instructions for\nscreen readers which basically talks\nabout 10 different steps in which we can\nlearn excel\nand using the spreadsheet app\nso there are more than 11 sheets\nwhich we see here at the bottom end and\neach one gives us a simple example which\nwe can work on so for example if i click\non add\nnow that takes me to this page which\nsays how do we add numbers now you might\nbe provided data which we can\nupload by loading a file from our\nmachine or getting data from a web\nsource or even connecting to a database\nso there are various options which we\nwill see in some time so here we have an\noption which is called data you can\nclick on this one and this basically has\noptions where you can use existing\nconnections if you have created some you\ncan always click on from other sources\nand you can get your data from sql\nserver from analysis services\nfrom odata data feed you can get in from\nxml from data connection wizard or also\nfrom microsoft query you can be running\nin different queries here which shows up\nin the option which says new query there\nare connections which you can use\nand that basically will display all the\nconnections\nfor this particular workbook which we\ndid not have as of now but we can create\nthem but let's look at simple examples\nnow you can follow these instructions\nhere which says basically\nadding up the numbers and that could be\neasily done by just placing your cursor\nhere\nand what you could do is either you can\ntype in the formula that is from which\nrow to which row you would want to add\nthe data so for example i could just do\na sum here and that shows up all the\ndifferent functions which are available\nthen we can open up a parenthesis and we\ncan say\ni would be interested in totaling the\namount\nfrom\ncolumn d and i would select for example\nd4\nso\ni could be doing this and then i could\nsay d4\nonwards till d7 so that's the data which\ni'm interested in you can close your\nparenthesis and hit enter and that gives\nyou the total\nthere is also a shortcut for this which\nyou can always do is we can first delete\nthis and you can just place your cursor\nhere and just\nuse your alt and equals that\nautomatically selects the numericals\nwhich we can anytime\nexpand or basically collapse so i will\nbasically select this which says this\nfunction needs two numbers which is\nnumber one and number two and then you\ncan hit on enter and that gives you the\ntotal\nso similarly we can be getting in the\ndata\nhere by selecting all the fields\nso here it also says that you can use a\nshortcut now what we can also do is we\ncan add numbers over 50\nby selecting the yellow cell here and\nthen giving a condition\nsuch as so i can basically use something\nlike sum if\nand then open a parenthesis i can select\ni would be interested in this row and\nthen i can even drag and drop\ntill here so that tells me d11 to d15\nyou can then put in a comma here and you\ncan give your condition say for example\nwe would say i would be interested in\nnumbers only above 50\nand we can select this\nclose your quotes and then just close\nyour parenthesis and that's your formula\nso you can do this and that basically\ngives me the total is 100 now similarly\nwe could do that for the amount here i\ncould select this now there is also an\noption i can click on home and i can go\nfor something like auto sum so that's\none more way of doing it which anyway\nsays sum is alt plus equals so it\nautomatically adds up your values and i\ncan try doing a auto sum that\nautomatically selects my rows and then i\ncan get my total now as per this\nactivity here it says try adding another\nsum if formula here but add amounts that\nare less than 100 and the result should\nbe 160. so what we can do is we can\nbasically select all the numbers which\nare lesser than 100 so the way we did\nearlier here\nthere can be always a shortcut so you\ncan always for example if you would want\nto avoid typing in the formula you can\nalways copy it from here\nand then\njust hit on enter so you are back into\nthis cell and then i can basically go\nhere and paste\nthe number and then as per the\nrequirement we are\nrequired to select anything which is\nlesser than 100 so what i could do is i\ncould select here i could say let's say\ng\nand then i can change this value to g15\nand that's one more way now we see our\nselected rows have been changed so i can\nhit on enter and i can check what is the\nresult so we would be interested in\nlooking for numbers which are lesser\nthan 100 so i will have to also change\nthis one to\na lesser sign and that basically gives\nme the total which is 160\nso that's how you can simply add numbers\nyou can use autosum you can type in the\nformula you can select the fields\nor you can just place your cursor where\nyou would be looking for a sum and then\nyou can just do a alt equals and that\nbasically\npopulates the sum\nnow let's look at\nsome easy options of filling your cells\nor automatically populating the values\nin your\ncells within your excel sheet\nnow here we have an option which says\n100 now we can click on this and that\nbasically says it is making a sum of\ncolumn c4 to d4 so if i click on this\none i can check that this is row number\n4\nwhich shows up here and i also know this\nis column c i also have d so this equals\nis basically giving me a sum of c4 to d4\nnow what we can do is we can always\nplace our cursor here at the right\ncorner and then we can just drag and\ndrop and this basically gives me a total\nof all the numbers for all different\nrows\nso this is one shortcut which we can do\nto get the total excel will\nautomatically give the totals which we\ncall as filling down\nnow what we can do is in the same way if\nwe would want to get the totals here we\ncan first check what is this 200 and\nthis tells me it is c11 to c14 total\nso it is totaling the rows from c11 so\ncolumn c and 11th row till 14th row and\nthat's the sum now what i can also do is\ni can similarly like above we can do a\nfilling right which basically means\nbringing your cursor here and then just\ndragging and dropping it all the way\nwhere you would need the totals and this\nbasically gives me the total there is\none more quick way to check if this is\nright\nso the easiest option would be to select\nthis cell now\nwhat i can also do is i can just select\nall of these fields by just highlighting\nand selecting all the fields once it is\nselected\npress on control r and that gives you\nthe total now if we would be doing this\ntop down then i could select all these\nrows\nfor this particular column and then i\ncould do a ctrl d so that's your\nfilling down and this one was filling\nright so this is an easier option of\ndoing a fill\nwhen you would want to have the formula\napplied to every row as it occurs in the\nfirst row or the last row we could test\nthis by for example selecting these\nfields i could delete them and i have\nhere which says 130 i could just place\nmy cursor here and i could drag it all\nthe way up and that should also do the\nsame magic which we were seeing from top\ndown so this is a simple way wherein you\ncan fill up your cells and you can also\nautomatically\npropagate\nor move your computation to all the\ncells\nlet's\nlook at the split option which basically\nhelps us in splitting the data when we\nhave some kind of pattern or when we\nhave some kind of delimiters in our data\nin say one particular column and we\nwould want to derive the values out of\nit so we can always use the splitting\noption now the easiest option would be\nso for example we have our email column\nwhich has the email ids and which we can\nclearly see has a first name dot last\nname now i see that there is a last name\nsmith filled up here first name is empty\nso what i can also do is i can just type\nin say\nnancy here\nnow that's the first name i can again\nstart typing the second name and as soon\nas you do that you would see a faded\nlist of numbers and that's your clue to\nhit enter and once you do that you would\nsee all the first names have been filled\nin here if you would want to maintain\nthe case sensitiveness you can just go\nahead and delete these and let's type in\nas it occurs so let's say nancy as the\nfirst name go down to the next cell and\njust type in andy and there is your\ngrade list so just hit on enter and that\nbasically fills up your first name\nwhat we can also do is\nwe can just select this particular field\nand either we can type in control e\nwhich basically fills up all the options\nnow i can just do a undo by typing in or\nclicking control z\nand that's basically gone\nwhat i can also do is i can select a\nparticular field and then i can go into\nhome option and under home\nyou should have an option here which\nsays fill so you can select this and\nthen you can do a flash fill which is\nwhat we are doing here so click on flash\nfill and that automatically fills up the\nvalues so in this way you can work\nwithin your spreadsheet and you can be\nfilling up the values where a delimiter\nby default is understood and we can\nsplit the data now however sometimes you\nmight have some data which has a\ndifferent kind of delimiter and there is\nagain a smarter way of splitting your\ndata\nso you can always scroll down here and\nthat says splitting a column based on\ndelimiters so we have some values in the\ndata column and\nthese values in each row are separated\nby comma so\nselect this\nyour data is already selected text to\ncolumns delimited\ncomma is selected\nand now click on next so it basically\nsays\nwhat is the destination let's select\nthis one\nand i can choose\nwhat would you want to have so that\nshows me this would be my data preview\nnow i can basically select this one\ni can say finish\nand say okay\nand now if you see our data has been\nplaced in in the columns appropriately\nso this is how you can split your data\nbased on a delimiter and then organize\nyour data in a better way now there are\nsome advanced options which we can learn\nlater but this basically tells about\nusing a formula so this is something if\nsay if we have some name in one cell and\nif you would want to split it into first\nname\nyour helper column\nyour middle name last name so that can\nalso be done using formulas and this\nbasically tells how would you extract\ncharacters from your left\ncell and how would you place them in\nyour right cell so you can try this\nactivity which is a little more of\nadvanced option the benefit is that\nyou can always use this\nwherein if you\ndo some kind of transformation using\nyour formulas if your original data gets\nupdated then the split data will also\nget updated and that's the benefit of\nusing formulas where you can place\nvalues from one cell into multiple cells\nbased on execution of your details in\nthe formulas\nhow about using the transpose option now\nyou might have heard of situations where\nyou would want to\nswitch or turn your rows into columns\nand your columns into rows and that's\nwhere transposing comes into picture it\nmight be useful when you have your data\nin your x and y axis or as i would say\nin rows and columns and you would want\nto switch your rows to become the\ncolumns and columns to become\nyour rows so what we can do is the\nsimplest way is you can\nselect all your\nvalues so here we basically have six\ncolumns and i would say two rows now i\ncan select all of these and then i can\nselect an empty field for example the\none which is highlighted here well you\ncan always do a control alt v that's a\nshortcut what you can also do is\nonce you have selected all your fields\nyou can just copy them so just do a ctrl\nc\nand then click on an empty cell\nand then what you can do is you can do a\nspecial paste or paste special so under\nyour home you have the paste option and\nhere you can go for paste special and\nonce you do that you need to select the\ntranspose option over here and click on\nok\nand now you will see that the columns\nand the rows have been transposed so\nyour row name was item and that has\nbecome the column heading you had row\nname as amount and that has become the\ncolumn heading and all your values have\nbeen transposed\nin\nthis particular format now there is\nanother way of doing that and again\nthat's using your formulas so what you\ncan do is you can transpose with a\nformula also and that basically\nworks\nwhen you have similar kind of data so\nthis has six columns\nand basically two rows so you can\nbasically do this so you can select this\nand earlier we were doing a copy but now\nwhat we would want to do is we would\nwant to just look at the row numbers\nwhich tells me it is c 33 c 34\nand it starts with c and ends\nin with your h column so what we can do\nis we know that we have six columns and\ntwo rows so transposing that would\nactually give me two columns and six\nrows so what we can do is we can select\ntwo columns\nand six rows in our excel sheet i can\nthen basically start typing in the\nmessage or i can just go to the address\nbar and here\ni can say\ntranspose\nlet's go for c33 h34 it basically\nselects my data\nand now i can just do a control shift\nand enter and now if you see all the\nvalues have been populated now you can\njust place your cursor in one of the\ncells but if you see the address bar the\nformula remains the same this is because\nthis is an array formula so we can read\nmore about an array formula here it's\nbasically something which performs\ncalculations and on more than one cell\nin an array\nand in the example here the array is the\noriginal data that is c33 to h34 so your\ntranspose is just changing\nthe horizontal orientation to the\nvertical orientation so this is a very\nsimple way in which you can basically\nuse the\nexcel's capability to transpose your\ndata and convert your rows into columns\nand columns into rows apart from\nworking on\nadditions subtractions filling up your\ndata\nsorting\nthe data or basically splitting your\ndata\ntransposing your data one of the other\nrequirements is sorting and filtering\nyour data now that can be very handy\nwhen you're working on huge data and you\nwould want to sort it in a particular\norder say ascending or descending or\nmight be based on a particular field or\nif that field was or if the cell was\nhighlighted with a particular color\nsorting the data so let's look at how\nexcel can be used for sorting and\nfiltering examples are pretty simple\nhere so\nlet's check that so if we're going to\nsort and filter and say this is the data\ni have say for example i would want to\nsort the values in the department column\nalphabetically so what i can do is i can\nselect department column and i'm already\nin the home tab i can straight away go\nhere which says sort and filter i can\nthen say sort a to z and that's\nbasically alphabetically sorting your\ndepartment column\nand once once i do this you would see\nthe data has been sorted but it's not\njust this data we can just do a ctrl z\nand check what are the values we have so\nhere we have meat which is beef and 90\nten thousand the values then you have\nbakery which should ideally be the first\nrow if we sort it in alphabetical order\nwhich goes with bakery as desserts you\nhave the values so we can check this\nagain so select department and then just\ndo a sort and filter and let's say sort\na to z\nand if you see the data has changed but\nit's not just in changing your first\ncolumn but then it has taken care of all\nthe data however the data has been\nsorted based on the department column so\nyou have bakery which aligns with\ndeserts which has the values and now we\nhave all the data which has been\nfiltered now what we can also do is we\ncan sort december's amounts from largest\nto smallest so what we can do is we can\nbasically click any cell in the december\ncolumn let's say 20 000\nand then what i can do is i can go into\nsort\nfilter and then i can say sort largest\nto smallest so if you see bakery breads\nis the row which has the smallest data\nor maybe you have delhi sandwiches\nso that one looks also smaller so let's\ndo a\nlarger to smallest and if i do this you\nwould see the values have been shifted\nnow so it is no more based on the\ndepartment column\nbecause now the data is being sorted\nbased on the values in the december\ncolumn and you see bakery which was\nalphabetically the first one has become\nsecond last\nso either you can sort the data based on\na department column which goes\nbased on the values these are all string\nvalues or words so it sorts\nalphabetically if you have numbers might\nbe you can give some values and you can\nsort the data\nyou could anytime do a custom sort and\nyou could basically select\nif you would want to select the data so\ni could do a custom sort and then i\ncould choose\nwhich is the column which we would want\nto use for sorting what is the sorting\nneeds to be done\nis it cell values is its cell color font\ncolor conditional formatting and then\nyou can also choose the order so that's\none more way to do that\nnow if you scroll down that also shows\nhow you can sort by date or a color so\nfor example if you would want to sort\nbased on the expense date so there are\ndifferent options so what i can do is i\ncan select this date field i can just do\na right click i can go into sort and\nthen i can choose i would want to sort\noldest to newest so since i selected the\ndate field it basically has sorted all\nthe data\nand it has taken the expense date into\nconsideration now there are these\nfilters which you see on the row\nheadings we could have also used those\nso i could have selected this and that\nbasically says or mentions which are the\ndates i would be interested in looking\nat\ni also have sort by color here i can do\na sort oldest to newest or newest to\noldest so i could also use these filters\nwhich have been applied here now we have\nthe data which is in color so if i would\nwant to basically select\nthe color columns or color cells i could\nselect this i can basically do a right\nclick here and when i go into sort i\ncould choose\nput selected color or cell color on the\ntop\nand that basically will make sure that\nmy data is sorted and it has also sorted\nthat in a descending order so in this\nway you can sort or basically filter\nyour data what we can also do is we can\nadd filters so sometimes we can go for\nformulas which we would want to use what\nwe can also do is we can\nbasically select the filter which has\nbeen applied here now how does the\nfilter come in there so if i would\nselect a particular row i could select a\nparticular row and then i could decide\nif i would want to just add a filter to\nthis one and that's how the filter has\ncome in so we have the filter what we\ncan do is we can basically click on this\ndrop down\nand then you have something like number\nfilters so we can always go here\nwe can basically choose one of these so\nwe can basically choose above average so\ni could select this and then basically\nit shows me the values we could also\ndelete the filter by clicking on this\none and we could say well i'm not\ninterested in this filter anymore so i\ncould clear the filter and that shows me\nall the values\nor i could say\nthat let's click on some other field for\nexample food i can go in here i can go\ninto number filters and then i could say\nwell i'm interested in\nvalues which are below average above\naverage might be greater than and then i\ncan choose what is the value so for\nexample if we say i'm interested in food\nwhich is\ngreater than 25 dollars i could give a\nvalue here i could say okay and now i\nhave applied the filter similarly you\ncan select this and then you can just\nclear your filter and your data is back\nso remember no data is lost\nit is just hidden or basically based on\nthe filter not shown\nso that's good enough for us and in this\nway you can sort and filter the data so\nfor more details obviously in all the\nsheets you have the links which point to\nmore information on the web and you can\nalways refer to these so this is simple\nway in which you can sort and filter any\namount of data which has been stored\nwithin your excel within a particular\nsheet now that we have learned about add\nfill split transpose sorting and\nfiltering it will also be good to learn\nhow to work with tables or basically\nconverting your data into a tabular\nformat and then doing some easy\ncomputations so click on this tables\noption here now here we see there is\nsome data which is in\nfive columns and n number of rows so i\ncan basically select this data and then\nwhat i can do is i can\ninsert\nchoose the table option\nand then it says my table as headers and\nwe'll be okay with that i'll say okay\nand now if you see this is the table\ncreated it basically has different\nfilters which we have learnt earlier how\nto use and this is basically my table\nwhich is a collection of cells which has\nsome special features so we can easily\nadd rows to this table we can add\ncolumns to this table and we can even do\nsome calculations so for example here i\ncan click on this one i can\nbasically enter\nsome field\nand then i can hit on enter and we see\nthat this row has been inserted wherein\nwe can easily fill in values for example\ni would say chocolates\ni could give some value here size 25 000\nmight be 35 000\nand then\nbasically i can given some values here\nnow what you can also do is you can\ncontinue adding rows in this way\nand say for example you would want more\ncolumns so you can select this\noption here in the top bottom right\ncorner you can just drag it towards the\nright and that basically has\nautomatically created\ncolumns for my next month\nwherein i can feed in the data so this\nis a simpler way wherein you can keep\nadding more rows and columns to your\ndata if that has been converted in a\ntabular format now let me just do a ctrl\nz that basically deletes the columns\nagain ctrl z deletes the last row which\nwe added and i can stop here or i can\neven remove my values by doing multiple\ncontrol z and removing my rows so this\nis how i converted my data into a table\nand then i can easily work on this what\ni can also do is i can do some\ncalculations so what we can do\nwe have a table here we have a total\nfield and what we can do is we can just\nselect one cell here now as we have\nlearned earlier we can do a alt and then\nequals\nand that basically says what\nis this doing so it says it is\ncalculating the sum of\nthe last three months and if that's what\nyou would want to do just hit on enter\nand it has automatically calculated\nthe totals for\nall your rows for these three columns\nso the sum formula is getting filled up\nnow i can select any particular cell and\ni can look in my address bar so it has\nalready given me the formula\nwhere it has started\ncalculating the sum from the october\ncolumn till the december column and has\ngiven me the calculated values of the\ncolumns what we can also do is we can\nget total rows in the table\nnow that's a simpler option so what we\ncan do is we can select any cell in this\nparticular table\nand then\nwe see that there is a table tools\ndesign option showing up here now i can\nselect this and then it says\nwell let's get a total row so let's\nselect this and it automatically\npopulates the total here\nand if you would want the average then\nwe could select this and from the drop\ndown i can select what i'm interested in\nso for example i would want the average\nvalues and not the total i could just\nselect this and that gives me the\naverage of these values\nso we can always do simpler computations\nhere\nby converting our data into table format\nlet's learn about one more efficient way\nof working with the data and that's\nusing your drop downs so let's see how\ndrop downs work here\nnow\nsay for example you have this data which\nhas the values in the food column and\ndepartment is empty and say for example\nyou would want to\nenter the values in department however\nyou would want to select\nthe department should either have\nproduce or meat and bakery and these are\nthe only three options which should be\navailable for any user to fill in the\nvalues how do we do that so we can\nbasically create a table by\npressing ctrl d so what i can do is\nunder my department\nhere i can select one of the cells\nand then i can do a control t that\nbasically converts this into a table i\ncan say okay and my table is created now\nwhat i can do is once this part is done\nwe can\nselect all the blank fields here where\nwe would want this drop down to be\napplicable\nnow under your data tab you can go in\nand select data validation\nand this has an option called data\nvalidation click on this\nwhich basically says allow any value so\nhere i will select i would want to give\na list of values and then i can type in\nmy values here which i can say produce\nsay for example meat and then say\nbakery now these are the values\nso we can click on ok\nand once we have done that we basically\nhave a drop down here next to apples\nwhich will only show us the values which\nwe can feed in under the department\ncolumn so i can go into every cell and\nthen i can basically choose\nwhat is the department which handles\nthis and then basically i can select one\nof these from the drop down so this is\nan easier option of creating your drop\ndown and then feeding in the values from\nthe set of values which you have defined\nhere on the right\nso this is a simple example of using\nyour drop downs\nworking with your tables working with\nyour sort and filter transpose split\nfilling up your data adding in some data\nhere and similarly you can use excel for\nmore than\none use case using its inbuilt features\nto easily work with your data\nlet's see how we can import data or\nbring in data into our excel from\nyour local machine or from an external\nweb source\nso what we can do is we can open up a\nblank excel sheet and say for example\nyou have been provided a text file or a\ncsv file and you would want to import\nthat data into your excel sheet that can\nbe easily done so right now i've opened\nan\nexcel sheet now i can click on data and\nhere i have an option which says\nexisting connections from other data\nsources\nso or you can click on connections if\nyou have already created some so we can\nclick on from other sources\nso this is one option where you can\nconnect to your different data sources\nand you can get the data\nfrom\none of these what we can also do is i\ncan click on connections now it says\nthere is none i can click on add it says\nwell show the connections where\nconnection files on network\nconnection files on this computer so i\ncan say let's get some files from this\ncomputer\nnow if that does not show up something\nso say browse for more and that\nbasically shows you different options so\nlet's basically select a folder where i\nhave\nsome data sets i'll click in here\nand this is basically a folder where i\nhave some data sets now let me select\nthis particular file and i know it is a\ncsv file\nso let's click on\nopen now if you would want to verify\nthis you could have gone and looked into\nthe properties of the file and it says\nit is a dot csv file which is what we\nare interested in so i'll take this file\ni'll say open now this basically shows\nme\nthe text import wizard option which says\nis the file delimited i'll say yes\nclick on next so i will select comma as\nmy delimiter i can say text qualifier is\nnone\nnow this is my data so my data preview\nis already showing me the data is\nwhat is the data in the csv file you can\nclick on next and then you have an\noption which says data format is general\nyou can go for date format you can go\nfor advanced options so i'll just say\nfinish\nand basically now this has been created\nhere\nso we basically have this and now i can\nclick on\nclose now once you have done that you\ncan click on existing connections it\nshows me the data\nwhich we have here the connection which\nwe have created say open\nand then it says do you want to\nimport this data or bring this data into\nexisting worksheet\nyou can also say add this to a data\nmodel if you are doing some data\nmodeling so click on ok\nand now this data is automatically\ninserted in my excel file i can\nbasically save it\ninto\nthis particular sheet now what we can\nalso do is we can also start a new sheet\nand that does not have a data and we can\nget some other data from web\nso what i can do is i can go into my\ngithub and let's say i would be\ninterested in this csv file so i can\nselect this\nand this is my github path a path on web\nso i can click on draw and that\nbasically gives me\nthe raw path where this particular file\nis now you can select this\ncopy this particular path\nand here you can come back to your excel\nsheet we would be interested in getting\nthe data from web might be from a text\nfile where we will have to specify the\ndelimiters or let's go to web\nand here\ni can given the web path from where i\nwould be interested in getting the file\nlet's give the github path which is\npublicly available and then click on\nimport now once you click on import it\ntells me there are two fields data and\nvalue\nthese are\nwithin double quotes separated by comma\nso first let's click on import\nnow once we do this it will basically\nget the data from web and put in here it\nsays existing worksheet so we had\nalready created a new worksheet so let's\nclick on ok\nand now you have the data coming in but\nthen this basically shows me in one\nparticular field so what we can also do\nis we can just do a control a that\nselects all my columns here\nand that's my data so we can then\nbasically\nfilter this out so we can say text to\ncolumns\nit's a delimited file click on next\nwe can select comma and\nlet the text qualifier be quotes\nit shows me data\npreview click on next so you have the\ngeneral format it shows the destination\nthat's the column\nclick on finish and now your data has\nbeen split and you have the data which\nyou have imported from web so this is\nthe data which is coming in from web\nthis is the data which came in from my\nlocal machine and similarly we can even\ncreate connection with an existing\ndatabase so i can basically click on\nconnections if i would want to do that\nso i have an option called connection\nhere\nand it says where the selected\nconnections are used\ni can basically click on add\ni can basically choose\nif i would want to get the files from\nnetwork or from computer like we did\nearlier\ni can click on browse for more which\nshould\nshow me different other options to\ncreate connections say you would want to\ncreate a new sql server connection you\ncan connect to a new data source coming\nin from different place you could\nbasically choose what kind of connection\nyou would you want so these are all the\ndifferent options which we can go for\nand we can basically connect to a\ndatabase for example\nif i have some database\nand say for example access database\ni can see if there are some files with\nthat particular database and i can\nimport it\nso similarly we can also\nuh click in here which says new query\nand that also gives you an option of\ngetting the data from your files from\nall these folders from databases so you\ncan basically\nclick here and then you can import data\nfrom a mysql database provided that is\nset up on your local machine or on a\nparticular server you can go from cloud\nyou can get it from online services you\ncan get it from other sources which says\nfrom web\nfrom your hadoop file system from active\ndirectory from a blank query and you can\neven combine queries wherein you can run\na power query editor you can get the\ndata from different sources and then you\ncan bring it into your excel so in this\nway you can get your data from different\nsources into your excel\ninto your spreadsheet and then you can\ncontinue working on those data sets\nwe have\nalready learned some basic operations\nwhich you can do in excel and let's\nimplement our knowledge by working on\nthis particular data which is coming in\nfrom housing data set\nnow here if we see some fields we have\nagent\ndate listed area list price and this is\nbasically the data which has been\nsorted in newest to oldest order of date\nlisted\nso how do we\narrive at this so what i can do is i can\njust click on data listed\nand then\ni can either\ngo in here\ni can select sort i can get into custom\nsort\nand then i can choose the column\nbased on which i would want to sort the\ndata so i would look for the newest data\nto the oldest data that means that would\nbe in a descending order of dates or you\ncould say the oldest date or the\nearliest month will be towards the lower\nside of your sheet so here we can select\ndate listed now i can say let it sort\nbased on cell values and the order what\nwe have here so we have newest to oldest\nso let's select this\ni can say okay and now if you see the\ndate has been sorted so we have your\n10 18 2007 on the top so that seems to\nbe the latest date and as we go down we\nwill see\nan earlier month hour and\nearlier month than that in this date\nlisted so we have sorted our data\ninto newest to oldest order and that's\nbased on your\ndate column so the result shows up here\nnow what we can also do is we can have\ndifferent questions which we would want\nto answer so for example i would want to\nsort the data in ascending order of area\nand descending order of agent name how\ndo we do that so let's look into this so\nthis is here i already have the result\nhere and how did i get this so i'm\nlooking for ascending order of area in\ndescending order of agent name so we can\nstart with any particular column that\ndoes not matter so for example if i look\ninto this excel sheet i have my agent\nname select this which we want in a\ndescending order so we could either do a\nsort and then go for\ndescending sort z to a we could also use\nthe filter option here on the top right\nand we could do it or i could just say\nsort z to a and then it\nhas arranged the data\nbased on the agent column being in\ndescending order now i can go into area\nand then i can again do a sort and i\nwanted my area column\nto be used for\nsorting the data ascending to descending\nand that basically not only changes the\norder of this particular column but for\nmy complete data so let's do that and\nnow if you see we have the\ndata which has been sorted so\nwe can see how many values we have here\nand the area values which we see and\nthis is how you get your result so i'll\njust do a ctrl z\nand\nagain and i'm back to my original data\nand this is the sorted result which we\nare seeing at\nsimilarly we can answer other questions\nfor example sort the data according to\nthe following order\nof area\nthat is we are saying county\ncentral and then your county so we can\nbasically choose in which particular way\nwe would want to do it so it is county\ncentral and then again county so if i\nlook into my sheet 3 so here i basically\nhave my data which is\nhaving some south county then you have\nyour central and then you have your\nnorth county so we would want to\nsort the data to solve our problem which\nis\naccording to the following order so\nfirst we go for area then we go for\nsouth county central and north county so\nwhat we can do is we can basically\nhave area field selected\nand i would want to sort this particular\ndata so i have south county central and\nnorth county so i can basically go for\ncustom\nsort and then i can choose which is the\nvalue or column which i'm interested in\nlet's go for area\nwe will go for something like\ncell values well you can also try to\nexplore conditional formatting icon\nif this is what you would want to use\nor\nwe can basically go for just cell values\nand here we can say\nif i would be interested in first\ngetting my values for\nsouth county so\nfor example i can say custom list\nand then i can basically given the new\nlist here so i can say s\ndot county\nand then i would want central\nand then i would want north county\nso let's select this\nas it exists\nwe can\nbasically say add\nand that's basically the order which we\nwant to say okay\nand then say okay here\nand now what we would want is we would\nwant our data so we can compare that\nwith the values which we see here it\nstarts with kelly you have in the 12th\nrow something like lang and that's what\nwe are doing so we can basically arrange\nthe data in a particular order by\nchoosing a custom list and then sorting\nyour data\nso that's one more simpler task of what\nwe have done\nwhere we have sorted the data\nin the order where\nunder our area column we first wanted\nsouth county\nthen we wanted central data and then we\nwanted north county so this is how you\ncan do it\nnow\nlet's look into one more problem so it\nsays find all the houses in the central\narea\nand we would want to basically apply a\nregular filter let's let's see how do we\ndo that so we can click on this and here\nwe have the data so the problem\nstatement is we would want to find all\nthe houses in central\narea\nnow how do we do that we can do a\nsorting but\nwe would want to use the filter which\nyou see here\nis implemented so how do you do it so\nyou can select this area and say for\nexample i would want to apply filter i\ncan just go in here and i can say let's\nget a filter on my first row and now i\nhave filters applied so we are\ninterested in looking into the central\narea houses let's go in here it says\nall these fields are selected that means\nit shows everything\nwherein your area has all these values\nlet's unselect this and then i will only\nbe interested in the central so let's\nsay okay\nand then say okay so now you see that\nthe area\nfilter has been applied and we are\nlooking at the central column so what we\nhave done is we have applied a symbol\nfilter and we are looking at our data at\nany point of time if you do not\nwant\nthe filter\nthen what i can do is i can select this\nand i can say well i'm interested in all\nthe data\nso i could do this or you can clear the\nfilters from area and you get your data\nback\nso\nthat's in one way you can filter out\nyour data so let's look at an example of\nsort and filter where we might have to\nfilter the data based on two columns\nor multiple columns with different kind\nof values where it could be and and or\ncondition now say for example this is\nthe data i have and this is the question\nwhich we need to answer such as find the\nlist of all houses\nin the central region with pool\nand south county without pool now if it\nwas a simple filter based on one cell i\ncould have\njust selected my\nheader row i could have then applied the\nfilter\nand once i have the filter i can look in\narea where i have three regions so i'm\nonly interested in central and south\ncounty so i can get rid of north county\nand that's fine but then\nwe have two different conditions here so\nwe need\nthe data in central region to have\nthe value for pool being true\nand for south county the value has to be\nwithout pool now how do we do that so\nwhat we can do is we can first create a\ncopy of these headers here\nso let me do that\nnow the area has to be south county so\nbasically i can\neither just select this and i can choose\nthis value\nand then i can select this and then i\ncan choose central so that's the\ncriteria which i have and the pool value\nhas to be\nso central region should be with pool so\nthen this one\nbasically has to be true\nand\nthis one has to be basically false so\nsouth county is without pool so let's\nselect one of the values here and this\nis my criteria now\nto get my result uh we can always place\nyour cursor here and you can check this\nis m column and eighth row\nokay so we would want the result here so\nlet's go ahead and now click on data and\nthen in filter you have an option called\nadvanced and here what i can do is i can\nsay i would want to filter the list in\nthe place but that's not what i would\nwant to do so i'll say copy to another\nlocation and here if you see the list\nrange will tell me\nthat this is the data so a1 to j126 so a\nto j column selected and all the rows\ncriteria range is basically based on\nwhat i've given here so that is m\nfrom 1\nto v\nwhich is 3\nso i'm selecting these columns and then\ni'm saying all the way whatever criteria\ni've given and copy 2 i'm saying m8\nto v8 so that basically will give me my\nfiltered result so you could basically\njust say okay and now i have my data\nwhich has been filtered\nand i have my area which is south county\nthat is without pool central with pool\nagain south county without pool\nand then if you look at your central\nvalue that's pool so this is an advanced\nfilter which we have applied where\nsimply we have filtered the data based\non two columns and then we have our\nresult so in this way you can have your\ncustomized filter applied on two\ndifferent columns and get your data\nwhich can be either\nreplacing the existing content or\nin the same sheet in different set of\ncolumns and rows you can have your\nresult let's look at one more example of\nfiltering where you are trying to filter\nthe data based on a and condition\ncondition being met in two different\ncolumns and then you would want to\nfilter out\nthe data for only specific columns so\nthe situation is the agents with a house\nin north county that should be county\narea having two\nand a single type family so we are\ntalking about two bedrooms\nand\nwe would basically have a single type\nfamily and here the criteria is that we\nwould want to\nonly populate these columns which is\nagent area bedroom and type now what you\ncan do is as i explained earlier that\nyou can get your result in\nthe same sheet in a different location\nso here i have created these headers\nwhich says agent area bedrooms and type\nnow this is basically a copy of all the\ncolumns what we have here agent data\nlisted area list price bedrooms bath\nsquare feet and so on so you can\nbasically create a copy of the headers\nhere and this is where we will give our\nadvanced criteria to filter the data so\nthe conditions which need to be met is\nwe need to look at north county\nso for example here in area i can\nbasically go ahead and select one of the\nvalues north county\nnow the criteria is having two bedrooms\nonly so let's say bedrooms and let's say\nthe value should be two\nand then basically i'm saying a single\ntype family so when you would want the\nsingle type family so here under type i\ncan give the criteria single type\nso\nthis is my and condition so we are\nsaying north county area having two\nbedrooms and the type is single family\nnow this is the criteria which basically\nmeans if i select this this one tells me\nthat this is m\none row onwards till v\ntwo\nso this is what we have and we would\nwant to filter based on this so let's go\nahead and then go for data filter\nadvanced\nand here in advanced it says filter the\nlist in place now that's not what we\nwould want to do so i'll say copy to\nanother location\nthis basically selects the list range so\nwhich is telling me\na1\nto\nj126 so that's the\ncolumns and rows selected criteria range\nis based on m 1 v 2 which we have given\nhere\nand copy 2 i would say for example from\nm 7\nto\np\n7 now this is the area where i would\nthis is the place where i want the\nresult let's say ok and now i get my\ndata which is\nbased on the question which has been\nasked that you would want the agents\nwith a house in north county area having\ntwo bedrooms and single type family so\nin this way you can basically do\nadvanced filtering\nget your data and get it stored in the\nsheet anywhere at a different location\nwell i could have also done filtering in\nplace and that would have replaced the\ndata\nwhich we have but that's not what we\nwant we would want the filtered result\nin a different place so this is how you\ncan do some advanced filtering we can\nalso use excel to filter out the data in\none particular column which might be\nconditional or say\nusing some numerical filters now here\nsay for example the problem statement is\nthat you would want to display all the\nhouses whose list price is between\n45 000 to 600 000\nor say for example we would want to\nfilter out the data to something else\nsay for example let's say i have\ni would want to filter out the data\nbetween 300 000 and 400 000 so we can\nbasically\nupdate this\nsay for example i am saying i am\ninterested in 300\n000\nto\n400\n000 and that's the criteria to filter\nout the data now there are two different\nways or there are two easier ways to do\nit one is\ni would want to\nlook at the list price so i can select\nthis\ni can go ahead and do a filter here\nand in the list price now this is where\nwe would want to do the filtering so\nit's pretty easy you can click on this\none and then you can go into number\nfilters and you can choose between now\nthat's one easier way of doing it so i\ncould basically select this\ni could say i'm looking for value which\nis greater than or equal to 300 000\nand then is less than or equal to 400\n000 so if i just do this\ni have applied my filter and i have my\ndata which is filtered based on my\ncriteria right so that's one easier way\nof doing it or let me do a control\nz\nnow\nlet the filter be there which you can\nanyways use but what we can also do is\nas we have seen earlier methods so get a\nset or get your column headers here\nand then\nyou are giving two columns here now the\nonly difference between\nmy\nthis set of columns which i have 1 2 3 4\nand then you have 7 and 10 columns and\nif you see here\nwe have 4\n5\n6 7 8 9 10 11 right so whenever you want\na and condition you will basically\nadd the columns where i can give add\ncondition if it is the same column if it\nwas a different column then it would be\nsame number of columns but and\nconditions will lie in the same line\nand all condition would lie in a\ndifferent line now here i can give this\nvalue so i am looking for listed price\nbeing\nbetween 300 000 so i am saying it should\nbe greater than or equal to\n300 000 and then i can say less than or\nequal to\n400 000 now that's my criteria\nand then i need my result here\nwhich is in m7\nso what i can do is once i have given my\ncriteria which i'll be using\nto filter i can get into data i can get\ninto advanced\nand then i can say copy to another\nlocation so it is selecting my a1 to\nj126\ncriteria range is based on m1 to\nw2\nand then i would want my result from\nthis particular column\nso let's say okay and now you have your\ndata filtered out\nin a different location in the sheet\nwhich has been filtered based on your\nand condition so you can filter out the\ndata in this way or\nyou could just apply a filter on a\ncolumn and give the conditions\nnow let's solve one more interesting\nproblem and here we would want to use\nexcel where we would have an and and and\nor condition so say for example this is\nthe data given to you and the question\nis that you would want to find all the\nhouses in north county again that's a\nspelling mistake but then the\nnorth county area with a list price\ngreater than 300 000\nand having three or four bedrooms so the\nbedroom\nhas conditional so it has r three and\nfour\nand then basically you have\nlist price which is greater than 300 000\nnow i could have obviously\nselected the columns and then basically\ngone for a filter\nso i can just do a filtering here\nand then i'm looking for list price\nbeing greater than 300 000 so which we\ncan always give a number filter and i\ncan say greater than and then i can say\ngreater than or equal so i can say\ngreater than and then i can give three\nthousand thirty three hundred thousand\nand that's basically the filter which we\nwould want\nand\nhere i would want to select the bedrooms\nwhich should be just either three or\nfour\nso if for example here i go in here and\ni unselect this and then i say three and\nfour\nright so i am getting my data which is\ngreater than 300 000 and it should have\nthe bettering values which will be\neither three or four selected now that's\none way of doing it let's do a ctrl z\nand get it back\nto as we were or you can even just say\nclear filter so you get your data back\nas it was so what we can do is we can\nhere\ngive the criteria\nso for example i have my\nlist price now this is what i would want\nas a condition so let's say greater than\nthree hundred thousand\nthree hundred thousand and bedrooms\nshould be three\nand then i can say greater than three\nhundred thousand\nand then i can say four\nso this one basically gives me a\nsituation where your list price has to\nbe greater than 300 000\nand bedroom should be either three or\nfour so we have given our filtering\ncriteria now to get the result what we\ncan do is we can go into data we can go\ninto advanced\nand we can say copy to another location\nso our list range is selected which is\ncolumns a to j row number 1 to 126 your\ncriteria range is given in m1 to v3\nwhere we have specified and we are\nsaying the result would be in m7 to v7\nso if i do this now i have got the same\ndata which we were seeing earlier and\nhere the bedroom values are 3 or 4\nand basically the list price is greater\nthan 300 000 so this is a simpler way in\nwhich you can create your filters and\nall this advanced filtering what we are\nseeing it will be saved with your sheet\nyou can always go back and change this\nvalue or you could do filtering where\none person has to look into the filter\nto see what values have been selected\nnow that we have looked into\nsome operations which we can perform in\nexcel using filter or sorting the data\ncreating your tables let's also quickly\nlook at functions and formulas which can\nbe used\nfor\ndoing some easy calculations or\ncomputations now excel can be used in\ndifferent kind of data analysis so for\nexample you have different inbuilt\nfunctions\nwhich can be used and we can always\ncheck for a particular function so for\nexample if i had\nif i wanted to look at a particular\nfunction\ni could just\ntype in here\nsomething for example is and then it\nshows me all the possible functions and\nyou can always have a look at the detail\nof the function for example you have is\neven which will return true if the\nnumber is even\nif we would say is logical so i could\nsearch for\nis logical and that tells me whether a\nvalue is logical value true or false and\nreturns your value true and false\nnow we can\nobviously\nsay subtotal so you can search for any\nof these useful functions and that tells\nme what this function can be used for so\nreturns a subtotal in a list or a\ndatabase\nyou have many other such functions such\nas integer sum\naverage\nyou may be interested in working on\ntruncating\nsome data getting the absolute value\ngetting the square root\nbasically getting a count or getting a\nmax value you can look for any\nparticular functions within your excel\nsheet\nnow you also have other functions such\nas now or time for example let's look at\nnow function\nso i can search for\nnow\nand here it is\nso this is returns the current date and\ntime formatted as a date and time so\nthis is the function which we would want\nto use\nand if i just give the function it tells\nme what is the current time\nlet's first look at the description of\ntime here so\nsay for example i would want time it\nsays converts hours minutes and seconds\ngiven as numbers to an excel serial\nnumber formatted with the time format so\nfor example if i would say\n2 hours\nand then\n30 minutes\nand 30 seconds and if i do this it has\nbasically converted this into your time\nformat so you can always use\ndifferent inbuilt functions for your\nwork now we will also look at some\nadvanced functions like sum f or some\nifs\nyou have count f and count ifs\nand you can be working on various\nfunctionalities\nof excel to\neasily help you in doing some\ncalculations computations working with\nyour data\nworking with your different cell values\nso let's look at some example of using\nfunctions like sum or sum if\nso for that\nlet's go to this sheet and here we have\nsome data now i have already applied a\nfilter which can allow me to filter out\nthe data so it says find the total units\nthat were sold in the east region now we\nknow\nthat in region we have east\nand i have multiple regions i could\nbasically be\nsaying\nunselect all and select only east\nand say okay and that basically gives me\nthe units which were sold and if i place\nmy cursor here and then if i did a auto\nsum\nso it would basically give me\nthe function which is being used so\nsomething like subtotal and it is\nbasically working on\nyour\nrows which is e2 to e44\nand here\nwe can just do this so that gives me the\ntotal but this is this is\nfine you could do that but\nit would be good if we know how do we\nuse a function like sum if to do that so\nhere i am seeing this is the subtotal\nwhere i'm looking at the values and\nbasically what i have done is i have\nfiltered out the region\nand\nthen basically i am getting a count but\nthis does not give me clearly how a sum\nwas calculated from all the values which\nwere listed what we can also do is let's\ndo a control z and let's get it back\nso now we have our data and we would\nwant to get the total units that were\nsold in the east region so what i can do\nis i can start typing in my formula\nand for that i'll use an inbuilt\nfunction so for example i would be\ninterested in going for sumif now it\nsays sumif adds the cells specified by a\ngiven condition or criteria when you\ntalk about some ifs this is when you\ncould give set of conditions or multiple\ncriteria so let's look at some if\nlet's do this now obviously this gives\nme an error because the formula\nis not right so we have to basically\ncome in here and let's start with sum\nif now when i say sum if it shows me\nthere is a function with sumif which we\nwould want to use\nand here\nonce i open up the bracket it tells me\nokay what is the range of data which you\nare interested in so i am interested in\nall the units that were sold in the east\nregion so we are interested in the\nregion\nwhich is here\nso\ni can basically be\nselecting this\nand this tells me\nyou are interested in the data here so\nlet's not take the header value so let's\nsay b2\nand then we can\ngo all the way to the end so we can\nbasically select this way\nthat's the data we have select this and\nhit\nenter\nso\nnow here\nit has selected b2 to b4 but we need to\nbasically now give the criteria\nso the criteria is either a value or you\ncan point it to a cell which has that\nparticular value so as per our problem\nstatement we are looking for the units\nwhich are sold in east region so i can\nselect the value east here\nand then\nmy sum if needs the range on which you\nwant to\ncalculate a sum so\nlet's select this and now we are\ninterested in finding out the sum of\nunits so that's basically this column e\ncolumn so i can basically type in\ninstead of selecting so i can say e\nand i'm interested in e2 2\ne\n44 so that basically selects the area\nor all the values and now let's do this\nso that basically gives me the sum is 6\n91\nright now this is the criteria where i\nhave pointed it to a cell and whatever\nvalue that cell has well i could have\ndone\nsomething like this so i could have\nselected east\ngiving the value\nand then doing it it still does the same\nthing and in this way you have more\nclarity that you are using some if you\nare filtering the data so you have given\nthe rows\nyou are given the criteria and then you\nhave given the range\non which you would want to sum up the\nvalues\nnow similarly if the question was what\nwas the total revenue generated from\nbinder\nnow\nwe would want to find out what is the\ntotal revenue generated from binders\nthat means\nmy filtering criteria will be binder\nand then i want to find out the total\nrevenue generated so we have the revenue\ngenerated field also here\nand we have we don't have any region to\nbe filtered we are just looking for\nbinder so let's again start doing the\nsame thing so we can go for some if we\ncan open the bracket now it needs the\nrange\nso we are interested in\nrevenue generated now that's the\nsummation we want and we would want to\nget the range of data so here\nwe can basically select\nuh\nd\n2\n2 d\n44\nso that's the data selected now i would\nwant to give the filtering criteria so\nlet's say binder\nand then we need to give the range on\nwhich the sum needs to be calculated so\nthat's my\nrevenue column so that's g\nso i can say g\n2\nto g\n44\nand that basically selects the column\nand then you get your sum so it tells me\nwhat is the total revenue generated from\nbinder\nnow i could be doing this for other\nthings also so say for example if you\nwould want to filter out something else\nyou could basically just drag and drop\nhere and then i could come here and\nchange this to say\ninstead of binder i would be interested\nin say\npencil\nif that's the criteria you are\ninterested in\nremember to change this so that you take\nall the values\nand here we will change\nit to select the relevant rows and then\nthis is the data i am getting so i know\nthat this is\nthe revenue generated\nfrom pencil this is the revenue\ngenerated from binder now this is a\nsimple use case where we are using some\nif what if we would want to use some ifs\nso some ifs\nlet's have a look at how we get to some\nifs\nso some if says where you would want to\nwork on\ndoing some calculation but then\nyou would want\nmultiple criterias to be met so let's\nsee how we get this\nso here what i can do is\nlet's work on this problem statement\nwhich says what is the total revenue\ngenerated from central region\nwhere the item is a pencil\nso that's\nsomething which i would want to check\nnow when we are answering this question\nwe can also look at the order in which\nthings have been asked in the question\nso it says what is the total revenue\ngenerated from central region so we need\nthe total revenue generated we know\nthere is a revenue column\nwe are interested in getting the total\nrevenue generated\nwe are saying\nthe\nfiltering criteria is central region\nand we say in that we would be\ninterested only in the item if it is\npencil how do i do it so i can use\nsumifs where you can pass in multiple\ncriteria so let's start with\nsome ifs\nand when i start with some ifs let's\nopen up the bracket so it says sum range\nit says criteria range\nthen it gives one criteria and you can\nin any number of criterias so for\nexample we are interested in total\nrevenue generated now that's my g column\nso let's follow in the same order so\nlet's say g\n2\nso that's my first value and then i know\nthere are 44 rows here so i can say g\n44\nand you can obviously check\nif that has selected all the rows\nnow\nthat's my total revenue generated so i\nwould want the total revenue generated\nso i'm saying setting this sum range\nthen\ni need to give the criteria range so it\nsays from central region so central\nregion comes into column 2 that's b\nso let's say b\n2 to b 44 so that's my criteria range\nthen you have to give\nyour criteria but\nwe need to filter out the region being\ncentral so let's select this now either\ni could point to a value in the cell or\ni can just\ngive the exact value here\nwe can also give a\nwildcard or matching pattern so that\nalso works now this one is fine\nwe are now also interested in finding\nthe total revenue generated when the\nregion is central and the item is pencil\nhow do we do that so for\nitem we know the columns the column is\nd2\nso let's select d 2\n2 d\n44\nso that basically selects\nall the rows in the d column and we need\nto give the\nfiltering criteria so let's do a comma\nand then\njust given our value so let's say pencil\nand then let's close your bracket and\nthat basically gives you the result\nso\nwe need to just follow the order of our\nquestion which says what is the total\nrevenue generated so we are looking at\nthe revenue column we are selecting all\nthe rows\nthen it says\nfrom the central region so we need to\nselect the region column and give the\nfiltering criteria central or point to a\ncell which contains that value\nand then it says we would be interested\nonly in item being pencil\nso then you select the column which has\nall the items and provide your filtering\ncriteria that is pencil\nso that's your\neasy calculation of using sum if which\nwe compare with\nsum if here so sum if here was\njust\nhaving\nyour criteria\nso basically you are selecting your rows\ngiving your filtering criteria and then\nyour sum range in some ifs we are giving\nmultiple condition now same thing can be\ndone here it says how many units were\nsold by sales representative john's\nor jones\nwhere the cost of each item was greater\nthan four\nso how many units were sold by\nsales representative\nso when we talk about how many units\nthat's your e column\nso let's start with that so let's say\nsome ifs\ni would be interested in e\ncolumn\nand let's give the range\nso it says sum range so those are the\nnumber of units on which we would want\nto find\nthe sum\nthen it says you need to give the\ncriteria range so we say sales\nrepresentative where the name is\njones\nso sales representative is in sales rep\ncolumn c so let's say c2\nto c444\nnow\nthen we need to give our filtering\ncriteria so let's say jones\nis the sales representative where we are\ninterested\nabout whom we are interested in\nand then we\nthe question says where the cost of each\nitem\nso cost of each item is what we are\ninterested in\nyou have unit cost\nso that's what we are interested in so\nthat would be f\nand then say f2 to f44\nand then you need to give\nyour cost\nso it says where each item\nis greater than\n4\nso let's select this\nand let's\ndo this so this tells me 3 0 1\nnow\nsimilarly let's answer our third\nquestion which says how many units did\njones sell excluding\npencil item so we would want to find out\nwhat was the total number of unique\nunits that were sold\nand\nthat\nunits or that should not include the\npencil item how do we start doing this\nso let's start with sum ifs\nnow we know that you start with some ifs\nyou need to give the sum range so we are\ninterested in the number of units\nso let's basically go in and select\nour\nnumber of units which were sold so\nthat's your column e\nso i can say e2 to e44\nthat's where i would want to perform\nthis sum\nnow i'm saying\nhow many units that were sold where\nwe are talking about sales rep being\njones so let's see\nlet's select the columns\nc\nand then give\nthe range\nafter that we need to give our giving\nfiltering criteria which is jones and\nthen we are interested in\nthe items but excluding pencil so items\nis in column d so let's say d to d 44\nand then\nwe have to give\nour\ncriteria so we can say\nwell that should exclude\npencil\nso i can basically say\npencil\nand let's close this\nand let's check so that's my formula\nwhich says\nthat these are the number of units which\nthe sales representative whose name is\njones had\nsold and that does not include pencil as\nan item let's also look at an example of\nusing countif or count ifs now both of\nthese can be very useful when you would\nwant to calculate certain values\nso for example if i would want to work\non count f let's try solving this\nproblem\nnow remember you can answer these\nquestions using filters and that can be\nan easier way but then sometimes you may\nwant to\nget the formulas so that you can make\nyour spreadsheet and your calculation\nmore\ndynamic in nature and that will\nbasically depend on the values in the\ncolumns or rows so for example\nif i have find the total number of times\ngil has made a sale now if i look at my\ndata here\nit tells me that for every sales\nrepresentative there is some value\nin the sale and it says sales has\ngreater than 3\nso for example jones you have sales\ngreater than 3\nor\nyou have jardine which is sales greater\nthan 3 and so on so what we are\ninterested in\nis\ndoing a quick count in finding out the\ntotal number of times gil has made a\nsale how do we do that so we can use\nthis count if function and if i go into\ncountif it says counts the number of\ncells within a range that meet the given\ncondition now what's our condition our\ncondition is kill and we would want to\nfind out how many times the name say\ngill appears or kill has made a sale now\ni could just say count if and then open\nup a bracket i need to give a range so\nlet's say we are interested in looking\nat the range\nso let's say\nwe will choose\nsales rep so i can say c and then i can\nsay c 2\nto\nc 44\nnow\nthat's my\nrange\nlet's not give that in quotes\nso you have to give a range so let's do\na count if that selects the data\nand then we need to give the condition\nso for example let's here give the name\nwhich is gil\nand then\nclose this so that basically tells me it\nis five times kill appears here we can\ncheck this so i can go in here i can\nadd a filter\nand then might be i would be interested\ninterested in looking at only gil\nand that basically gives me five\nright so we can always do that and we\ncan be using formulas like this now what\nabout this question so which basically\nsays which sales representative made a\nsale more than three times now we it\nmight be looking a little confusing when\ni say for example let me clear out this\nfilter\nnow\nwe have sales greater than three and we\nwould want to find out\nwhich sales representative made a sale\nmore than three times\nnow i could basically check for every\nsales representative here if they have\nmade a sale more than three times and\nwhat i can do is i can just say equals i\ncan start with count if\nthen i need\nmy\nfiltering criteria\nso that's your range\nso first thing is we will choose for\nexample let's choose c2\nto c 44\nand then we need to\ngive and criteria what is the criteria\nwe need basically a sales representative\nso i can choose the value here\nin c2\nand then\ni can close this\nand then i can say the sale has to be\ngreater than three\nand let's check so it tells me the\nboolean value that yes\nthis guy has made\nsales more than three times and what we\ncan do is we can just\ndrag and drop which basically gives me\nthe value for other sales rep you can\nalways check the value is automatically\nchanging to this value in cell\nand for example let's go in here so this\nis obviously two so it says me false\nright and you can basically get the\nvalues for all your values\nso that basically tells me which\nsales representative has made a sale\nmore than three times\nnow like some ifs we also have countifs\nwhere you can give multiple criterias so\nfor example the question is how many\norders were placed from the east region\nafter this particular date so we have\na date criteria we also have the region\ncriteria and we need to basically\nget the count of number of orders which\nwere placed now i can in this case use\ncount\nifs\nand this basically says that you can\nstart within criteria so it says how\nmany orders were placed from east region\nafter\nparticular date so date is in my\nfirst column so for example\ni could say a\nstart with 2 and say for example let's\ngo a 44\nthat should have selected all the rows\nand then i need to\nonce i've given the criteria range i\nneed to give the criteria so we are\nsaying\nthe date has to be greater than\n10th feb\nso let's give it\n2\n10\n2019 and then you need to say\nhow many orders were placed so you need\nto give the criteria second criteria\nrange\nso we are looking at the number of\norders which were placed\nfrom the east region\nso when i would want to look at the\nregion that's your column b\nso i can basically say b2 to b 44\nand here\ni would basically\ngive my criteria so the criteria is east\nlet's give that\nand once you have done this you would\nwant to find out the total number of\norders so let's select this\nand if i do this it tells me 13\nnow is that right so we are looking for\nyour\ndate your region being east and then\ngetting the total number of orders so\nhere i can just do a count if\ni am saying a2\nto a44\nwherein i have given the date criteria\nthat it should be greater than\n10th feb because i do not want to count\n10 feb it says after 10 february\nand then you are saying the region has\nto be east\nso we would want to find out the total\nnumber of orders so\nmy region is east and that gives me the\nresult\nnow similarly you can also find out how\nmany times gil\nsold pencils so\nhere we will have to give the range so\nlet's start with count\nifs\nnow here i would want\nthat item is pencils so we can as well\nselect column\nd to\nd 44\nthen you have to give your criteria so\nthat's your\npencil\nand then\nwe are looking for sales rep which is\nkill so\nthat is my column c\nso let's say c 2\n2 c\n44\nand the value should be\njust kill\nso it tells me it's twice where gil has\nsold pencils so we can obviously check\nthis by\ngoing in here\nchoosing my filter\nand then let's search for rep being just\ngill\nokay and now we are interested only in\nthe item being pencil\nso i can say well let's get to pencil\nonly and that tells me twice\nso you can obviously re-verify using\nfilters but using functions or using\nformulas\nit is always good to calculate and that\ncan be making your computation and\ncalculation more dynamic\nlet's look at one more interesting\nfeature of excel and that's your\nconditional formatting now as you see on\nthe screen\nconditional formatting has different\nrules which can be applied on your data\nand that allows you to basically\ndifferentiate or easily identify data\nvalues which\nare\nbased on certain criterias or rules so\nwhen you talk about conditional\nformatting you have different options\nsuch as you can highlight cell rules you\ncan get top and bottom values you can\napply different rules apply different\ncolor scales and you\nyou can easily manage these rules\nso conditional formatting is very useful\nfor people who would want to work on\nhuge amount of data and easily perform\nsome data analysis\nit's easy to use as it is shown here and\nwith your conditional formatting\nyou can format cells based on a preset\ncondition\nyou can perform conditional formatting\nto identify cells\nyou can highlight a few significant\ncells and you can easily perform\nconditional formatting\nas shown\non the left side\nnow how do we work with conditional\nformatting let's have a quick look\nso say for example we have our excel\nsheet and if you see here\ni am highlighting\nthe sales person who have generated\nrevenue greater than 10 000.\nso\nwe can be looking at the values where\nthe revenue generated by a particular\nsales person is greater than 10 000 it\nhas a particular\ncolor and how do we get here so for\nexample let's select\nthis data\nand what i could do is\ni could go into conditional formatting\nnow i could basically highlight cell\nrules and we could just say greater than\nthat's an easier way i could also go\nahead and create a new rule but then i\ncan use one of this option i can say\ngreater than\nand let's give some value might be we\nwould be interested in looking at\nany value greater than twelve thousand\nso let's choose twelve\nthousand\nand here it says what color would you\nwant to select so for example\ni would say\nsomething like\nyellow filled with dark yellow text\nand let's say okay so right now what i'm\ndoing is\ni have all the values where the revenue\ngenerator was greater than 10 000\nbut then i have also selected all the\nsales\npeople who have made or who have\ngenerated revenue greater than 12 000.\nso i can just wait ctrl z to see the\nprevious result now here\ni had the values which were greater than\n10 000\nand the one which we did just now\nbasically\nhighlighted the values which are greater\nthan 12 000. so this is one simple\nexample now we can look at some other\nexamples say for example you want to\nformat cells using three color scale so\nif you look at the values here i have a\nthree color scale mainly in green yellow\nand red\nand how do you do this so for example i\ncan go in here\nand i can go to conditional formatting\nso i would want to\ngo for color scales and here\nyou can create different rules so\nwe can set up a two color scale so we\ncan say format\nonly values that are above and below\naverage i can format only cells that\ncontain something\ni can get the top and bottom values so\nthese are different ways in which\ni can\nhave a three color based scale now what\ni will do is i will select this\nand let me show you the rule which i\nhave so for example\ni can go into manage rules and if you\nsee here there are certain rules which\nhave been specified now what does that\nmean\nso you would want to specify a three\ngrade scale\nso for example if i would want to look\nat my first rule\nit tells me that i am choosing three\ncolor scale i can choose lowest value\npercentile and highest value and that\nbasically will\nselect the cells based on their values\nso what we could have done is i can\nbasically\nuse one of these values i can delete\nthese rules which i have created\nso for example\ni have all these rules\nbut you should always carefully remember\nthat the rules will be applied in the\norder shown so for example if i just\ndelete these rules\nand then say apply and say okay my data\nis back now\nit does not have any highlighting now i\ncan go in here\ni can say condition sorry conditional\nformatting\ni could go for color scale so i could\nbasically go into\nnew rule\nso i would want\nthe\ncells to be using three color scale so\nlet's\nchoose three color scale now when you\nsay three color scale it says what will\nbe the color of lowest value\nand we could choose might be any one of\nthis let's choose red\ni can say midpoint is percentile 50\nand then the highest value is green and\nif that looks good let's say okay and\nnow if you see the lowest values have\nbeen highlighted as red\nyou have mid values and then\nyou have the positive value so this is\nthe three color scale and that\neasily helps me in identifying the data\nbased on the cell values\nnow in conditional formatting what you\ncan also do is you can\nbasically color the cells based on their\nvalue so what we are seeing here\nis if the revenue\ngenerated\nis greater than average\nthen that shows in green\nand if the revenue generated is lesser\nthan average that's shows in orange now\nhow do we do that so we can basically\nagain manage some rules so i can\nbasically create a new rule\nnow here i can select one of the options\nwhich says format only values that are\nabove or below average and that's the\noption i would want to select now i can\nselect this and it says format values\nthat are above average so\nin our case we had it in green so for\nexample i'll say above average and then\nhere i can go for\na particular color\nso you can go for a particular size\nso\nlet's go and look into\nthe formatting\nso for example let's choose yellow\nsay okay now i'm saying\nwherever\nthe cell values are above average it\nwould be yellow instead of green\nand let's go in here\nlet's go and look into manage rules so\nthis is\nbasically the rule which we are applying\nnow we can also add a new rule\nand\ni need to\nselect the values so for example i will\nsay\nhere so we had gone for above now we'll\ngo for below\nwe'll go for format we will choose red\nwe'll say okay we'll say\nnow\nthese are\nbasically\nthe rules which we have created and here\nit says applies to your data so right\nnow it has not been applied so for\nexample if i select this and then\ni could basically\nchoose my area just hit on enter\nand similarly you can go in here and\nthen select your area\nhit on enter and say apply say okay and\nnow if you see\ni have really chosen bright colors but\nthen i have said wherever my revenue\ngenerated is\nabove average\nit should be in yellow and\nbelow average should be in red so we\nwanted above\naverage to be in green and below average\nto be in orange so\nthat's what we have here right so you\ncan always\ncolor code your cell values based on\nsome rules which you are setting up now\nsimilarly you can also\nfind the top 10 and bottom 10 values and\nthat's pretty easy so you can just\nselect this\nand then you can go into conditional\nformatting you can go for top and bottom\nvalues top 10 items bottom 10 items\nor you can go in for more rules so you\ncan say format only top or bottom ranked\nvalues so you have top 10\nnow you can choose the color\nand for example i'll go for\nblue\nand\ni'll say okay\nso now if you see my top 10 values are\nblue now similarly i can add one more\nrule so i can say new rule and i can say\nlet's go for top or bottom\nlet's go for bottom let's go for format\nlet's say orange\nsay okay\nsay okay and that's it so now you have\nyour values which are top or bottom 10\nvalues\nso you are using conditional formatting\nwhere you are\nbasically highlighting your cell values\nbased on different colors and here\neasy conditional formatting based on\ndifferent rules helps us to do that now\nsimilarly you can also\nhave the values\nwhich is basically\nshowing you how the values are\nincreasing\nso what\nwe can do is we can select our columns\neither you could apply this to all the\ncolumns now here i have applied this\nonly to jan and april now i could apply\nthis for june so let's say june so you\ncan go for gradient fill you can go for\nsolid fill\nyou can obviously just select the color\nand that takes care of the things\nyou can say for example select this and\nnow this is selected what i would want\nto\nmight be format this so i can go in here\ni can go into manage rules now that will\ntell me\nwhat rule has been applied\nin the order so i can just do a edit\nrule and that basically says this is a\nsolid fill\nwhich is color you have no border this\nis basically color as black now i can go\nfor something like gradient fill\nand i can say okay and now if i say\napply and okay so this basically is like\nyour first column so you can use\nconditional formatting for various use\ncases and you can highlight the values\nso anyone who would look at the value\nwould automatically notice which are the\nhigher values which are lower values\nmight be\nhere the revenue is getting generated or\nwas getting generated but did not grow\nbeyond a particular value\nand so on\nnow similarly you can also go in for\ndifferent options\nsay for example here we would want to\nsee if the revenue was dropping\nor if the revenue was\nif the revenue decreased\nor say for example if the revenue was\ngoing up for this particular salesperson\nso here we are looking at carol\nso in jan the revenue generation by\nsales was very high\nthen in feb it was falling down\nin march it was\nkind of stable\nthen in april it went way below so we\ncan obviously work\non this wherein we can grade our cell\nvalues so what we can do is we can\ngo in for\nhighlighting the cell values now\nyou can go for color scales you can go\nfor icon sets\nand this is where you can choose your\ndifferent shapes\nso you could choose one of these shapes\nso for example\ni would be interested in looking at the\nindicators like directional i could go\nusing this three arrows i can go in for\nthis color i can choose directional and\nthen\nmy values are automatically\nusing directional now what we can also\ndo is we can then go into manage rules\nand that basically tells me what rules\nhave been applied\nso for example the latest one is the\nicon set which i have chosen it shows\nthe selected columns i can obviously do\na edit rule and then i can choose so i'm\nsaying the format style is\nicon sets\ni'm not using a data bar i'm not using\ncolor scale\nnow here\ni have chosen the style of icons\nand then here\nyou can basically give some values so\nyou have icon which is green when the\nvalue is greater than or equal to 67\npercentage\nwhen i say\nhyphen or minus it is less than 67\nit's way below 33 percentage\nthen you give this value so you can\nobviously edit and easily\nhighlight your cell values based on this\nicon set so i can apply this and that's\nhow i use conditional formatting so\nconditional formatting can be very\nuseful\nif you would want to use icon set if you\nwant to use your data bars if you would\nwant to\nhighlight particular values\nif you would want to color code based on\nsome calculation\nif you would want to\nuse a three color or a two color scale\nor if you would want to just find out\nvalues based on some simple calculation\nso conditional formatting is used\nextensively by data analysts\nor people who are working business\nintelligence teams or people who would\nwant to use excel\nto easily identify the data\neasily identify the cells which contain\nparticular value\nor finding out less significant or more\nsignificant cells\nto then pull out values and carry out\nyour computations calculations\nor analysis\nso let's continue learning on using\nexcel for various things now we have\nlearnt on conditional formatting and\nseen how that can be very helpful let's\nlearn one more feature of excel and\nthat's basically your data validation\nnow this can be very useful when you\nwould want to work on\nvalidating the data which is being fed\nin the cells so you could limit it to\nbasically a number between a particular\nvalue you could also add some messages\nto it\nif you would want\nor you could even\ncircle invalid data or clear validation\ncircles so data validation really helps\nus in validating the data which is being\nfed in to particular fields\nnow it's a feature in excel which is\nmainly used to control what a user can\nfill in a cell you can decide what type\nof values must be entered\nyou can also\nrestrict user to enter only valid data\nand if any invalid data is entered an\nerror message will be displayed\nnow that's where you can use your data\nvalidations so let's see how that can be\ndone so for data validation let's see\nsome exercises here so for example you\nhave a name column and you would want to\nrestrict\nthat the name should accept only 15\ncharacters now how do you do that so you\ncan basically select the cells\nor\nyou can just select a particular cell\nand then we can later drag\nthe property to other fields now here\nonce the cell is selected so for example\nlet's try this out and let's see if that\nworks so for example i will say peter\njohnson\nokay and that is basically five and\nnine and 12 characters so let's say\njunior\nand if i do this it says\ninput length is greater than 15 do you\nwant to continue if i say yes\nright so basically\nit is allowing me to add the value here\nbut then it has\nbasically violated the rule\nnow this is giving a message to the user\nthat the username should be entered\nless than 15 characters now how do we do\nthat\nso for this\nwe can basically\nselect the column and then we can search\nfor data tab and get into data\nvalidation so this is where you can\ncreate or select different kind of rules\nso for example i can go into data\nvalidation i can go into settings and i\ncan say the text length\nand that should be less than 15. now\nthis is the maximum i'm giving and it\nsays apply these changes to all other\ncells within the same settings\nso i can do this or i can just drag and\ndrop so i can basically\napply this formula and now you can in\nfact randomly check in any particular\ncell is the rule applied so it says text\nlength less than 15. so we can basically\ncontrol data validation in this\nparticular column and that will allow\nonly 15 characters\nit will pop up a message\nif the user really wants to go beyond\nthe particular limit\nnow you also have similarly date of\nbirth so the restriction is date of\nbirth should be between 10 jan 1990 to\n30 december 1998\nso this is what we want to restrict how\ndo we do that so we can select the field\nwe can click on data validation and if\nyou see here i have selected date\nand then date is between and then\nobviously you can give a range that is\n10 jan date\n1990\n12 30 1998 so that's the start and the\nend filter which has been applied\nand once this is done you can also check\nyour input messages which says\nwhen cell is selected show this input\nmessage enter a valid date\nso if you see here on the left there is\na pop-up which is coming up which says\nenter a valid date now i can also say\nwhen user enters invalid data show this\nerror alert so i can say stop\ni can say invalid\nentered\nand this is how i have set a rule so for\nexample if i just do\nsomething like this\nand that says invalidate entered i can\ndo a retry it will take me back here but\nunless and until\ni did not\ngive the right format the date will not\nbe accepted and again the same thing\napplies to all the cells\nsimilarly email so we are saying the\nemail should have at the rate present in\nthe value provided now for this we can\nuse a formula and we can select well i\nwould want to apply this rule to\nall these rows starting from c2 to c14\nso let's get into data validation\nlet's look in settings and here we are\nchoosing custom\nnow within custom i am choosing\nwhat is the formula so i am saying is\nnumber\nand then i'm saying find\nat the rate for\nthe rows c2 to c14 so the only thing we\nare concerned about here\nis the value should have an email\nicon\nyou can input a particular message you\ncan say what has to be done\nfor\nerror alert so for example we can\nbasically go in here and we can say\ninvalid email\nthat's the title i'm giving and we can\nsay\nemail\nshould\ncontain\nat the rate\nso if i do this and if i say okay now\nyou can test it so you can say a b c d\nand that says email should contain at\nthe rate and basically that will not\nallow me to add the values so now you\nhave the field called salary it says\nsalary should be greater than 50 000 now\nwe can limit the values by\nchoosing a whole number so for example\nfor salary i can go into data validation\ni can go into settings\nso here i can say something like\ndecimal or i can go for whole number so\nboth of the things are fine it depends\non what kind of values get into this\nparticular field so if i say whole\nnumber and if i say it has to be greater\nthan 50 000\nso i'm saying the minimum is 50 000 or i\ncould have given a decimal and then i\ncan say greater than\nless than equal or anything or even\nbetween so i can select it then and then\ni can just say okay\nnow for rank the rule is rank should be\nbetween 100 and 200 so again we can use\na whole number so ranks will\ngenerally not be decimal so this would\nbe whole number\nsalary is\ncan be a whole number or it could be\ndecimals so we have chosen decimal here\nand in rank if you click on data\nvalidation i have chosen whole number\ni've set data between 100 and 200\ninput message nothing error alert\nnothing but that depends i can give this\nso this is how you can just do a simple\ndata validation and control the values\nwhich land in the cell okay so now let's\nalso understand how we can\nrestrict the values in a particular cell\nwhich might be\nbased on a list of items\nnow for example here if you see i have\ntwo columns\nso one column basically has the values\nof city\nnames and then you have places within\nthat particular city so if i would want\nto implement a data validation based on\nthis so for example if you see here city\nand that basically shows me\nonly the four values which can be\nentered and if i go to place then it\ntells me for maharashtra i can only\nenter pune mumbai nasik now how do i do\nthis\nso say for example you take an empty\nfield and you want to restrict the\nvalues of city names so i could\nselect data validation i could basically\nselect list\nand then it tells me you need to enter\nthe list values that is the source so\nyou click here and then i can just\nselect these fields now if i do this and\nif i say okay\nit has implemented a data validation but\nif you look into this\nit will show me the same thing but then\nit shows me some empty cells\nwhich did not have any value so this is\nfine but it would be better if we\ndo it in a different way so i can select\nthis and i have already given my city\nnames here so i can just do a data\nvalidation\nand here in the source let me get rid of\nthis\nnow\ni can just\nhave my cursor here\ni can select these values and then if i\nsay okay so now if you see my city names\nhave been restricted to these values and\nthat's how you can implement your data\nvalidation\nso i have\nthis data validation here but i will get\nrid of this one by just doing a control\nz now i'll come here\nand say for example i would want to\nimplement the same data validation now\nthe easiest way would be\nin\ndoing this for all my four cities now if\nyou see here i have\ndata validation i could choose bangalore\nand if you come and check here there is\nno data validation but we have\nimplemented data validation here now how\nis that done so i could select this or\nfor example i can go in here i can\nselect data validation\ni can select list\nand then here in the source\ni will say for bangalore the value\nshould be these\nand then\nif i basically say okay\nnow\nif we see these are the values which are\nfed into bangalore\nso we could do this or like what we have\ndone here so if you can check the data\nvalidation rule\ni have used list and then i have said\nindirect\nf2 so basically i am giving in a formula\nwhich relates to the value which is in\nfor the city maharashtra so we could do\nthis or in a simpler way we could do\nthis and then just drag and drop here so\nwe could check for maharashtra what are\nthe values\nlet's choose a different city so for\nexample kolkata and here i will choose\nnow since we did a drag and drop it has\nbasically taken the values of bank load\nso that's not right so we select this we\ngo into data validation and here i can\neither\nfeed in the values that is such as\nbangalore i could basically say\nsomething like this kolkata\nand i could say okay so now if you see\nit shows me the places in kolkata\nnow here\nwe have let's choose a different city so\nfor example let's go for delhi and here\ni can go to data validation and i can\njust say delhi\nso this is an easier way of doing it or\nif you remember the formula\nthen what you can do is\nyou can just give in\nindirect\nand then basically\ngive the\nvalue of the cell\nfor which you would want to\nkeep in the values so this is how you\ncan do list validation so you can\nprovide a list of values and then you\ncan restrict the values in a cell\nwhich should be\nbelonging to a particular list\nso this is how you do a simple data\nvalidation by restricting the data in\nthe form of a list\nnow let's learn about pivot charts and\ntables which is one more very useful\nfeature of excel and which allows you to\nwork with your data or perform data\nanalysis\nnow pivot table is a summary of your\ndata\nit is used in cases where there are\nnumerous rows and columns in your data\nset\nand it allows you to group your data in\nseveral ways so that you can derive\nmeaningful information from it now the\nvisual representation of a pivot table\nis termed as a pivot chart now how do we\ndo that so let's see an example now here\nis some data here you see we have some\nrow labels\nwhich basically gives me some category\nof\nitems here\nit also tells me the sum of sales\nand basically it gives me per\nitem what is the total sum of sales\nwhich were made now how do i get this\nhere\nso for example if i would want to delete\nthis and i would be interested in\ngetting the\ntotal sales under each category of items\nnow we know that we have\ndifferent data here and it's huge for\nexample on the\nrow end if i just do a control and right\narrow it tells me what's my right last\ncolumn\nand if i just do a control and down\narrow it tells me there are\n9994 rows\nnow i can use this\nand what i can do is i can basically\nwork on\ninsert and go to pivot table now this\nbasically tells you need to choose the\nrange now since i have chosen my first\nrow and first column it basically has\nselected the data and that's fine now do\nyou want the result in a new worksheet\ni'll say existing worksheet and i can\nchoose a location now that basically\nneeds me to select a field might be we\ncan just select this field\nand that\nshould be good enough\nso\nfor example if i close this or if i say\nokay\nso\nthis is basically an indication that my\npivot table\nwill be created now what are the fields\nwe are interested in so as per the\nproblem we need to find out what the\ntotal sales for each category so let's\ngo in here and let's select the field\ncategory now as soon as you do that it\nshows that the rows which are\nbeing selected are for this column\ncategory and now we are interested in\ngetting the sales so we would want the\nsales per category so let's select this\nso you see some of sales is selected now\nclose this and that's it that's that's\nyour data so it shows you row labels it\ntells you what are the different\ncategories\nand it also gives you\nsum of sales which is per category now\nthis is\none easy example where we have solved\nthe problem where we have tried to find\nwhat were the total sales under each\ncategory of items so for example let's\nhave\nanother data set so\nagain\nyou can just check how many rows we have\nand it is basically the same 9994\nand if i look in columns it basically\nshows me profit is the last column\nand\nhere\nwe would want to find out\nwhich category\nso for example let me get rid this with\nsubcategory of items sold the maximum\nunder each category so\nwe have some categories here which says\nfurniture and it shows some sub\ncategories\nand then it shows me office supplies and\nthen some sub categories and same thing\nwith technology now we know how we got\nthis data but this is different than\nwhat we were seeing here so here we were\njust getting the categories but but we\ndid not have any breakdown\nof sub categories within this particular\ncategory and here you see there is a\nbreakdown and then basically you can\nalso apply a filter which basically says\nwhat is the data you want and if you are\ninterested in finding out a particular\nvalue now how do we do this so for\nexample let me get rid of this\nnow we know how we can find out the\ncategory of items but we would want to\nfind out which sub category of items\nsold the maximum under each category so\nhere we are not looking at sales but we\nare looking at the quantity\nokay\nso what we can do is we can go to the\nfirst row and first column click on\ninsert click on pivot table data is\nalready selected let's choose existing\nworksheet let's choose a location in our\nworksheet where we would want to have\nthis\nso might be i can select this particular\nfield and then just close this\nso it says\nthis is the existing worksheet say ok\nand now you need to select your\ncolumns\nso for example\nif\ni would want the data for categories so\ni can select this now i know that within\ncategory these are the options which we\nhave and then there is a sub category so\nlet's select that and if you see here\nnow we have the data which will be\nfiltered so based on your category and\nsubcategory\nand then we will choose quantity so it\nautomatically understands that this is\nsomething on which\nsummation can be done so let's select\nthis and close on this now if you see\nhere we have got our items\nwhere we can see\nthe sub categories within a particular\ncategory now i can basically close this\nand that just shows me\nhigh level categories here so here\ni can again\nselect a particular\nrow and column i can go for\neither a new pivot table so we could\nbasically select this the row is already\nselected\nexisting worksheet is what i want so now\ni will select\nthis particular place\nsay okay now we do the same thing like\nwhat we did earlier\nso we will select category subcategory\nand quantity so the data is already\ncoming\njust select this and now you already\nhave all your data but this is not what\nwe want we want to\nbasically apply a filter\nto this now how do we do that so we can\ngo for\nslicer so i can go for insert slicer and\nthen it tells what are\nthe sub categories which you are\ninterested in so for example\nif i go for something like\nsub category and say okay\nso this tells me\nwhat are the categories you are\ninterested in so for example we know\nthat furniture has furnishings with the\nhighest value\nso i can select say furnishings\nand then\ni was interested in office supplies\nso within office supply i can basically\nsearch for\nhere\nbinder so i can just do a control and\nselect binder\nand then i can also know for technology\ni can select phones so i'll say control\nand select phones and now if you see the\nfilter has been applied\nand we have these sub categories which\nare selected so we have our data here\nnow we don't need really this so i can\njust delete this and i have my data\nwhich shows me\nfurniture being the main category and\nthat has only furnishings office supply\nhaving binders and technology having\nphones and that basically\nis a filter applied on the result of\nyour pivot so this is how we are seeing\nwhich subcategory of items\nwere sold\nmaximum for each category\nso this is how you can easily use pivot\ntables and you can do some analysis\nlet's look at some more examples\nnow\nlet's see if you have to answer this\nquestion which says which were the top\nthree states for each region\nthat made the highest average profit\nnow how do we calculate that\nso for example this is the data we have\nand as i have instructed earlier you can\nselect the first row and first column\nyou can click on insert go into pivot\ntable\nand that basically selects all your data\nwe will choose the result should be in\nthis existing worksheet so select this\nclick here\nand then basically let's select\nthis cell\nand\ni will say okay so now my pivot table\nwill be here so we are interested in\nfinding out top three states within each\nregion which have made the highest\nprofit or which have made the highest\naverage profit so for that first we will\nselect\nregion so when we select region it shows\nhere region and within region you will\nthen select state\nso\nwithin every region you have multiple\nstates so that's what we are selecting\nand then we are interested in looking at\nthe profit so let's select profit and\nthat automatically shows up here\nso we can now say close this\nso basically we have all the data but we\nare looking at the sum of profit but\nthat's not what we want\nwe are looking for\ntop three states\nfrom each region that made the highest\naverage profit\nnow how do we change that so here we\nhave sum of profit so i can do a right\nclick\nand basically i can say summarize values\nby average\nso now i'm getting the average here and\nthat basically tells per region\ni have the average profit\nbut first is let's sort this data so\nlet's go into sort more options and here\ni have average of profit\nor for example as i said you can select\nregion say okay\nand now it is basically having the\nregions\nand then you have your state value so\nagain we can do a\nsorting here and i can say\nlet's go for more sort options i'll say\ndescending\nthe state values should be based on\naverage profit\nso let's say okay and now if you see\nin particular region we have\nthe data which has been\nsorted\nwherein you have the highest average\nprofit on the top\nnow what we can also do is we can\nbasically\nthen go for filtering we can say top 10\nbut i am not interested in top 10 so i\ncould reduce this to top three\nand this is the items average of profit\nsay okay and now you see per region\nyou have\nthe data which is\nshowing me top three states what are the\naverage\nand then you are also looking at the\nsubtotal so which basically says average\nprofit for your west now if you would\nwant to arrange this\nyour west and south and east and central\nin a particular alphabetical order if\nyou would want to sort it you can always\ndo a sorting and you can choose sort z\nto a\nif that's what you would want to do or\nyou can go for\nsorting\nmore sort options\nand you want to\nsort the region which is as of now\nbased on descending z2a let's make it\nascending say okay\nand now you see the data has been\nfiltered so it says per region\nnow you can always select this and you\ncan say what is this so this is\nbasically your average of profit now\nwe are looking at\neach region and the states the top three\nstates as we wanted\nwithin the region and what is the\naverage\nnow we have one more question what is\nthe percentage contribution of each sub\ncategory of products under each category\nto the total sales so we know there are\ndifferent products\nthere are different categories and\nall the categories contribute to the\ntotal sales so we would want to find out\nwhat is the percentage contribution of\neach subcategory\nof products\nunder each category so we not only want\nthe\ncategory percentage but we would also\nwant what is the contribution of each\nsub category\nto\neach category to the total sales how do\nwe do that so for that we need to again\njust place\nour cursor here or select the first row\nand first column click on your insert\nclick on your pivot table and now the\ndata is already selected existing\nworksheet\nplace your cursor here\nand then let's select this\ncell say okay\nnow your pivot table fields are here so\nwe are interested in category\nso let's select category\nand then within a category we will have\nsub categories and we are interested in\nthe sales data\nwherein it is already going to give us\nthe sum of sales but we would want this\nin the form of percentage rather than\njust the sum\nnow we can click here value field\nsettings and it says if you would want\nto summarize this it says show value as\nand\nwhat are the values you would want so\nyou can straight away go ahead here and\nsay percentage of grand total so we\ncould do that because we know\nwe will get a sum of sales and grand\ntotal now i could basically say\nthe percentage of grand total say okay\nand then\njust close this\nso once you have closed this you see\nalready the data is in\npercentage\nso now we have our data with\nsubcategories but we also want the data\nto be sorted might be in a descending\norder which tells which subcategory is\ncontributing more than others we can\nselect how many sub categories we are\ninterested in so we can basically select\none of the sub category cells\nright click now you have option filter\nand you have sorting so we can say more\nsort options\nnow here i will say descending and\nyou want the descending to be sum of\nsales which is already showing as\npercentage\nclick on ok and now you see for each\ncategory\nit shows the percentage contribution\ntowards the sales\nit shows the sub categories contribution\nto a particular category and also to\ntotal sales\nso\ntechnically speaking if you look at all\nthese values which are sub categories\nand if you total them that would be your\ntotal grand total so this is how we can\nsolve a simple problem like this what is\nthe percentage contribution of each sub\ncategory of products under\neach category to the total sales\nthe next question is which customer made\nthe lowest profit in the home office\nsegment in each state now here we know\nthat we are looking for\nhome office segment\nwe are looking for customer which made\nthe lowest profit\nwe are also looking for the state\nas the main\ncriteria so\nin each state\nwe would look for home office segment\nand within that we would look for\ncustomer which has made the lowest\nprofit that means\nthe lowest value\nof the profit so how do we do this so\nlet's say let's get into\nselecting our row and column we will go\ninto insert i'll say pivot table\ni'll say existing worksheet\nand let me get my result here so let's\nsay okay now that gives me the pivot\ntable so the first thing is we are\nlooking at\nper\nstate\nand\ni would be interested in\nhome office segment or i could first\nstart with segment\nnow here we have segment and in segment\ni can basically select home office so i\ncan just do a uncheck and select home\noffice only\nand now i can select\nstate\nso that will be my\nsub category within segment and then\nwithin state\nwe would want to find out the customer\nso let's get the customer name\nand we are interested in finding out the\nlowest profit so let's select profit\nand here we have sum of profits so the\nfields are selected close this\nand now you have your data\nwhich basically shows me\nthe names of customers which made the\nprofit but it's\nit's not sorted so we can sort this\nand we have state entries also so that's\nfine so what i can do is here\ni can basically say sorting go to more\nsort options i can say i want to do a\ndescending or i want to do an ascending\nand ascending based on\nsum of profit so let's do that now you\nsee\nthe top most value is the lowest value\nper state\nwithin home office segment now what we\nalso want is we just want one value per\nstate\nso how do we do that so we can just\ngo for filtering go for top 10 values i\nam interested in bottom value and in\nthat also\ni am looking for only the\nlowest value so let's select one\nsay okay and now you see we have data\nfor home office segment\nper\nstate customer who has made the lowest\nprofit\nso we have easily answered this question\nusing our pivot table\nnow say for example we have a question\nwhich says find the sales made in each\nquarter of 2016 for all the regions\nso the data has to be divided quarterly\nand use order year as a slicer we can do\nthat by selecting what data we would\nwant to slice and then we would want to\ncreate a pivot chart also so for example\nhow do we do that\nso for example\ni will get rid of this\ni will get rid of\nthis my pivot chart which we can\nrecreate so find the sales made in each\nquarter\nof 2016 for all the regions\nso this is what we want\nnow how do we do this\nso for example let's select this\nwe will do a insert pivot table we will\nbasically say existing worksheet\nand then i can select this particular\ncell i'll say ok\nand now\ni am interested in data quarterly so\nfirst let's select\nour field here so we should basically\nhave\nif all our fields are selected say for\nexample if i say order date\nnow\nyou see we have quarters and years which\nare selected\nnow we could be selecting these fields\nwhich says\nquarters years\nand if i would want data to be filtered\nbased on years i could do that or i\ncould get rid of here so i have quarters\ni have order date\nso\nthat's being already selected now what\nelse we need we need to find out\nfor every region so let's select the\nregion\nand we can also add region as a column\nhere so that will basically give me all\nthe regions\nas different columns and then finally we\nwant the sales so let's select this\nand now\nlet's look what we have\nso if you see here\nwe have our data\nwhich is\nfor each quarter\nit gives me the total data but what we\nwould be interested in is not looking at\nthe total data but we are only\ninterested in quarter of\n2016. now how do we do that so what we\ndo here is we have row labels so let's\nclick on this so we have date filters\nand then in date filters we can go for\nbetween and then we will say\n2016\nand the value has to be 1\nand then let's select this\nand let's change this to 2016\nand\nthis is 12th month\nand then we can say 31.\nso we are saying the date has to be 2016\nand it basically says\nnot a valid date\nso let's select\nlet's select a particular date and see\nso the month has to be here\nso let's see in this and let's make it\ndate\nand say okay\nand now we have our data which is\nfor\n2016.\nso for example i could basically select\nthis\nand here i could be\nlooking at\nwhat are the filters we have so it says\nclear filter from order data\nso we have applied the filter on order\ndate\nand\nthese are your date filters which is\nbasically\ndate\n16 oh this is wrong so this one has to\nbe changed to 2016.\nso select this and now we have our data\nfor\n2016.\nso we have found the sales made in each\nquarter of 2016 for all the regions the\ngrand total\nfor a particular quarter if we are\nlooking at the value\nor for individual months in a particular\nquarter\nand we have sliced the data now we could\nhave also\nintroduced a slicer by selecting\nwhich field we would want to implement\nso for example if i would select a\nparticular field and then i could click\non slicer i could choose i would want to\nslice the date based on order date and\nthen could have done it or we have just\ngiven the\ndate for 2016. now we just need to\nplot a graph for this and that's very\neasy so you just need to select\nthe complete pivot data and here you\nhave the chart options so let's go for\nline chart\nand that basically shows me the line\nchart so we can select this\nwe can just drag and drop it here\nand then\nwe can basically check if that is\nshowing us the data so if you see here\nthis is line chart where it has divided\nthe regions in different colors\nso we have all the regions we could\nfilter out in pivot chart a particular\nregion\nwe have\nthe quarterly\ntime here in order data the filter is\napplied it says it is 2016.\nin quarters it tells me it is 16. so we\nhave our data we have created a pivot\nchart\nand basically we have sliced the data\nfor\n2016.\nlet's answer one more question and\nthat's finding the profit made in each\nyear\nfor all the categories of products\nin east and west regions only and then\nwe would want to create a histogram for\nthe same pivot table so histogram\nusually gives us the frequencies so\nlet's look at how do we calculate the\nprofit made in each year for all the\ncategories so what i can do is\ni can basically\nselect my\nrow id here and now i'll do a pivot\ntable\nso the data is already selected i'll\nchoose existing worksheet let's select\nthis particular cell say okay\nnow what are we interested in now if you\nlook at the fields we don't see any\nyears or quarters and so on so for\nexample here i can just choose order\ndate\nand then basically\ni can choose say for example\nyears or quarters\nthe data which is coming out from my\norder date so here i will just select\nyears now\nthen i have my order date\nso\nwe are interested in the years\norders\nand\nwe are interested in let's look at our\ncolumn or the question what we had here\nso we have years\nfind the profit made in each year so\nlet's select\nprofit so that basically says sum of\nprofit\nbut then\ni'm on also interested in\nfor all the categories of products so\nwhat i can do is here\ni have my field which is category and\nthat i'll add to the columns so that\nshows me what are the different\ncategories\nand this looks fine now i'm also\ninterested in east and west regions so\nthat is basically in the region so\neither we could add a slicer or we could\ndo a filtering here by adding the\nfilters so first is i'll click on region\nand here it says select all i'm only\ninterested in east and west so let's\nselect this\ntake this\nput it here\nlet's say okay and now\nwe have the data which has been filtered\nbased on the region so here we have\nregion so you can always look at the\nfilter it is east and west\nand we have\nour year data\nper year we have\ndifferent categories you can always look\nat what are these column labels so this\nis my different categories\nand this is the profit per category\nand then you have your grand total so we\nhave already our data now let's say\nclose this\nso we have our data for all these years\ndifferent categories the profits made\nper year\nand if i would want i could go into an\nyear and i could look into different\nmonths so that also\nis showing up and now we would want to\nbasically plot a histogram with this\ndata so i can just\nplace my cursor here i can select this\nand then i can go into insert and here i\nhave different options so we can go for\nbar chart\nwe can go for insert hierarchy chart\nwe can go into waterfall funnel stock\nsurface or radar chart so there are\ndifferent options what you have here and\nwe will go for a simple histogram which\nis two dimensional let's select this\nand here you see you can obviously\nselect different regions\nyou have your years which shows up\nyou have your order date\nand then you have your categories which\ncan be chosen for your histogram or for\nyour bar chart and that basically is how\nyou use your pivot table you use some\ncalculations and then you can plot your\nneeded graph to visualize the data and\nunderstand it in a better way so what is\nexcel power query\npower query is an advanced feature of\nmicrosoft excel that allows you to\nprepare your data for analysis\nyou can perform numerous text\ncomputations and numerical analysis to\nmake your data more powerful and\ninformative excel power query is a data\npreparation and transformation engine it\nallows you to carry out the extract\ntransform and load operations on the\ndata sets from multiple sources\nnow\nlet's look at the challenges solved by\npower query\nearlier in excel there was difficulty in\ndata connections\nnow using power query you can connect to\na broad range of data sources such as\nrelational databases web files text csv\njson files and even fetch data in the\ncloud\nvolume variety and velocity are the\ncharacteristics that define big data it\nwas a major problem to handle such data\nnow power query enables you to transform\nyour data to an appropriate size it also\nallows you to work on any shape of data\nfrom any source\nearlier updating your data and\nrefreshing it in real time was an issue\nusing power query a reputable process\nquery is adopted to update the data in\nreal time and in the future\nin excel\nit was not so easy to reshape transform\nand manipulate data\nbut using power query provides a highly\ninteractive experience and sophisticated\ntools to prepare your data now\nfrom excel 2016 onwards power query on\nwindows has been fully integrated into\nexcel\nbut in excel 2010 and 2013 for windows\npower query is a free add-in\nyou can go ahead and download the link\nonce installed\nthe power query tab will be visible in\nthe excel ribbon now coming to the\nfeatures of power query so excel power\nquery allows you to clean transform\nmanipulate and process your data for\nanalysis it helps you to automate\nrepetitive tasks that you want to do it\nover and over again you can search for\ndata sources and make connections as and\nwhen you want power query helps you to\nprepare and shape the data in the right\nformat for performing analysis\nand finally\nonce your data is ready you can share\nyour findings or use your query to\ncreate interactive reports and\ndashboards\nnow let's have a glance at the demo that\nwe are going to work on in this video\nso we look at how to load data from\ndifferent sources\nyou will understand how to extract\ntables from web files so we'll extract\ntables present on wikipedia pages\nthen you learn how to sort and filter\ndata\nup next you'll see how to group your\ndata how to split a column into multiple\ncolumns\nand then pivot and unpivot your\ntable\nthen you are going to work on\ndate columns and make some\ntransformations\nunderstand how to append tables and\nmerge tables vertically and horizontally\nnow let's open ms excel and start with\nimporting a simple text file\nso you can see here i have my excel file\nopened\nand in the middle you can see i have my\nemployee txt file\nnow this is a comma separated file\nmeaning that the values are separated by\ncommas as you can see it here\nthe columns have been separated by\ncommas and all the values have a comma\nbetween them\nnow\nthis\ntext file has information about\nthe name age company and the city to\nwhich the employee belongs to\nlet's see how easily you can import this\nemp text file into ms excel\nhere\ni am using\nexcel 365 or office 365 where power\nquery on windows has been fully\nintegrated into this version of excel\nso what i'll do is first let's go to the\ndata tab\nand\nyou have this section called get and\ntransform data so i'll click on get data\nunder get data i'll go to from file\nand select\nfrom text slash csv\nonce i click on it it will ask me to\ngive the location where the file is\nthere\nso my file is on desktop i'll click on\npower query files and here you can see i\nhave my employee txt file\nyou can see the type here it says text\ndocument\nclick on emp\nand hit import\nnow this will take some time to import\nthe file onto excel\nit's establishing a connection you can\nsee\nthere you go\nso here you can see the filename emp.txt\nyou can see the file origin\nas i said the delimiter is comma and we\nhave the data type detection\nand here you can see\nwe have our text file\nso excel power query feature has\nautomatically detected the column names\nso we have name\nage company and city as our columns and\nthese are the values\nnow let's hit load\nso this will load all the rows and the\ncolumns onto excel\nthere you go it was really quick\nexcel has automatically loaded our text\nfile\nnow you can see here we have another tab\ncalled queries and connections so we\nhave made\none query and have loaded\nthe employee data it gives a preview\nalso you can see it here\nand if needed later you can go to edit\nand change some values that we'll see\nlater\nnow you can use this data to create\nsimple visualizations\nso let me show you how to do it\nso let's first select the data and\nwe'll go to the insert tab\nunder insert tab i'll click on\nrecommended charts\nlet's say i want to know how many\nemployees belong to a particular city\nso i'll click on the second chart which\nsays the count of name by city\nand i'll click on ok\nhere you can see\nwe have a nice clustered bar chart\nand you can see\nin bangalore there were\nfive employees in hyderabad we had two\nand in nasik we had one\nyou can see the count here this is a\npivot table\nif you go back to our actual data here\nyou can see\nin bangalore we had vidya sonam avinash\nzvarun and himani\nand there were two more people from\nhyderabad and one from nasik\nso you can use the excel power query\nfeature to import data onto excel and\nmake some visualizations\nnow\nif you want to fetch some data that is\npresent on the web or on the internet\nexcel power query features and\nfunctionalities can help you import\nthose data as well\nwe will now see how to import data\nspecifically a table that is present on\nthe web\nhere i'll be using a wikipedia article\non the list of european cup and ufo\nchampions league finals let me show you\nthe page first\nso this is my wikipedia page on the list\nof european cup and ufo champions league\nfinals if i scroll down you can see all\nthe details here\nand i would like to import\nthis table\nwhich has the list of\nall the finals so we have columns like\nseason winners score line runner sub\nvenue and attendance\nlet's import this table on to excel\nso i'll copy this url first\nnow let me open a new sheet i'll go to\nsheet 1\nand then on the data tab\nunder the get data section\ni'll go to from other sources and here i\nhave\nfrom web which allows me to import data\nfrom the web either you can follow this\npath or\nif you see here\nthere's an option to get data from the\nweb if i click on this\nit is asking me to enter the url so i'll\npaste the url of the wikipedia page here\nand let's click on ok\nnow it's navigating and\nokay\nyou can see\npower query feature in excel has given\nus a list of tables which you can see\nhere we have something called as\ndocument\nthere's a key table and here you can see\nthere's one table which is extracted\nfrom the\nwikipedia page\nand the table which i am interested in\nis this table which has the list of\neuropean cup\nfinals\nyou can see it here\nexcel power query feature has\nautomatically detected\nthese rows and it has given a\nlist of columns as well you can see\nthese are the columns\ni will explore the transform data tab\npresent in the\npower query\nnow if i click on transform data it will\ntake me to the power query editor\nlet me just\nclick on refresh\nnow this is the most important section\nusing the power query editor you can\nclean your data filter your data\nmanipulate your data\nand make it ready for analysis\nnow let's explore a few tabs available\nhere so we have a home tab that has\na query section\nyou can see you can reduce rows manage\ncolumns sort the data transform the data\ncombine different tables\nnow there's another tab called transform\nwhich allows you to select your data\ntype transpose your rows and columns\npivot and unpivot your columns\nand here you can see\nyou can find out some summary statistics\nand you can manage your date values as\nwell\nnow if you want to add some new columns\nto your data you can do that as well and\nyou also have a view tab\nnow here\nif you see the first two rows\nthe values are the same you can see\nseason season these are all repeated\nwhich we actually don't need\nand these are pretty similar to our\ncolumn names\nsimilarly if i scroll down\nyou see there are some\nrows\nwhich have null values\nso actually these\nrows do not add up any value or do not\nadd any value to our data so we'll clean\nthis data\nfirst so let's see how to do it\nnow if you want to remove certain rows\nin the table\nwhat you can do is\ngo to the home tab\nand under reduce rows click on remove\nrows and then choose\nremove top rows\nif i select remove top rows it will ask\nme how many rows do you want to remove\nfrom the top\nyou can see it here\ni'll give i want to remove the top two\nrows\nnow let's click on ok\nyou will see\nthat\nthe excel power query editor has removed\nthe first two rows\nand on the right you can see the steps\nthat were applied\nyou can see it here\npreviously we had these two\nrows which were redundant\nand once we applied the step\nit has removed the first two rows\nsimilarly\nlet's go down and remove the last\none two three four five so we are going\nto remove the last\nseven rows from the table\nso again\ni'll go to reduce rows and click on\nremove rows now this time i'll select\nremove bottom rows\nand here i'll choose\ni want to delete seven rows from the\ntable\nfrom the bottom\ni click on ok if you see\nthe last seven rows have been deleted\nnow let me show you the last row which\nis this one\nso the last season of\nufo champions league was held in 2020\nwhich is this year\nand bayern munich won the champions\nleague against\na french team that was paris\nsaint-germain by a score of 1-0\nnow if you see the last value that is\nthe attendance\nyou can see the value is 0 which means\nthere were no spectators in the stadium\nit was because of the covet conditions\nnow let's do some more manipulation to\nour data\nsuppose this time i want to add a new\ncolumn let's say a stadium name by\nextracting values from the venue column\nso let me just show you the venue column\nso this is our venue column\nso the first value\nis the stadium name\nthen we have the city in which the\nstadium is there\nand finally we have the\ncountry name\nso i want to extract only the stadium\nname so you can see we have some\nstadiums like santiago bernabeu\nthere's wembley san siro\nand other stadiums so i want to extract\nonly the stadium names\nso let's see how to do that\ni'll click on the venue column and go to\nadd column tab\nunder add column here you can see we\nhave\nextract\nif i click on this drop down there is an\noption to select\ntext before delimiter\nso if i choose text before delimiter\nhere\ni'll give my delimiter as\ncomma\nso everything before the first comma\nwill be considered as the stadium name\nnow let me click on ok\nnow here you can see under applied steps\nit says inserted\ntext before delimiter if i scroll to the\nright you can see the last column\nhas a stadium names\nlet me double click on this and change\nthis to\nstadium name column\nand hit enter\neven this step is applied\nhere you can see renamed columns\nsimilarly\nlet's explore a few more features\nnow i want to add a new column called\nstadium city\nso\nif you consider this venue column\nwhatever is there between the two commas\nis the stadium city\nso for example santiago bernabau is in\nmadrid similarly\nwembley stadium is in london\nsan siro is in milan\nso these\nmiddle values i want to extract into a\nnew column called as stadium city\nso let's see how to do it\nso i'll click on the venue column\nand go to extract\nand again\ni'll select\nthe extract tab\nand here now i'll choose\ntext between delimiters\nand my first delimiter i'll give is a\ncomma\nand a space\nyou can see here\nall the values\nhave a comma and a space\nand my end delimiter will be another\ncomma\nthen i'll click on ok\nthis will add a new column\nto the extreme right of the table you\ncan see here we have text between\ndelimiters\nand it has extracted the stadium city\nlet me go ahead and\nrename this\ncolumn as\nstadium\ncity\nand hit enter\nyou can see the applied step here\nnow\ni want to split the score column into\ntwo columns so here we have the score\ncolumn\nand\nthe left value presents the number of\ngoals that were scored by the winning\nteam\nand the right value presents the number\nof\ngoals that were scored by the losing\nteam\nso here i'll split the column into two\ncolumns as winner score and loser score\nso what i'll do is\nselect this column and go to the home\ntab\nunder the home tab we have\nsplit column\ni'll select split column\nand then choose\nbyte delimiter\nso automatically\nexcel power query detects that this dash\nis my delimiter\nand i'll split at each occurrence of the\ndelimiter\nlet's click on ok\nnow you can see\nthe score column has been split into two\nit has renamed the column as score dot 1\nand score dot 2.\nwhat i'll do is i'll go ahead and\nwe'll rename this column as winner score\nand this will\nrename it to\nloser score\ni'll hit enter\nand i have renamed it successfully\nnext\nlet's change the winners team and the\nrunner sub team values to uppercase\nso suppose\ni want to change all the values or the\nclub names of the winners team to\nuppercase so what i can do is\ni'll select this column and go to the\ntransform tab\nunder transform tab i have this option\ncalled\nformat\nso here\ni'll click on format and then\nyou can see\ni can change the case to lowercase\nuppercase capitalize each word\nso here i want to make all the winner\nteams as uppercase i'll select uppercase\nthere you go\nwe have successfully converted all the\nwinner team names to uppercase\nsimilarly let's do it for the runner sub\nteam as well\nso here i have my runnersup team\ni'll go to the transform tab\nclick on format\nand select upper case\nnow we saw\nhow to do some simple\nmanipulation of our data so we created a\nfew columns split a few columns\nnow to save all this i have to go to the\nhome tab and then click on\nclose and load\nthis will take some time and load our\ndata onto this excel sheet\nyou can see here it's loading the data\nthis will take a bit of time\nthere you go\nexcel power query feature has\nsuccessfully\nperformed some manipulations on our data\nsome calculations on our data and then\nit has\nsaved the final version\nand loaded it onto excel now using this\nclean data we can do some analysis\nlet's say i want to find the seasons in\nwhich the winners team scored more than\nthree goals so we have a problem\nstatement at hand we want to find the\nseasons in which\nthe winner team had more than three\ngoals scored\nso what you can do is\nselect any\ncell in this data and go to the insert\ntab and click on\npivot table\nhere i'll click on existing worksheet\nand then\ni'll give my location\ni'll place my\npivot table somewhere here and click on\nok\nall right now\nsince i want to know the seasons i'll\ndrag season on to row\nand i'll also drag\nthe winner's team\ncolumn on to rows\nthen i'll choose my winner score\nunder values\nhere you can see we have the pivot table\nready\nnow we need to filter this table to see\nall the winning teams that scored more\nthan three goals so what i'll do is\ni'll select this winner score column and\nplace it under filters\nand here you can see i have my filter\nlet me click on this drop down\nand i'll select multiple items\nfrom this multiple items i'll choose\n4 5 and 7 because these values are\ngreater than 3\nand click on ok\nhere you can see i have filtered my\npivot table\nand to the left you can see the season\nand the winner team\nthat had scored more than three goals in\nthe finals\nall right\nsimilarly\nyou can perform some more analysis\nsuppose\ni want to know how many times real\nmadrid won the championship\nso let's see\ni'll click on one cell in the data set\ngo to the insert tab and click on pivot\ntable\ni'll choose existing worksheet and give\nmy location here\nlet's say i want to place my port table\nhere\nclick on ok\nalright so the question we have is how\nmany times have real madrid won the\nchampionship so i'll choose\nthe winners team column and place it\nunder\nrows\nand\nlet's say\nwe'll select the winner score as well\nand let's convert this winner score from\nsum\nto let's say count and click on ok\nand\nsince i want to check only for\nreal madrid\nso what i'll do is i'll go to\nthe insert tab\nand i'll insert a slicer\nhere i'll choose\nwinner teams as my slicer and click on\nok\nand out of this\ni want to choose only\nreal madrid so i'll select real madrid\nyou can see it here\nreal madrid have won the championship 13\ntimes\nokay\nlet's say you want to compress your data\nand remove unnecessary columns without\nlosing any information you can do that\nusing a feature in the power query\neditor called unpivot to perform this\ntask we'll use a census data of india\nfrom wikipedia so let me first show you\nthe wikipedia page\nso this is my wikipedia article which\nsays list of states in india by past\npopulation\nand if i scroll down\nyou can see it here there's a table\nwhich says by past population from 1947\nto 2011.\nso there are a few columns like rank\nthis state or union territory and we\nhave population starting from 1951 till\n2011 which was our last census\nhere you can see if i scroll further\nthere are\nnearly 29 states and we have\nseven union territories so we will\nextract this table and load into excel\nfirst\nokay so let me click on a new sheet\nand we'll follow the same drill i'll go\nto my data tab\nand click on get data\nunder get data i'll go to from other\nsources and click on from web\nhere it will ask me to provide the url\nlink of the wikipedia page so i'll paste\nthe url here\nand click on ok\nnow once i have done that\nit will load a few tables\nonto excel you can see there are a few\ntables here i'll click on the first one\nso we have our table here now let's do\nsome transformation to this data\nthis opens in the power query editor\nokay i'll click on refresh first\nthis will take some time to refresh the\nentire data okay we are done now if you\nsee this data\nclearly\nthe first\nrow in this table is not necessary at\nall because these are our column names\nso we also have our column headers\nalready present\nso let's go ahead and delete the first\nrow so we'll go to the home tab under\nremove rows i'll click on remove top\nrows\nnow i'll give my\nnumber of rows as one so we want to\nremove the first row only i click on ok\nyou can see the first row has been\ndeleted\nif i scroll further\ni actually don't need the last row as\nwell which is the total\nso what we can do is we can also remove\nthe last row from the bottom\nso i'll\nselect one\nclick on ok\nyou can see the step has been applied\nand\nyou don't see the last row that was the\ntotal row anymore\nso the task that i want to do here is\ni want to compress\nall these columns which are basically\nthe population columns\nso i'll\nselect my\nstate or union territory column\nand\ngo to the transform tab and here i have\nthe option to unpivot columns so i'll\nclick on this drop down and select\nunpivot other columns\nyou can see here the step has been\napplied\nand\nall the population column from 1951 till\n2011 have been unpivoted\nif you want you can go ahead and\nrename these columns let's see i'll\nwrite it as population column\nand\nlet's say this is\ni'll rename it to total population value\nall right\nnow we are done with our preparation of\ndata let's go to the home tab and click\non close and load\nnow this will take some time to load the\ndata onto excel\nall right so we have\nour census data here so first you can\nsee\nrank one is uttar pradesh and we have\nthe population starting from 1951 till\n2011.\nthen we have for maharashtra\nif i scroll down you can see the other\nstates we have tamil nadu rajasthan this\nkarnataka if i scroll further\nwe have odisha this telangana kerala now\nif you see here\nthe population values from 1951 till\n2011 for the telangana state are all n a\nwhich means there was no data available\nnow this is because telangana was only\nformed in 2014 so there was no census\nfor this state\nlet's continue with our demo and let's\nexplore a few more\nfeatures and functionalities of our\nquery editor\nnow the next table we are going to use\nis an adventure works customer table\nnow this data set is provided by\nmicrosoft for practitioners who want to\nlearn power bi excel or similar\ntechnologies and want to do some\nmanipulation some calculation some data\nanalysis stuff\nso let me go to a new sheet and let's\nimport\nthe adventure works customer data set\nit's a csv file onto excel first\nso i'll go to my data tab\nand click on get data from here i'll go\nto\nprompt file and choose\nfrom text slash\ncsv you can see it here in my power\nquery files folder i have my\nadventure works customer table\ni'll select this and click on import\nthis will take some time to load the\ndata set\nyou can see the review of the data set\nhere so we have\ncolumns like the customer key we have\nthe prefix of the customer name the\nfirst name the last name of the customer\ndate of birth\nmarital status\nif i go to the right we have annual\nincome total children education level\noccupation and homeowner column as well\nso let's click on transform data\nhere we'll learn a few more\nfeatures of power query\nokay we have our data on our power query\neditor\nso first what i'll show you is\nlet's change the prefix column the first\nname column and the last name column to\nproper case\nso you can see it here the prefix first\nname and last name columns are all\nin upper case\nnow if you want to change the values to\nproper case\njust\nhit control and select the three columns\nand\ngo to the transform tab\nunder transform tab you have\nformat\nso click on format here you can see we\nhave lowercase uppercase now proper case\nis to capitalize each word so i'll click\non capitalize each word\nyou can see it here now\nwe have converted the prefix first name\nand last name column\ninto prop case\nthe next step i'm going to show you is\nlet's merge\nall the three columns the prefix column\nthe first name column and the last name\ncolumn into one full name column\nso\nwhat i'll do is i'll select the three\ncolumns\nand then let's go to add column\nand under add column we have this option\ncalled merge columns\nlet's hit merge columns\nok\nnow it's asking you to give the\nseparator i'll select my separator as a\nspace\nand click on ok\nok so before click on ok i want to\nchange my\nnew column name from merged to let's say\nfull name\nand now let's click on\nok you can see here it says inserted\nmerged column and if i go to my\nright\nyou can see it here we have a full name\ncolumn\nnow if you want\nto shift the location of the full name\ncolumn you can do that as well\njust\nhold this and\nkeep on dragging to the left\nthis will move the entire\ntable to the right and you can place it\nwherever you want so i want to place it\nlet's say here\nokay\nnow actually i don't want all these\ncolumns so let's delete it\nso click on this\nand\ni'll right click\nand click on remove\nyou can see we have removed the prefix\ncolumn similarly let's remove the\nother two columns you can either right\nclick and do or go to the home tab\nand then select remove columns\nall right\nnow\nlet's say we want to add a domain name\ncolumn from aws customers by extracting\nthe characters between at the rate and\ndot com so actually i am talking about\nthe email address\nfrom this email address we want to\ncreate a new column called as domain\nname for that we'll extract characters\nthat are present between addderate and\ndot com so let's see how to do it\ni'll select the email address column\nand then i'll go to add column\nunder add column i'll click on extract\nand this time we want to extract\nbetween two delimiters and so i'll\nselect\ntext between delimiters and i'll give my\nstarting delimiter as\nadd the rate\nand\nmy end delimiter would be dot com\nnow let's click on ok\nso this will\ninsert a new column to the extreme right\nyou can see we have our domain name\nlet's go ahead and\nchange the column name to domain name\nand hit enter\nall right\nyou can see the step has been applied\nnow we are done with\nour preparation of customers table let's\njust go to the home tab and click on\nclose and load\nso all the transformation that we did in\nthe power query editor\nwill reflect here so you can see we have\nour full name column\nand if you see\nwe have our domain name as well\nokay\nnow using the power query editor you can\nperform some\nstatistical analysis\nnow let's explore those statistical\nfeatures\nfor this we'll be using another data set\ncalled adventure box product data set\nagain this data set is also provided by\nmicrosoft\nso let's go to the new sheet and here\ni'll go to the data tab\nclick on get data\nunder form files i click on text slash\ncsv\nhere you can see we have\nadventure works products i click on\nimport\nlet's click on transform data\nso we have our data\nloaded onto the power query editor\nthe data is mostly clean so let's not\nalter this data let's straight away go\nahead and explore some of the\nstatistical features that we have here\nnow let's say\nif you want to find the total number of\nproduct names in the product table\nwe have this product name column and say\nif you want to find the total number of\nproduct names in the table\nhow to do it\nso what you can do is click on this\nproduct name column\nthen go to the transform tab\nnow in the transform tab you have an\noption called statistics\nclick on this drop down and select count\nvalues\nnow this will open another window\nthat will return the total number of\nproducts in the table you can see the\nvalue here it says 293\nnow to move back to the query editor we\nhave to cancel this step here so let's\njust click cancel or close\nwe are back again\nall right\nnow let's say you want to calculate the\naverage product price from the product\ntable\nso if i move to the right\nyou have a column called product price\nso let's see what is the average product\nprice from the product table so i'll\nselect this product price column\ngo to the transform tab\nunder statistics i'll select average\nso this will give me the average product\nprice which is\n714.42\nyou can consider any unit you want let's\nsay this is in dollars\nnow again we have to cancel this step to\nmove back\nokay\nnow if you want to find the maximum\nminimum product price you can do that as\nwell\nso\nlet me select my column\nproduct price and go to the transform\ntab\nunder the transform tab\nwill click on this statistic drop down\nand let's say i'll select minimum so\nthis will give me the minimum product\nprice which is 2.29\nsimilarly\nif you want to find the maximum product\nprice so select this product price\ncolumn\ngo to the transform tab\nand then choose maximum\nso this is the maximum product price in\nthe product table we have\nlet's cancel this step\nokay\nnow you can also round the product cost\nand product price column to two decimal\nplaces so if i show you both the columns\nyou have your product cost\nand you have the product price column\nyou can see the floating values of the\ndecimal points are not constant it's\nvarying\nso let's limit it to two decimal places\nwhat you can do is select both the\ncolumns and then go to the transform tab\nin the transform tab you have here\nrounding\ni'll click on this drop down and select\nround\nnow here i'll give my\ndecimal places as 2.\nif i click on ok\nyou can see here\nboth the columns the product cost and\nthe product price column have been\nrounded up to two decimal places\ni can scroll down you can see\nall the values have been rounded up to\ntwo decimal places\nall right\nnow\nlet's say you want to add a column\ncalled discount price column\nby multiplying 0.9 to the product price\ncolumn\nand let's say you also want to round\nthat new column to two decimal places so\nhow to do it\nso we want to give a discount of\n10 percent so i'll select this product\nprice column\ngo to add column and then i'll choose\ncustom column\nhere we'll write a formula\nso i'll give my new column name as\ndiscount price\nand\nmy formula would be\ni'll select product price\ni'll click on insert\nand then i'll multiply this product\nprice by\n0.9\nso this will give me my 10 discount\non the product price and click on ok\nyou see here we have a new column added\nwhich is discount price\nso\nif the product price is\n34.99 if you give a 10 discount\nit's 31.491\nall right\nnow the next question was to change the\naround the decimal places to two\nso i'll go to the transform tab under\nrounding and click on round\nlet's say i'll give two and click on ok\nso even this has rounded the discount\nprice column to two decimal places\nnow we are done with our mathematical\noperation on this product data set\nso we saw how to find\nsum average count how to round up values\nhow to add a new custom column\nso let's go ahead and\nclose it\nand load it onto excel\nyou see here we have our\nnew product table added here and\nthe last column if you see it's the\ndiscount column that we added\nokay now it's time for us to explore\nanother feature\nso we'll use a table called adventure\nworks calendar table which has basically\na date column\nand let's see\nhow using power query you can prepare\nthat data as well and make some\nmanipulation some calculations\nso let me go ahead and import adventure\nworks calendars table again this data\nset is provided by microsoft\nso i'll\ngo to my new sheet\nand i'll go to the data tab\nclick on get data and from here i'll\nclick on from text slash csv\nand you can see i have my calendar table\nhere i click on import\nnow this will open in the query editor\nyou see here this data set has only one\ncolumn which is a date column\nso let's click on\ntransform data\nokay\nnow if you see here\nthe first row is actually the\ncolumn name\nso\nlet's do the transformation here let's\npush this as the column name so i'll go\nto the home tab\nand on the home tab you have this option\ncalled use first row as headers i'll\nselect this\nyou see here we have the column name as\ndate\nnow\nbefore making any\noperation let's see\nif all the fields are available\nyou see here if i click on\nthe date drop down\nyear month quarter weekday day\neverything has been\nshaded out and i can't access this the\nreason is\nthe date settings are not correct\nso we change the regional settings let\nme show you how to do it\nso we'll go to file\nand i'll select\noptions and settings and go to query\noptions\nunder query options\nwe have something called as regional\nsettings\nhere\nunder regional settings we'll select\nenglish united states instead of english\nindia\nso i'll just scroll down\nand here we have english united states\nand i click on ok\nnow once this is done\ni'll go to my data type and i'll select\ndate as my data type\ni'll choose replace current\nokay\nnow you can see\nmy date column has been formatted if i\ngo to\nthe date tab you can see i have access\nto all this\nnow let's do some\noperations on this date column\nlet's say you want to\nfind the earliest and the latest date\nfrom aw calendars table or the adventure\nbox calendar table\nso what you can do is select this column\ngo to\ndate drop down under transform and here\nwe have the option of earliest and\nlatest so if i click on earliest\nthis will show you the last date which\nwas 1st of january 2015.\nlet me close this\nsimilarly you can see the most recent\ndate\ni'll go to the date\ndrop down and click on latest\nand you have\n30\njune 2017 as the latest date\ni'll close this\nnow let's add a new column\nsay the name start of the week and\nothers\nso i'll select my date column\ngo to\nadd column\nhere under add column i have\nmy option to\nselect the day name the week name and\nothers so i'll click on this date drop\ndown\nand under day\nlet's say i want to choose\nname of day\nthis returns the d name similarly\nlet's say\ni want to find out\nthe start of the week\nyou can see we have the\nstart of the week column or start of\nweek column now one thing to notice here\nis\nin this power query editor the week\nstarts on a sunday now suppose you want\nto start your week on a monday you can\ndo some transformations on this formula\ntab so here in the formula bar you can\nadd\na one here to make sure your\nweek starts on a monday so if i hit\nenter you will see all these\nvalues will change you can see it's 28 4\nand 11 this will become 29 5 and 12.\nlet's hit enter\nyou can see it here\nyour start of the week is on a monday\nnow there's another method to make sure\nyour week starts on a monday let's\ncancel this step\nokay i have to insert it once again so\ni'll go to date\nand here i'll choose\nstart of week\nnow the week starts on a sunday\nso\none more method is to\nadd day dot\nmonday you can see automatically\npower query is giving me a suggestion so\ni'll hit tab to finish it and i'll hit\nenter\nnow you can see the values have changed\nand our week starts on a monday\nnow let's say\nwe want to add a few more columns like\nstart of month name of month start of\nyear\nand the year value so you can just click\non the\ndate column or select the date column\ngo to the transform tab\nokay not the transform tab let's go to\nthe add column tab\nand here let's say i'll choose year\nso we have all the year values and\nsimilarly\nlet's say i want to know the\nstart of the year\nnow you can do\na few more transformations let's say i\nwant to know the month\nnow here it gives us one which means\njanuary that's february\nmarch and so on and so forth\nlet's say we'll do one more\ni'll click on this\ngo to my\ndate\ndrop down and here i'll choose let's say\ni want to know the day of year\nall right now we are done with all our\ntransformation and preparing our data on\nour date field so let me just go to the\nhome tab i'll click on close and load\nnow this will load the\ndata set on to excel you can see it here\nwe have the data ready now you can use\nthis data to make some\nanalysis\ndraw a pivot table draw a pivot chart\nand do a whole lot of things\nnow while working on a project it is\npossible that not all your data will be\nin a single file\nit could be stored in multiple files so\nit's important to combine and bring all\nyour data together\nnow we will see how to join your data\nvertically\ni have my data present in a csv folder\nso let me show you the folder first\nso this is my csv folder let me open it\nand\ni have some files these are named as\nproject 1 2 3 4 and 5.\nlet me open just one of the project\nfiles\nit has a very small quantity of data\nyou can see it has a month column and an\namount column let me close this\nand\nlet me show it to you again let's open\nproject four\nall the files have the same number of\ncolumns you can see this also has a\nmonth column\nand an amount column\nnow we'll combine all this data together\nand load it into excel let's see how to\ndo it\nso i'll open a new sheet\nand i'll go to my data tab and click on\nget data\nthen i'll go to from file and this time\ni'll choose\nfrom folder\nnow this will ask me\nto give the folder location of the path\nlocation where my csv files are\nso i'll choose\nbrowse\nand here you can see i have my csv file\ni'll just double click on it\nand click on open\nnow it has selected my\nfile path or the folder path\nthen i'll click on ok\nyou can see these are the files you have\nproject1.xls\nproject2.xls and so on\ni'll\nclick on this combine drop-down and i'll\nhit combine and transform\nnow this will give you the preview of\none of the data files\nyou will see it now\nyou can see it here it says sheet1\nokay\nnow it's processing all the\ndata files present in that csv folder\nand this will be uploaded onto our power\nquery editor\nnow you can see here on the power query\neditor\nall my data files have been\ncombined vertically\nhere you can see the month column\non the extreme right it's the amount\ncolumn\nand to the extreme left we have the\nsource name or the\nsource file where the data came from so\nfirst is project one\nthen we have project two\nif i scroll down we have project three\nfiles project four and similarly we have\nproject five\nnow this is one way in which you can\nmerge your tables vertically\nso we are done with it let's just go to\nthe home tab and click on close and load\nall the transformations that were\napplied you can see it here we have our\nfinal table\nand we have successfully\ncombined\nfive excel files\nagain\nyou can also join your data horizontally\nthis would be like an sql join where the\ndata is present in multiple files or\nsheets\nbased on a common key column you can\njoin the tables\nso you can perform a left join a right\njoin and inner join based on the problem\nthat you are trying to solve so let's\nmerge two tables based on a column\ni'll show the data set first it's an\nexcel file which has three worksheets\nso here is my excel file which we'll be\nusing to\nmerge our data horizontally you can see\nthere are three worksheets\nthe first one is year 11 which has data\nregarding the student name\nthe gender of the student and the course\nthe student had opted for\nsimilarly we have another for 2012 or\nyear 12 we have the student name\ngender as well as the course\nand finally we have a courses\ntable or a courses sheet\nwhich has all the details regarding the\ncourse so we have the course name the\nteacher who teaches or teacher who\ntaught that course we have the lesson\ntype the number of credits and the\nassignment type\nnow we'll use this\ndata sets\nto load it onto excel using power query\nso i am on my excel sheet let's just\nopen a new sheet i'll go to the data tab\nand here i'll click on get data and this\ntime i'll choose\nfrom excel workbook and i'll select my\nfile which is students and courses i\nclick on import\nso we'll just see how to import two\ntables and join them horizontally\nso let me first select\nthe courses sheet\nand i'll click on transform data\nnow this has\nloaded the courses table onto power\nquery editor\nthe table looks fine we have the course\ncolumn teacher everything is fine\nnow let's load\none more table and then we'll merge it\nso here under the home tab you have a\nsection called new source\ni'll click on file\ni'll again select my students and\ncourses and click on import\nand this time let's choose\nanother table let's say year 11 which\nhas the column name as student gender\nand course\ni click on ok\nit has successfully loaded this table\nonto power query editor\nnow if you say this\nthe first row is actually our\ncolumn names so i'll go to the home tab\nand select use first row as headers\nso this will push the first row\nto the column names you can see we have\ndone it successfully we have my student\nname\nthe gender column and the course column\nnow let's merge it so\nif you see here in the home tab we have\na section called merge queries\nlet's click on this drop down and select\nmerge\nqueries here\ni have my table which is year 11\nand let's\nchoose one more table\nthat is\ncourses\nnow the kind of join\ni'll choose as left outer join which\nmeans it will take all the\nrows from the first table and matching\nrecords from the second table\nhere i need to select the common key\ncolumn so if you see both the tables we\nhave the course column as the common key\ncolumn so i'll select\nthis and now you can see there's a tick\nmark which means it has selected the\nrows and the column successfully you can\nsee it says the selection matches 175\n175 rows from the first table\nand let's click on ok\nlet's just expand this\nand click on ok\nif i scroll to the right you can see i\nhave successfully merged\nboth the tables\nnow if you want\nyou can remove unnecessary\nrows or columns suppose if you see i\nhave the course column\nfrom the year 11 table and here also i\nhave\nthe course column\nnow this is\nredundant let's just remove one of the\ncolumns i'll just select this column\ni'll go to\nremove columns and i'll select remove\ncolumns\nokay\nthe rest looks fine we have successfully\nmerged both the tables by using a left\nouter join\nlet's just click close and load\nnow this will take some time to load our\ndata onto excel you can see it here we\nhave successfully loaded it on to excel\nnow we are done with our demo part\nnow let's just see\nwhat all we have done in our demo so\ni'll\ngo to my first sheet\nhere you can see\nwe had\nimported a simple\ntext file first and then we plotted a\ngraph which is a pivot chart\nthen you saw\nhow to upload\na file from the web so here we\nimported a\nufo champions league table which was\npresent on wikipedia\nand then we plotted some graphs and\ncharts you can see we made some\nanalysis using pivot tables\nand then we imported another web file\nwhich was based on a population data and\nwe used the unpivot option or the\nunpivot feature in the power query to\nreduce the number of columns\nthen\nwe made some calculations to our\ncustomer table which was from adventure\nworks\nthen we used another table\ncalled the products table here we saw\nsome statistical calculations and we\nadded a column called discount price\nwhere we used conditional operations\nand then\nyou saw how we manipulated\na date column\nand then we saw how to append and merge\nmultiple tables\nbusiness intelligence is a set of\nprocesses and techniques to analyze raw\ndata and extract information that helps\ndrive business decisions it helps you\nkeep track of business data and draw\nvaluable insights there are several\ntools that play a key role in business\nintelligence some of the popular tools\nare power bi tableau and clickview hi\nguys welcome to this tutorial on what is\npower bi in this video you will learn\nwhy power bi is needed what is power bi\nthe various features of power bi and the\ndifferent components of power bi later\nyou will look at the architecture of\npower bi what power bi service is and\nhow to create a power bi dashboard\nfinally you will understand a case study\non myer and do a demo using power bi now\nlet's understand why power bi is needed\nfirst power bi has the ability to access\nvast volumes of data from multiple\nsources it allows you to view analyze\nand visualize huge quantities of data\nthat cannot be opened in excel some of\nthe important data sources available in\npower bi are excel csv xml json pdf etc\nsecond power bi provides an easy to use\ndrag and drop tool with features and\nfunctionalities that allow you to copy\nall formatting across similar\nvisualizations power bi has exceptional\nintegration with excel it helps you\ngather analyze publish and share excel\nbusiness data power bi helps to\naccelerate big data preparation with\nazure using power bi with azure allows\nyou to analyze and share vast volumes of\ndata azure data lake can reduce the time\nit takes to get insights and increase\ncollaboration between business analysts\ndata engineers and data scientists power\nbi allows you to get insights from data\nand turn insights into actions to take\ndata driven business decisions finally\npower bi allows you to perform real-time\nstream analytics it fetches data from\nmultiple sensors and social media\nsources to get access to real-time\nanalytics so you are always ready to\nmake business decisions now let's see\nwhat power bi is power bi is a business\nanalytics service provided by microsoft\nthat lets you visualize your data and\nshare insights it converts data from\ndifferent sources to build interactive\ndashboards and bi reports as you can see\nwe have an excel data about sales\nusing this data power bi helps you build\ndifferent charts and graphs to visualize\nthe data now that we have understood\nwhat power bi is let us look at the\nimportant features of power bi first is\npower via desktop power bi desktop is a\nfree software that you can download and\nit allows you to build reports by\naccessing data easily for using power bi\ndesktop you do not need advanced report\ndesigning or query skills to build a\nreport second as already discussed power\nbi supports stream analytics from\nfactory sensors to social media sources\npower bi assists in real-time analytics\nto make timely decisions third support\nfor multiple data sources is one of the\nmajor features of power bi you can\naccess various sources of data such as\nexcel csv sql server web files etc to\ncreate interactive visualizations and\nfinally custom visualization custom\nvisualization is another vital feature\nof power bi while dealing with complex\ndata power bi's default standard might\nnot be enough in some cases in that case\nyou can access the custom library of\nvisualization that meets your needs let\nus jump into discussing the various\ncomponents of our bi as you can see\nthere are six major components of power\nbi now let's discuss them one by one\nfirst is power query power query is the\ndata transformation and mass of engine\nit enables you to discover connect\ncombine and refine data sources to meet\nyour analysis need it can be downloaded\nas an add-in for excel or can be used as\npart of power bi desktop second we have\npowerpivot powerpivot is a data modeling\ntechnology that lets you create data\nmodels it also allows you to establish\nrelationships and create calculations it\nuses data analysis expression language\nor dacs to model simple and complex data\nthird we have power view power view is a\ntechnology that is available in excel\nsharepoint sql server and power bi it\nlets you create interactive charts\ngraphs maps and other visuals that\nbrings your data to life next we have\npower map microsoft's power map for\nexcel and power bi\nis a 3d data visualization tool that\nlets you map your data and plot more\nthan a million rows of data visually on\nbing maps in 3d format from an excel\ntable or data model in excel\nthen we have power bi desktop power bi\ndesktop is a development tool for power\nquery power pivot and power view with\npower bi desktop you have everything\nunder the same solution and it is easier\nto develop bin data analysis experience\nfinally we have power q and a the q and\na feature in power bi lets you explore\nyour data in your own words it is the\nfastest way to get an answer from your\ndata using natural language an example\ncould be what was the total sales last\nyear once you have built your data model\nand deployed that into power bi website\nthen you can ask questions and get\nanswers easily now let's see what power\nbi service is power bi service is the\nsoftware as a service part of power bi\nit is also referred as power bi online\nto access power bi service you need to\nlog into\napp.powerbi.com now let me show you that\ni'll go to google\nopen a new tab and search for app dot\npower bi dot com\nit's loading\nbut this is how the home page of power\nbi service looks like i have created\nsome dashboards on it first you need to\nlog into app.powerbi service\nyou can see i'm logged in now under my\nworkspace if i go to dashboard here i've\ncreated\na finance dashboard you can see the\ndifferent charts and graphs i have\nprepared and pinned it to the dashboard\nso power bi service allows you to\nconnect to your data create reports and\ndashboards and you can also ask\nquestions to your data\nas you can see in this dashboard we have\ncreated some charts and graphs so this\nis a tree map there's a pie chart\nthere's a bar graph below you can see\nthe line charts and donor charts\nit tells you the total sales that were\nmade the total number of units sold the\nsales by product sales by country sales\nby segment and lots more one of the key\nfeatures of power bi is creating\ndashboards from multiple reports and\ndata sets power bi dashboard is a single\npage visualization to tell a story the\nvisualizations on a dashboard are\ngenerated from multiple reports and each\nreport is based on one data set a single\npage dashboard is known as a canvas the\nvisualizations you see on the dashboard\nare called tiles\nthese styles are pinned to the dashboard\nby report designers\nnow let me go back to my dashboard so\nthis is called a canvas\nand each of these are called tiles so on\nthe top you can see we have three tiles\nnow let's understand how to create and\npublish reports in power bi dashboards\npower bi allows you to create different\nreports on power bi desktop these\nreports can be published on the power bi\ndashboard using power bi service here\nyou can see there is a power bi report\ncreated on power via desktop if you\nclick on publish\nit will take you to the power bi service\nwhere you can build a dashboard here is\nthe button for power bi publish once you\nclick on power bi publish it will take\nyou to the dashboard so this is a single\npage power bi dashboard on power bi\nservice now let's understand the power\nbi architecture power bi architecture is\na service built on top of azure there\nare multiple data sources that power bi\ncan connect to power bi desktop allows\nyou to create reports and data\nvisualizations on the data set power bi\ngateway is connected to on-premise data\nsources to get continuous data for\nreporting and analytics power bi\nservices are basically the cloud\nservices that are used to publish power\nbi reports and data visualizations using\npower bi mobile apps you can stay\nconnected to their data from anywhere\npower bi apps are available for windows\nios and android platforms now let's look\nat a case study on how meyer which is\none of united states largest supermarket\nchains used power bi to solve its\nbusiness problems initially mayer had\nbecome dependent on its it organization\nto extract insights from its data it was\ntime consuming and inefficient as you\nhad to wait for it to build every report\nmayer was unable to perform ad hoc and\nreal-time analysis easily so what maya\ndid was it connected power bi to an\non-premises sql server analysis services\ncube this allowed them to refresh 20\nbillion rows of data in near real time\nwith power bi teams can now pull in the\ndata faster and perform real-time\nanalysis to derive insights from data a\nbakery department inside mayer used\npower bi to compare its sales with\nregional performance they analyzed where\nmeyer was behind the regional trends\nfocused on the problem and created a\nsolution with power bi they can now\ndrill down into hourly sales and send\nout a sales flash to 800 maya business\nleaders so power bi enabled them to\nstandardize data sources and empower\nstore directors and team leaders to\ndevelop and track that data to ensure\nwhat they can improve now let's do some\npractical hands-on demo with power bi so\nthis is how the power bi desktop\ninterface looks like on the left you\nhave the report view the data view and\nthe model view the report view is where\nyou visualize your data with different\ncharts and graphs to build reports the\ndata view allows you to view the whole\ndata while the model view is where you\ncheck if there are any relationship\nbetween the tables\non the right you can see the different\nvisualizations that you can build we'll\nquickly run through all of these in our\ndemo\nso here you can see there's a finance\nsample data that will help you draw\ninsights about the sale of products in\ndifferent countries we will create a\nreport to visualize different charts and\ngraphs and analyze those sales so let me\ngo to my power bi desktop first we'll\nimport our data so let me go to our get\ndata tab and choose excel as my data\nsource i click on excel so here is our\nfinance sample data\nwe'll select sheet1 you can see the data\nhere click on it and then select load\nthis might take some time to load the\ndata now if i go to my data tab you can\nsee the entire data set it has fields\nsuch as segment country in which the\nsales was made the name of the product\nthe units sold and the sales price and\nmany more let's start building our\nreport now i'll go to my report view so\nfirst let me create a text box\nlet me resize it\nlet me name it as\nfinance dashboard we'll increase the\nsize of the text we'll use font consoles\ncenter it we'll also add a background to\nthis we use blue color change it to\nwhite\nand\nincrease the size\nnow let me first show you how you can\ncreate a matrix i'll go to\nvisualizations and click on matrix let\nme resize it\nfrom the datasheet tab i'll select sales\nand drag onto values\nso you can see the total number of sales\nthat were made now let me do some\nformatting so i'll go to the format tab\nclick on column headers let's add a\nbackground color and let me increase the\ntext size to\n20. similarly under values will increase\nthe size of the text\nto 20 as well\nwe can also click on\nborder and choose the color of the\nborder we take as\nlet it be black\nso this is a simple matrix that we\ncreated which shows the total number of\nsales that were made similarly let me\nchoose matrix once again now we'll drag\non the units sold onto values\nwe'll continue with the same drill under\ncolumn headers we'll add a background\nthis time let's choose some other color\nand under values let's increase the size\nof the text to 20.\neven for the column headers let's\nincrease the size of the text to 20.\nagain we will switch on\nborder we resize a bit\nso here we have two matrix created for\nour report\nthe first matrix shows us the total\nsales that were made the second matrix\nshows you the total units that were sold\nnow let's move ahead and create a simple\nbar chart so under visualization i click\non clustered column chart\nunder this we'll drag the date column\nonto access and the sales onto value let\nme expand it so it shows you the sales\nper year this is the sales that were\nmade in 2013 and this shows you the\nsales that were made in 2014.\nnow there's a drill down option which\ngives you more granularity\nthis depicts the sales by quarter\nif i drill down further you can see this\nshows you the sales by month also you\nhave some options like sort by and sort\nby sales so you can see october month\nmade the highest number of sales\nmoving ahead let me now create a pie\nchart where we will see the sales by\ndifferent segments\nunder visualization i'll click on pie\nchart let me first resize it\nhere\ni'll drag the segment column onto the\nlegend\nand the sales column onto the values as\nyou can see we have the sales made by\ndifferent segments\ngovernment segment made the highest\nnumber of sales with 44.22 percent now\nlet me add a border to both the\nvisualization i'll click on the pie\nchart and go to the format tab\ni'll switch on the border similarly for\nthe clustered column chart i'll go to\nthe format tab and click on border now\nlet me resize a bit\nall right next we'll create a very\nsimple table that will depict the total\nsales made by each product so under\nvisualizations i click on table let me\nbring this below\nso from the data sheet i'll first drag\nproduct onto values\nyou can see the different products and\nthen sales just below it\nso this depicts the total sales that\nwere made by each product and finally it\ndisplays the total value of the sales\nthat were made this is same as the one\nshown here\nnow let's do some formatting under\nformat tab i'll go to values and\nincrease the text size to 15\nand expand it\nalso under column headers i'll increase\nthe text size to 15. then let me go and\nadd a border\nnow let me create a map that will show\nyou the sales that were made by each\ncountry so first let me create a new\npage and under visualization i'll click\non map now i'll drag the country column\nonto location\nso you can see we have our map ready and\nwe'll drag sales\nonto size\nyou can see the different countries and\nthe sales that they made if i move the\nmap you can see the sales made in the\neurope region\nlet me resize it i'll add a border to\nthis\nnow let me go ahead and create a donut\nchart that will show you the profit by\neach segment\nunder visualizations i'll click on donut\nchart\nand move this to the top\nnow from the data sheet i'll add profit\nonto the values\nand segment\nonto the legend\nif i expand this you can see government\nsegment made the highest amount of\nprofit with 65.04 percent\nlet me resize this and we'll add a\nborder\nokay in the final visualization i'll\nshow you how to create a tree map this\ntree map will tell you the total amount\nof sales made by each product so under\nvisualizations i'll click on the tree\nmap let me expand it\ni'll drag sales onto values and product\nonto group so here you can see our tree\nmap and the sales made by each product\nyou can see now we have our report ready\nwe have created two separate canvas to\nvisualize our data\nnow\nif you want to change the color of this\nbars then simply go to the format tab\nand under data colors you can choose\nwhichever color you want in power bi\ndesktop you have an option to switch\nyour theme this will make your dashboard\nor the report look more attractive so\nnow we are under the default mode let's\ntry out different themes\nthat's frontier\ntemperature\nsolar which is a little yellowish the\none which i like is tidal\ni hope this was helpful in making you\nunderstand the basics of power bi and\nhow it works you learned the various\nfeatures and the components of power bi\nand looked at the architecture of power\nbi finally you saw a demo to create a\nreport using finance data set\nso what are the benefits of power bi\nhere are some of the benefits\nso extract intelligence rapidly and\naccurately so that's\nbasically transforming your enterprise\ndata into rich visuals and accurate\nreports for enhanced decision making now\none thing we already know\nthat when we talk about data data in raw\nformat might have lot of hidden\ninformation if we look at different data\nsets which i'll show you in the process\nit might have a lot of meaning but then\nthe real meaning comes out of the data\nif we can create visualizations if we\ncan create relationships between\ndifferent data sets and thus that can\nhelp us in enhanced decision making\nnow\npower bi supports advanced data services\nit integrates seamlessly with advanced\ncloud services like cortana to provide\nresults for the verbal data queries as\nwell\nwhen you talk about\nseamlessly integrating with existing\napplications that's one more benefit of\npower bi so it adopts analytics and\nreporting capabilities easily to embed\ninteractive visuals quickly in your\napplications you can build rich\npersonalized dashboards so it basically\nprovides a unified user experience with\ncustomized dashboard and reports that\nmeet your exact needs\nit also has a way where you can have\nsecure way of publishing your reports so\nyou can set up automatic data refresh\nand rapidly publish reports allowing\nmultiple users to avail the latest\ninformation across your organization or\nacross your working community\nso power bi can connect to different\nsources we'll see that in a while so\nbasically you have an option which says\nget data and that basically opens up a\nwindow where you can find different type\nof data sources such as excel your csv\nor text json pdf\ngetting data from databases or directly\naccessing data from databases now before\nwe get further\ninto understanding how power bi looks\nlike it would be a good idea to share\ninformation in how you can set that up\non your machine so when it comes to your\npower bi\nand let me open up a notepad here\nso for example i bring up a notepad\nlet's say when you talk about your power\nbi components\nso you basically have\npower bi desktop\nand that's mainly your playground or\nthat's mainly used for\nany kind of development activities\nyou have your power bi server\nor you can say service so now this one\nis where you would make reports\nonline\nand\nshare or\nmake them available\nto different bus\nnow that's one more component of rbi and\nthen you also have your power\nvi mobile which is mainly for\nviewing the information i would say\nviewing reports so these are the three\nmain components we can also look at the\nlicensing information of these so these\nare the main so power bi desktop is\nsomething which you can set up on your\nlaptop or on your machine\npower bi server is where you can log in\nwith your user id and password and power\nbi mobile is mainly to view your reports\nnow how do you set this up before you\ncan explore or start working on power bi\nso here is a link\nwhich you can basically use\nso if you look into this\nso this one basically says service self\nservice sign up for power bi it says\nsign up of power bi service as an\nindividual normally when you would want\nto\nuse power bi you can use a website\ncalled http\nand then you have basically\napp\nand\nlet's say\ni think it's called app powerbi.com\nnow this is the place where you can\nbasically log in now if you see here i\nhave created an account and if you look\nat my account it says auatl.on\nmicrosoft.com now how do you get this\nkind of email because when you talk\nabout power bi it will expect you to\nhave a official id and it does not take\nids which are from common\ndomains such as google or yahoo and so\non so this particular link gives you an\nidea how you can do that\nso basically you have what is power bi\nbasic explanation on that it says\nsigning up for power bi service so power\nbi desktop it's a totally free download\nand then you have mobile apps also a\ntotally free download and here it says\nthat what kind of email addresses it\nsupports and if you look into this you\nhave to either\nsign up because that does not accept\nyour private email ids or you can go for\nthis one which says enroll us government\norganization\nand this is where you can basically sign\nup for power bi so\nit basically says try free if you go to\nthe website say powerbi.microsoft.com\nor you could go into this one which i\nwas saying\nhttp\nslash\napp.yourpowerbi.com\nand this is what you can use or as\nmentioned you can go to\npowerbi.microsoft.com\nfor example if i open this in a\ndifferent tab\nit takes me to power via microsoft i can\nsay start free i can click on this\nit says drive free but then when it asks\nyou to sign in this is where\nsome of us face problem because it does\nnot take your private email id now how\ndo you tackle that what you can do here\nis\non this page which says learn about\nalternate ways to sign up you can\nbasically open up this link and in this\nlink it says sign up for power bi with\nthe new microsoft 365 trial\naccount and what you can do is you can\nbasically\nclick on this link\nwhich takes you to the office 365\nand what you can do here\nis you can search for something which\nsays say 365 e3\nand here you have tried for free\nso in my case it is translating okay\nso here you have an option which says\ntry it for free click on this one and\nthen basically go ahead with your signup\nprocess now once you do that you can\nbasically create an account or give a\nemail id so it asks you to give an email\nid to check if you already have an\naccount\nand once you do that it will guide you\nthrough the process where you can create\nan account like i have done\nnow once you have done that so for\nexample we can go into\nmy\nthis page which i said http slash\napp\npower bi.com\nnow once you have created an account you\nwould be asked to login now i can click\nand log in here\nand then basically given my password\nand once i do that it takes me to the\npower bi server or service now\non the top right it might say that go\nfor a trial version i have already\nselected that and this is a pro trial\nwhich is giving me validity for 60 days\nso this is the service which i can use\nnow what it means is i can be using my\npower bi desktop which would be also\ninstalled so once you log into this page\nyou can\nbasically click on apps you can\nbasically search for something like\npower bi and that will show up in the\napp and you can install and download on\nyour machine now once that is there you\ncan basically bring it up so for example\nin my case i can just say power\nbi desktop\nand that's the app which i have\ninstalled on my machine\nand basically that comes up so that's\nyour power bi desktop which is coming up\nand\nit will still ask you to sign in so that\nyou can share your information\nthrough power bi so you see here on the\ntop i'm already signed in\nand here it also shows you some\ntutorials and videos which basically\nhelps you in getting to know something\nmore or what's new so you can always\nbrowse that\nso you would have your power bi desktop\nwhich would be set up\nyou would also have your power bi\nservice which would be running and then\nbasically whatever you have developed on\nyour power bi desktop you can share that\nthrough the power bi service\nnow usually when you talk about\nlicensing i can give you brief insights\nhere so you basically have\nyour\npower bi service as i said licensing so\nyou have the pro version\nwhich is basically\nuh your\npoint nine dollars\nper user\nper month\nand basically it has some kind of\nlimitation so it has say max 10 gigabyte\nyou can work on\nsome features like incremental refresh\nis not allowed you can always look onto\nthe microsoft website for more details\nand in those kind of cases you usually\ngo for the premium account if you are a\nextensive user\nand premium account basically is\nconditional based so it depends on your\nrequirements and then basically you pay\nfor the service what you use so that's\nmainly about your servicing now when you\ntalk about your server and service as i\nsaid it is basically making your reports\nonline and sharing and making them\navailable to different bus so that is\nthe highlight so when you talk about\nsharing reports that's one of the things\nyou have anomaly detection\nthat's also possible here\nyou can talk about automation of reports\nyou have\nsecurity that is you can go for role\nbased or\nrow level based kind of security\nimplementation all those are some of the\nfeatures of your power bi server and\nservice so it is good to know and\nbasically have your desktop and power bi\nservice setup now once you have that\nthen you basically have your power bi\nnow\nwhen you talk about your power bi it\nbasically helps you with various things\nso this is how easily you can have it\nset up and then basically you can\nexplore this so for example as i was\nsaying power bi can connect to different\ndata sources now i do have an option\nhere which says get data i can click on\nthis and that shows me all the different\ndata sources i can even click on more\nif i'm interested in looking what more\npower bi desktop tool helps me to do so\nit shows me all the different ways in\nwhich you can get the data you see here\nthe servers so the database services\nyour folders your different formats you\ncan click on file formats or databases\nyou can look at power platform so if\nbasically you are connecting to a\nplatform and getting some services you\ncan connect to the cloud that is azure\nyou have online services and then you\nhave other options so these are all the\nways in which you can get your data when\nyou talk about visualizations you see a\nlot of\nvisualization options here which can be\nused once your data is loaded\nand i will explore and explain more\nabout this so you have\nsomething called as insert\nwherein you can go in for different\nvisuals or different types\nyou can also get into say transform the\ndata now that basically is going to pop\nup and bring a power query editor now\nthat's where a lot of your etl works\nhappen so when you when you do a\ntransform data it opens up power query\neditor\nwhich we can use to transform the data\nor change the data or modify the data as\nper our requirement before\nloading all of it into our power bi\nso you also have option here which says\nmodeling wherein we can create new\ntables or we can work on our data where\nwe can manage relationships so as of now\nwe don't have any data so it does not\nshow this one is activated but that can\nbe activated this is where you can view\nyour reports so this is in short\nexploring your power bi we'll see what\nare the different options which we can\nuse here\nso\nit basically supports different kind of\ndata so when we look at the\nvisualization pane that\nbasically allows us to create different\nkind of visualizations here and we will\nunderstand that\nso\nyou can basically visualize on your\ndifferent data\nand create different kind of charts\ngraphs maps\nand basically derive insights from your\ndata now when you talk about data models\nthat's where you can\nbasically establish relationships so\nwhen you talk about data models\nit is basically used to connect multiple\ndata sources to build a relationship now\nwe might have different data sets or we\nmight have data coming in from different\ntables where we may want to basically\nget insights or get data from multiple\ndata sources\nfor our purpose now in that case data\nmodels to help us so for example if you\nhave two tables let's look at the\nstandard tables so you have products\nlookup table\nand you also have the sales table now\nusually what you have in any kind of\nscenario is\nif we basically say you have\nyour data tables so that's basically\nwhere your data resides and then you\nhave series of your lookup tables so\nusually you might have say your data\ntables here\nand this is what i'm talking about which\nmight have some data for example let's\nsay\nsales is one of them you might have some\nother data table which might be for\nexample let's say budget table\nor might be something else\nand\nthese are your data tables now at the\nother end you might have your lookup\ntables so basically you have various\nlookup tables\nand these lookup tables for example\nlet's say this one is\ncustomer this one is territory\nlet's say this is product\nand let's say this one is a calendar\nso these are basically my lookup tables\nso we can basically as i said your data\nmight be coming in from different\nsources let's say database or let's say\nsome kind of files or let's say\nsome kind of systems what you have so\nyour data might be coming in from\ndifferent places now\nyou might want to transform the data so\nthis is where i could say there is your\nquery editor which i was explaining so\nyou have your query editor which\nbasically allows you to edit the data\ntable or basically allows you to edit\nthe data before it is loaded right you\ncan hide a column you can add a new\ncolumn you can modify your column so\nyour query editors would be basically\nused to work on\nthe data which goes into your data\ntables now\nyou might have a lot of lookup tables as\ni said so let's say these are my\nlookup tables\nand these are my data tables\nso what we need is sometimes we need\ninformation\nbased on\nour lookup tables and data tables now\nthat's where data modeling comes into\npicture so basically if i\nwould want to extract information from\nhere so i can notice that there is a\nproduct key here\nand there is a product key here now this\nis where we are already talking about\nsay foreign keys or we are talking about\nyour relationships right now when you\ntalk about relational databases you have\nsomething called as foreign key\nconstraints which is\nin in power bi terms i would say it's\nnot exactly a constraint but it is more\nof a filter propagation instead which is\nused to basically connect your different\ndata sources and you could have\nbasically\ncross filter directions you can go for\nsingle\nor one to one or one to many or many to\nmany kind of relationships which\nbasically allows you to work on the data\nso we will learn more about data models\nwhen we are doing a quick demo there\nwhere we can talk a little bit about\nnormalization and denormalization\nthe way the data exists\nright and then you basically would want\nto gather insights from your data so\nwhen you talk about your\ntwo data sources as i said so you have a\nproducts lookup table you have a sales\ntable now if you would want to calculate\nthe total order quantity of each product\nname\nwhich is we are talking about the order\nquantity as a\ninformation here and you have product\nname here now how do you get that\ninformation what we see here is we would\nwant something like this or we would\nwant more information so how do we do\nthat so what we can do is\nthe order quantity for each product is\nbasically showing us the same value now\nthis is because the product and sales\ntables are not connected and there is no\nrelationship between them even if you\nwould want to take two sources and just\nget information out of them probably i\nwould complain that there is no\nrelationship established between them so\nwhat we do is we create a data model so\nwhat we do is we build a relationship\nbetween both the tables using a common\nkey column which exists in both cases as\ni said there is a product key here\nthere is a product key here so that\nbasically allows us to have a\nrelationship between these two now that\ncould be\none to one this could also be related to\nother tables so it could be one too many\nyou could have many to one so all those\nrelationships are possible so product\nkey is basically used to create a\nrelationship you see the arrow mark and\nthen there is also this star which can\nbasically mean one to many now\nwhen the product key is used to join\nthese two tables or form a relationship\nthen we can look at the product names\nand the order quantities which basically\ngives me a total now that's the basic\nuse of your data models now what about\nthis dax so basically data analysis\nexpressions now that's a\nlibrary of functions and operators that\ncan be combined to build formulas and\nexpressions and power be a desktop\nusually when we work on our data sources\nwhen we would want to connect them it\nautomatically shows us this data\nanalysis expressions however this gives\nus\nextension it basically gives us more\npower to work on our data\nnow sometimes instead of working on dax\nor dax expressions it would be good to\ngo for better data modeling and have the\nrelationships established better and\nsometimes when the relationships are\nestablished you could use your tax which\nbasically gives you more power on\nworking on your data so your values are\ncalculated based on information from\neach row of a table\nit appends values to each row in a table\nand stores them in the model\nit increases the file size so that's\nwhat happens now you can right click on\nany column to add a new column and for\nexample in this one it shows that there\nwas a quantity type calculated column\nwhich was based on the calculation what\nwe see here on the top in the in the\nexpression bar which says what kind of\ncalculation was performed and that\nbasically gives us the value for\nquantity type and that is basically\nadded here to our existing data\nso that's the\npower\nof dax and power bi so you also have\nsomething called as\nmeasures so dax allows you to create new\ncalculated columns and measures so\nbasically here if you see we are\nworking on aw underscore sales and then\nwe have selected quantities sold\nand\nwhat we are looking at in the report is\nwe can basically right click on any\ntable name to add a new measure here so\nwe have added what we call as quantity\nsold\nas the measure so values are calculated\nbased on information from any filters in\nthe report we will see this how this can\nbe done\nand that basically here the measure does\nnot increase the file size it does not\ncreate new data in the table themselves\nin comparison to what we were seeing\nearlier that is your calculated columns\nso these are your type of dax functions\nso dax allows you to create new\ncalculated columns and measures\nso you have date and time which\nbasically allows you to work on date and\ntime\ndata or fields you have logical\nfunctions which allow us to create new\nfilters or add more filters to our data\nyou have text functions which basically\nallows\nus to say transform the data into a\nlower case or an upper case or basically\nget the length of a string or\nconcatenate two fields\nor basically\ndo a filtering based on some criterias\nor replacing some content you also have\nstatistical functions which can be used\nyou have information functions which can\nbe used so these are different types of\ndax functions\nwhich we can use in power bi\nso we will learn more on power bi\nthrough a quick demo where we can\nuse some data sets and those data sets\ncould be found on internet although i\ncan also upload that on a github link\nand you will have access to those data\nsets so let's learn about power bi\nthrough a quick demo\nby uploading some data sets and playing\nwith those data sets\nlet's\nlook at a sample data set and let's\nupload it\nand as i explained while uploading let's\nalso transform the data so that we can\nhave selective\nfields so selected data loaded here\ninstead of loading the complete data set\nand then let's see how we can visualize\nthis or how we can use the information\nin this data set now what we can do here\nis we can click on get data and then we\ncan choose one of the data formats which\nwe would be\nlooking for so for example i can go for\nexcel\nand basically\nclick on this now here are some of my\ndata sets\nso let's look into the folder here\nand\nthese data sets are also available on my\ngithub link which i'll share with you\nlater so here we have something called a\nsuperstore let's click on this and here\ni already have a data set which is\nglobal super store or i also have\nselective data so let's\nselect this one\nclick on open\nnow\nthat's basically connecting to my data\nsource and that will show me what does\nthat excel sheet have so it has\ndifferent tabs\nwhich is orders people and returns so\nlet's select orders\nand that basically gives me a preview of\nthe data which i have and if you scroll\nall the way to right it shows me city\nstate\nand then country and if you see here we\ndo see information of all the countries\nnow this can be huge amount of data\nwhich may which we would want look into\nbut say for example my use case is that\ni'm interested in looking for the data\nfor united states and\nas a country and all its states so we\nwill do that when we do a transform\nnow we can also select the returns tab\nand that shows me\nthese three fields however the first row\nshould have been the heading\nof this\nparticular data set and we will\ntransform that now i can go ahead and\nclick on load but that will load all the\ndata so instead of that let's go for\ntransforming so let's click on transform\ndata now once you do that it brings you\nyour toolkit that brings you your power\nquery editor which allows you to\ntransform your data so for example we\nhave\nour data from returns tab or returns\ndata source as you see here so we see\ncolumn 1 column 2 and column 3 and that\nalso shows the type of\nthe data here\nit also gives me this quick small option\nhere let's select this and then i can\nsay use first row as header now there\nare various other options which you can\ndo you can add a custom column you can\nadd column with examples you can keep\nthe top rows you can remove the top rows\nyou can keep errors keep duplicates so\nthere are different ways and you can\nalso do a merge query or append query so\nas of now let's just say use first row\nas headers\nand that basically shows that now my\nfirst row has become the header you also\nsee\nin the applied steps it basically tells\nme if i have changed the type of the\ndata\nif i have made any other changes those\nsteps will get added here so it\nbasically shows me the name as it\nreturns it shows me applied steps where\ni have changed the type\nand now i basically have this\ninformation now this is something where\nyou can change the type or you can\nbasically set it to a particular format\nhowever we are not doing anything of\nthat sort right now\nso we can do that for any of these\ncolumns so this looks good when it comes\nto orders let's click on this and as i\nsaid i would be interested in selecting\nfor country as united states only\nand let me just work on that data\nhowever we can work on all the data so\nlet me scroll all the way to right and\nhere i have the country now there are\nthese filters which we can use\nso basically i can click on this and\nthat shows me all the countries are\nselected now there is also something\ncalled as text filters which we will see\nhow we can use to select particular data\ni basically have\nother ways of filtering the data so for\nexample now i will just uncheck the\nselect all and what i would be\ninterested is in united states so let's\ntype it here that shows me has an option\nhere\nselect this and then basically say okay\nso that should basically now filter out\nand it shows me the data is united\nstates\nonly and then you have different states\nand rest of the data remains so if you\nlook at the applied steps it tells me\nthat there are filtered rows now we have\ndone the basic transformation for this\ndata set\non these two data sources that is orders\nand returns so here you have an option\nwhich says close and apply so close the\nquery editor window and apply any\npending changes you can click on this\nand it says apply so for example i can\njust say apply for now\nand that should basically apply the\nchanges\nwhich i have performed\nusing my query editor that is i have\ntransformed the data so that i can have\nselective\ndata uploaded in my power bi now it's\ndoing that it shows me it is working on\nboth of these data sources that is\norders and returns so that's done and\nnow basically if there are any other\npending changes we can\njust do a close and apply\nso that basically has closed and now you\nwould see the data appearing here\nso i have uploaded the data\nas per\nmy preferences now if you click on\nthe data tab here\nso it basically shows you your data\nfields it might take some time to\npopulate but if you see in the country\nfield now\nif even if i click on the filter it just\nshows me united states now that's what\nwe wanted so we have already uploaded\nthis data in orders you can always\nexpand the\noption here which shows me all the\nfields which are there in this might be\nthis is an aggregation might be that's\nan ordered date so this is again some\nkind of aggregation we can change the\ndata types so we are looking at all the\nfields in my orders table or basically\ncoming from the orders data source i\nalso have returns which shows me three\nfields and that shows me the data which\nis returned order id and region so the\ncolumn names are applied correctly as we\nwant and that basically looks fine now\nwe can also look at\nyour\nmodel so when you click on model it\nshows me these two however there is no\nas of now relationship established\nbetween them so it says\nunder properties select one or more\nmodel objects to set their properties so\nright now these are not related there is\nno relationship established between them\nso if i would want some data which\nrelates to orders and returns\nthen that would fail because it would\nsay there is no relationship now i can\ngo to\nthe first option which says report and\nwe have not created any report here\nalthough we can create a simple report\nwe can look at the data so we have our\norders field now\nwe can basically pull out some\ninformation from here we can choose what\nkind of report we may want to create so\nfor example let's go for\nthe table option from visualizations you\nhave various options here which we can\nuse\nthis is where you can do a formatting\nthis is where you can select the fields\nthis is where you can search and filter\nout the data you can also add data\nfields here so first let's click on\ntable\nand that basically gives me a table now\nthis table\nas of now does not have anything so you\ncan use the filter and slices\noption here which will affect the\nvisualization or basically what you can\ndo is now since we have\norders here so this is my orders and i\nwould like to work on this so let's say\nfor example country is\ni can select country as a field and if\nyou say it shows me country is all as of\nnow and it says the value is united\nstates what i can also do is i'm\ninterested in the states\nso i have state now i can basically drag\nand drop it here and then the state gets\nadded here so i can basically say select\nall\nand that should basically take care of\nmy\nstate field being added here\nso\nstate is all country is all\nnow\nwe can basically look at something else\nso might be let's choose sales\nand i can just drag and drop sales here\nso that basically says\nif you would want to have any kind of\nadvanced filtering which says filter\ntype so go for advanced filtering is\nless than or equal or you can also go\nfor advanced filters so\nthat's fine as of now so we have added\nsome fields here\nand that's basically\nmy data here\nso let's go for\nfilters here\nwhich basically should select all my\nfields\nnow if you see the visualization shows\nmy country\nsales and state which we had either by\nselecting the fields and dropping\nthem here or you can\nin this section where it says field so\nyou can for example let me show it again\nso i can just delete this\ni can click on the table option\ni can just drag it here\ni can basically make it bigger and i\nneed to add data to this one so it says\nadd data fields here so now let's say\ncountry\nis what we are interested in we are also\ninterested in states\nso let's drop that here and let's say\nsales so this is also what i'm\ninterested so i'm looking at one\nspecific country i'm looking at sales\nper state and when we look at\nsales it basically tells me that this is\nsummation so you will basically get\nthe total sales which have happened now\nwe are looking at this data here we can\nalways go to formatting we can click on\ngrid we can basically increase the font\nhere we can change the grid color so for\nexample let's make it for example\nblue\nso i can just select this\nand it should basically\nallow me to have the grid color as blue\nnow i can go in for the grid thickness i\ncan go for row padding outline color\nso we can basically make it a little bit\nmore readable\nand then we can basically increase the\nfont size\nhere to look at the information\nand you have other options here so what\nwould you want to do with column headers\nso i can basically have the font color\nbackground color is fine\ndo you want to have an outline\ndo you want to have a change in font\nwhat is the text size might be we can\nmake the heading a little bigger\nand then basically you also have the\nfield formatting so all those could be\ndone you could go for background and all\nthese things can be done in formatting\nso now we already have our data here and\nthis\nbasically looks good and this is\nbasically\none of my visuals\nwhich i have here\nand this has given me some information\nfor sales and basically i can scroll\nthis i can\nalso make it bigger so i could select a\nparticular field if i'm more interested\nin looking at the information for a\nparticular state now i can add more\nfields to this\nso this is\nmy\none of the reports which i have created\nnow\nwhat\ni can do with this report is i can\nbasically have more data fields i can\nadd filters to this\ni can basically look into all the data\nhere by just clicking somewhere in the\ngrid but somewhere outside if you select\na particular row then that data shows up\nhere you have an option of focus mode\nwhich you can go for you can look at the\nother options which says export data now\nif this is the data which you are\ninterested in\nyou can export it you can always to\nshow as a table if you are interested in\nyou can do a sort by country sales or\nstate so for example let's do a sorting\nby state\nand that basically gives me the data\nwhich has been sorted by state\ninformation now we could obviously have\nthe information here so i can then\nchange the order so it shows me\nalphabetically this is the information\nwhich i have so i've created a simple\nvisualization using the data which i\nhave and what i can do is i can click on\nsave so that basically asks me to save\nthis as a power bi file which has an\nextension of pbi x and i can basically\ncall it my report so let's say\nfirst\nreport\nand here i can say country\nor i can say\nstate\nwise\nsales\nin\nusa\nlet's say\nusa\nand that basically is my first report\nnow\nonce you have saved this report you can\nalways look on your machine for example\nif i go in here\nand if i go into this folder might be i\nshould look on desktop\nand\nthis is where i should have saved it\nso it shows me first report statewide\nthat will open up in power bi and we\nhave created a simple report which we\nhave basically used by taking our data\nnow i can also do is i can publish this\nif i would want to\nshare this information so\npublish this report online in power bi\nservice\nyou can basically select\nyour report what we have here\nand i clicked on publish so it says\nwhat's the destination so you can have\ndifferent workspaces i will choose the\ndefault that's my workspace i can click\non select now it says publishing first\nreport statewide sales in usa to power\nbi you can create a portrait view of\nyour report and you can do all that\nstuff so let it publish and then we can\nbasically look into our power bi server\nthat's a service where the information\nis already shared\nor published i would say which can then\nbe shared with different resources so we\ncan come here\nand basically i can look into the power\nbi\nand this is where i will be able to look\ninto my workspaces and let's look in my\nworkspace so it says this is the place\nwhere i had initially downloaded power\nbi data set it says your data set is\nready let power bi help you explore your\ndata right so you can always do this you\ncan click on view data set\nwhich basically allows you to\nbring out your workspace and first\nreport state wise sales now that's the\nreport which we have published so let's\nfirst check in our desktop if that's\ndone so it says\nsuccess open first report in power bi\nnow i can click on this one straight\naway and that takes me to my service\nnow once it takes me to the service it\nshows me\nthe report which we created which we\npublished and it basically has the\noption where i can save it\nas\na\na different copy or give a different\nname i can embed this in\na website or a portal i can publish to\nweb\nembed this report for public access by\nanyone on the internet we can do that we\ncan export it to powerpoint so we can do\nall these options you also have an\noption of view where you can change the\nview\nyou can basically also edit report here\nso you can do that if you are interested\nin something specific\nyou can do a sharing two teams so if you\nhave your teams or groups set up you can\nshare it with them\nyou have an option of common panes you\ncan basically\nview usage metrics report now that can\nbe sometimes helpful\nyou can basically go ahead and go and\nsubscribe a particular report so if\nthere are new changes made you will be\nthe one who will be informed you can\nclick on share now if i click on share\nhere from my service it says only users\nwith power bi pro will have access to\nthe support recipients will have the\nsame access as you unless row level\nsecurity on the data set further\nrestricts them so i can grant access and\nthis is where i will have to give the\nemail ids of the people with a message\nthat i would want to have them\nlook at this report\nright you can also allow recipients to\nbuild new content using the underlying\ndata sets and you can send an email\nnotification to the user so as of now i\ndon't have any other groups so i'll not\nbe sharing it but i have created a\nsimple report now let's also look at\nedit report let's just to see what it\nhelps us and when you click on edit\nreport\nit basically brings up this one which\nsays your file\nview\nit gives you the filters it basically\nallows you to add data fields to this so\nit is basically giving access to these\ndata sets\nwhich were in my desktop\nit is basically allowing you to give or\ncreate different visualizations\nnow here we have the data which we are\nlooking at and if say for example\nsomebody is interested in filtering the\ndata so you could do that so you could\nclick on filter here and that basically\napplies this is the filter we have now\ncountry is fine sales\nmight be i can click on sales and i\nwould say okay let's look at\nsales which is more than a particular\namount so we can say is\ngreater than and might be i can give a\nnumber here so i can say 30 000\nand basically\ni can say apply filter\nso right now i'm liking filter and i\nwould look at the values\nwhich also shows me the total value is\nchanged so\nyou have not only created a report you\nhave published it and now\nfrom the service you can edit it so i'm\nlooking at particular data here and then\nbasically i can click on file and i can\nsave it or i can say save a copy of the\nreport and let's say\ni will call it\nthe same name so i'll say first\nreport\nunderscore\nstate wise\nsales\nand i will say modified\nso let's do a save\nand the report has been saved\nso now you're looking at the data here\nso\nthat is basically giving you information\nso when i click on my\nworkspace here\ni can click on reports and that does\nshow me my previous report it shows me\nthe modified report it gives me an\noption of looking at the usage metrics\nreport so say for example you want to\nclick on this one and it will basically\ngive you the usage metrics so let's\nclick on this one\nand\nthat basically shows me the report usage\nmetrics which is generated so views for\nday unique viewers per day\nyou would want to look at the different\nplatforms who was using it views by user\nand this can be sometimes useful if we\nwould want to look into this one now i\ncan go back to my workspace i can click\non reports\nand that basically\ntook me to usage metrics i could be\nsharing it\ni can analyze in excel\ni can look for quick insights based on\nthis data what we have\nyou can basically look at the related\ninformation you can also look at the\nsettings of this one\nand basically this is how you have your\ndata report here now that also shows me\nthe data sets option so which basically\ngives me the data sets which can be used\nto create further reports\nand we have our data here\nso\nfor example if i click on create\nreport it basically gives me these data\nsets and we can continue working on this\nso this is how i have a simple report\ncreated without\nbasically working on two different data\nsources but i have selected some data\nhere\nand then i can basically add details to\nthis so for example now if we look at\norders and say for example this is the\ndata i have and say you would want to\nadd some fields so let's go to returns\nand say for example i would be\ninterested in looking at\nthe the products so might be what i\nshould do is i should replace the report\nhere instead of country it would be\ninteresting to look at\nthe product\nwhich we have or basically customer id\nso we can look at customer id we can\nlook at the order id which would be\ninteresting to see if there is a\nparticular order\nwhat was the sales which was generated\nand if there were any returns which were\nhappening on that so for example here\nwhen i have these let me cut out country\nas a field and i will basically take\norder id and place it here\nso now if you see my data has been\neasily modified\nso i have my order id i have sales and i\nhave\nstatewide information so\nyou have basically all the information\nbut this is now order id state and so on\nnow what if i would want to\nalso see\nbased on the order id if i say i would\nwant the returned field\nso for example i would want to take this\none and let's drag and drop it here\nnow that says cannot display the visual\nnow why is that so if you click on see\ndetails that says cannot determine\nrelationships between the fields so it\ncannot display the data because power bi\ncannot determine the relationship\nbetween two or more fields\nand how do we fix that so for example if\ni click on fix this now it says\nthere is a missing relationship between\nthese fields use auto detect to search\nfor relationships or create them\nmanually now i can click on auto detect\nwhich will try to search for fields\nwhich exist in both the data sets or\nbasically i can create relationships so\nlet's click on create relationships and\nthat basically takes me to this page\nwhich says there are no relationships\ndefined\nfrom table to table and so on\nso\ni can click on new\nnow here it says select the tables and\nthe columns that are related now i can\nsay orders now those are my fields where\nyou have order ids and it automatically\nshows\nthat returns also has an order id\nfield although all the values might not\nbe same but this is how you can create a\nrelationship and it says the cardinality\nsays many to one so you can have\nbasically many to one relationship you\nare saying cross filter direction is\nsingle\nso make this relationship active and it\nhas already helped us basically\nidentifying the field so i can say okay\nso it says\nnow these two tables should be related\nor should be connected based on order id\nso\nhere we have this and let's basically\nsay close\nnow\nonce that is done\nif you see\ni have order id i have returned\ni have sales column and i have state and\nif you see in returned i do have a value\nof yes\nwhich shows\nthis particular order id had generated\nsome sales\nand it was for state alabama and it was\nreturned\nand the value is yes so if you scroll\ndown you basically see all the values\nnow we can add different filters where\nwe can say i would want only yes and no\nnow this is again an interesting report\nso let's go in also into the formatting\nand what we can do is we can look at say\nthe grid option if we would want to\nbasically say vertical grid and let's\nsay\non\nand it says vertical grid color so let's\nselect this might be i can try doing a\nblack here it puts it in the right nice\ntable format\nand that basically looks good so you\nhave\nsales\nreturned and so on and this is basically\nthe order which i am seeing here so for\nexample if i would want to\nchange the order and if i'm saying okay\ni would like to look at sales and\nreturned and so on so we can be doing\nthat we can come here and say for\nexample i have sales and returned let's\ntry\nmoving the sales column over here\nmight be state is\nan information which we would want in\nthe beginning so let me also\nmove the states all the way here so it\ngives me state it gives me the order id\nsales and if\nthere was\na return which was happening on that\nparticular product so easily i've\nmodified my report now what i can do is\ni can just save it\nand i can do the same thing so i can\npublish it i can basically continue\nusing it or i can work on a new report\nso let's continue learning and\nnow here we will also see\nhow you can load some data and perform\nsome transformations and basically get\nmultiple results or multiple tables or\nmultiple data sets which can be then\nfurther used for reporting so power bi\ndoes give you a lot of options now here\nyou have an option as we saw earlier\nthat is get data or what you can do is\nyou have an option where you can\ncreate new data also it says enter data\nnow this is something which can be\neasily used if you have\nrelatively\nless number of fields so you can\nbasically add\nmore\ncolumns here and you can basically add\nvalues so for example if i would just\ncall it something like\num\nscientist id\nokay and then i can say scientist name\nand then basically i can say\nuh\ndomain\nand then i can\nsay for example let's say\nyear of joining and\nand i can keep adding the number of\ncolumns here i can delete the columns\nright and i can give this and i can say\ncountry\nso\nthat's it and now we have created these\nfive\ncountries sorry five columns which we\nhave given some names and we can start\nentering some values so\ni can basically say let this scientist\nid be\n22 3 4\ni can give some name so let's give peter\nlet's say domain and i can say\nbiotechnology\ni can give year of joining 2011 and i\ncan say germany as the country\nand\ni really don't want this particular\ncolumn so i can go ahead and delete this\nnow i can come here\nand then i can give something else so i\ncan say this is scientist id\ni can give john\nlet's say\nthe scientist is mainly working in\nphysics\nand then i can say 2018 and let's say\nfrance\nand go back here and let's say\n4567 and let's say\nmarie\nand let's say\nshe does her research in\nmolecules and let's call it 2001\nand let's say\nitaly\nokay and you can continue adding data in\nthis way now you can\nsay if the data is already here so i can\nsay for example no i do not want\nthis particular row\ni do not want this particular row\nso\nyou can basically keep adding values\nhere now you can say edit\nso here we have to give some name so\nlet's say\nscientists\nokay\nand then\nif you choose edit\nit basically brings up your power bi\neditor which allows you to work on these\nfields\nif you would want to make some changes\nnow we can make some changes here we can\nsee\nwhat are the number of rows we can\nbasically perform any kind of\ntransactions here so this one basically\ntells me what is the data type so here\nwe see scientist id and this clearly\ntells me this is an integer however we\nwill not want to do any kind of\ncomputations here so\nwe can as well change this so i can just\ndo a right click and i can work on this\nparticular column what i can also do is\ni can just click on this\nand this tells me that you would want to\nchange it to\ndate time or you want to change it to\nsome number so i can just say string\nbecause we are not going to perform any\ncomputation here\nso on the id column so let's say\ntext\nand i'm changing it so it says replace\ncurrent add a new step so selected\ncolumn has an existing type conversion\nwould you like to replace the existing\nconversion or preserve the existing so i\nwill say replace current and now the\ndata type has been changed it is\nof a string and if you see this step has\ngot added here so it says that\nthe change type is the kind of\ntransformation we did here so that's\nfine now what we can also do is we have\nthe scientist name but we don't like the\ncolumn name here so it would be good to\nchange this\nso there is something called as\nremove or remove columns and so on so\nwhen you do a right click it gives you a\nlot of options in applying filters or\ndoing some transformation if i just\nclick on this one so what i can do is i\ncan look at the date time\nand\nlet's go here so we have\nan option which says do you want to\nchange the type now we could have done\nthat here or like i said you could\nchoose the time and do it you can just\nsay transform and how do you want to\nchange it so do you want to change it to\nuppercase well you can do that and\nchanges all the values of this one\nwhat i can do is i can again do a right\nclick and i can choose\nbasically if you would want to clean up\nthe data or if you would want to convert\nto lowercase you want to capitalize each\nword\nso let's choose that and if you see here\nthe steps are getting added now to undo\nany particular step if i just\ncancel this then i'm back to this if i\ncancel this i'm back to my original form\nso you can anytime undo your changes\nand you can basically work on this\nso\nwe are working on this particular column\nnow there are various other options that\nyou can look at so for example these are\nthis is some of my data but it does not\nhave much information it would be good\nto load some bigger data set and then\nuse these transformations\nor basically\nworking on changing the data types as i\nmentioned\nor if you would want to do a filtering\nand remove certain fields and only\nselect particular fields if that's what\nyou're interested\ndoing a right click where i want to\ncreate a copy of this and then basically\ni can\nuse that particular copy\nnow what i can also do is\ni can add column from examples i can\nduplicate column and then i can\nmake some changes to that so this is my\nduplicate column and say for example you\nwould want\nthis one to be changed so\nwe can\nsay remove duplicates we can basically\nif you are doing some kind of change you\nwant to change the format here you can\ndo that you can use for other things\nlike filling up and all that now i can\njust call it rename and let's say\num alias scientist name\nright and i can continue adding columns\nor i can do some transformations and\nonce you have done with these\ntransactions now this one if you see it\nshows as integer but is it an integer no\nthis is an date format so i can go for\nmodeling and change the formats what i\ncan also do is i can select this and it\nsays it's not a decimal\nit's not a fixed decimal it is date time\nit is date\nit is date time and time zone\nright and you can select any one of\nthese so for example let's make it date\nwhich\nmakes it more meaningful but then what\nhappens is when you do this it is going\nfor the default dates or the older dates\nso i don't like that\nso what we will have to do is we will\nhave to\nbasically transform this and\nhere we have transform you have change\ntype so you have date and time you have\ndate you have time so let's choose date\nand time and if you see here it gives me\nsome default timing based on these\nvalues which we do not like so again\nfilter it out but what we can do is we\ncan just\nmake sure that this is\nchanged or you want to make it a string\nbecause we are not going to do any\ncomputation here so i can keep it as\ndate but then if i have more fields like\nmonth and days and so on then you can do\nthat so here it also has\nthe option so when you have selected\nthis you have an option called transform\nand transpose sorry transform also has\nvarious options which allow you to work\non these do you want to do some\nscientific calculations do you want to\nwork on\nthe date field so as of now it is just\ninteger so we can use one of these we\ncan do a group by but\nobviously we don't have much data here\nso as of now let us retain this i can\njust change this to text and that's okay\nbecause we are going to look at this\nlater we can add more data and work on\nit so as of now once we have done all\nthese changes you can go back to\nsay home and here you have close and\napply and i can basically say close and\napply so the changes will be\napplied and then my new table which we\njust created by entering some random\ndata\nperforming some basic transformations\nwill be available so if you look into\nthis one\nso that's where my data is it shows me\nthe columns but there is no aggregated\ncolumn as such here you don't see any\nsummation mark you just see the field\nnames or the column names you see the\nvalues now obviously if you go into\nmodeling\nthere is no\nor there is no existence of a different\ntable which you can join these tables or\nyou can perform some transactions\ncome back to the data set so this looks\ngood and we have it here now obviously\nwe have not created any visualization\nbased on this which we can and we can\ncontinue working on it so here this is\nmy data set\nwhich is a small table where we have\ncreated some data and we can use it\nanytime\nnow let's work on a bigger data set and\nsee what kind of transformations we can\ndo we can then also see on modeling or\nbasically using some smarter ways of\nworking with the data\nso what we would want to do is we would\nwant to load some data here\nso let's go into\n[Music]\nsorry let's go into home let's go to get\ndata\nlet's use our old store data and i'm\ngoing to take the global superstore\nwhich is huge data set with\nall the countries and the products and\nthe sales which have happened\nand we can take this data but before\nloading it as i suggested earlier we\nshould basically transform the data we\nshould basically transform the data so\nthat you don't end up loading everything\nand you don't work on all the data i\nmean unless you really want to\nso here i will this excel sheet which\ni'm talking about has two different tabs\nwe have used it before so let's use\norders let's use returns\nand that basically shows me the data\nwhat we have so i can do a load but\nthat's not what we would want to do so\nyou can do a load and you can get all\nthe data but let's go to transform\nmake some basic transformations before\nwe load the data so our power\nbi editor allows us to work on this now\nhere we have\nit says this preview may be up to nine\ndays old\nso i can do a refresh i can select this\nand i say first thing is use first row\nas header because that's what i want\nso it is basically\nsetting the first row as header which\nlooks good\nand we have some order ids we have the\nreturned if the product was returned\nso let's look at the filter here so it\njust has\nyes values\nwhich we are looking at so\n[Music]\nit says list may be incomplete let's say\nload\nmore and let's see what are the filters\nhere so either there might be a product\nwhich is returned or it might be blank\nfield so that is chosen so that's fine\nwe have order id we have region which is\nbasically showing me different regions\nhere\nlet's look at orders and orders\nis again having your row id order id\norder date ship date ship mode so you\nhave quite a large amount of data here\nfor your\ndifferent countries now in earlier\nexample i chose united states and then i\nwas only focusing on the states and city\nin united states so we can do that now\ni can basically work on refresh so\nwhatever preview was stored in the\nmemory we are just refreshing it now\nhere we have this\nrow id and if you see the row id is an\ninteger obviously we will not be\nperforming any kind of computation here\nso\nhere\nyou don't have any row id but here we\nhave row id so let's make it\nfrom integer let's make it string\nand\ni'll say replace current so that's that\nlooks fine it's a row id which we will\nuse to search but we are not going to\nperform any computations unless you want\nto find on\nan average on row id or anything else\nnow you have order ids so\nwhat we can do is we can\nfilter some values\nwe can rename the field as we desired\nright so for example let's go in here\nand what we can do is let's go into\na customer id ship\nokay\nand here you have say state you have\nregion\nokay now at any point of time if i would\nwant to filter out the values the easier\noption is\nthat you can select on this one and here\nyou can do some text filtering\nokay or you can basically select the\nvalues from here so for example if i say\nlet's get rid of\nselect all\nwhat we will be interested in\nsay united states and uk that's the data\nwe want\nand then\ni can basically say okay\nso\nit is basically going to filter out the\ndata which is for united states and uk\nas of now now what we can also do is how\nabout doing some more filtering before\nwe basically work on this so let's go in\nhere and we are looking at united states\nand uk related data\nand let's look at\nit is sometimes good that you can\nbasically\nuh work on the data here so for example\ni go into orders now what i would want\nto do is i would want to look at\nthe fields\nokay\nand we want to we have not yet loaded\nthe data so if you look in the\nbackground i just have my scientists\nbecause we have not applied these\nchanges we have not loaded we are still\nin the transformation stage right now\nwhat we can do is let's go for\nso we can do\nsegment and all these kind of fields\ncan be used for grouping the data so we\nwill see that whenever you have a data\nset you would already know there are\ncertain fields which have repeated\nvalues which can be used to group the\ndata\nand we can do that we can\nchange\nany kind of values which are not\ngoing to be computed on so for example i\nhave postal code i can\nuse this but again we are not going to\nfind a postal code which is greater than\nsomething right so integer is not the\nvalid type let's change it to text\nokay\nand\nif for example\ni would want to\nlook at this\nso i have done some\nchanges here okay and this shows me null\nso for example let me just reword this\nback\nand let's make it\na whole number\nokay so there are certain\ncolumns or rows which do not have some\nvalues and we can basically get rid of\nthose values so as of now we can do a\nfiltering here\nso let's keep the postal code as integer\nor\nlet's\nchange it to text do a replace\ncontent\nand now what we will do is we'll scroll\nall the way right\nmight be i'm interested in\ntechnology category so that's what i'm\ninterested in so what i can do is here i\ncan do some filtering\nso i can basically choose\ntechnology now the easier way would be\nsince these are categories and there are\nonly three categories we really don't\nwant to go and apply text filters here\nbut if you had something like an\noffice supply\nand\noffice inventory\nthen you could have done some text\nfilters so let's not do some text\nfiltering here what we can do is i would\nbe interested in technology\nso that's the field i'm interested in so\nnow you are only having data which is\nrelated to technology\nokay and you have some product names so\nthis is where we want to do some kind of\nfiltering\nso we can rename the field we can select\nsome fields so let's for\nexample let's go for\nany of the field which i think might\nhave more entries here so for example\nlet's go for\ncanon wireless or canon image right so\nlet's go for product names\nand i will say let's\ngo here\nnow i could have done a transformation\nbut that's not what we want we want to\ndo some filtering so let's go to text\nfilter\nand here i can say begins with\ni can say ends with i can say contains\nso let's go for contains\nand it says enter a value here so\nyou would want to keep the rows where\nthe product name contains something and\nit gives you some suggestion\nright so where you are seeing in some\nvalues here so for example if i would\nhave selected this then it applies the\ncomplete thing but that's not what i\nwant so i will\nget rid of all this and i will say it\ncontains canon now i can go for advanced\nfiltering also\nokay\nwherein you can select advanced and then\nyou can give\ndifferent columns\nand\nwhat do they contain\nwhat kind of values you're looking for\nso you can do that but we will not go\nfor advanced in one step let's go for\nbasic and let's say okay\nand now i should get all the products\nwhich are\ncannon\nand you have different products so this\nis one kind of filtering i've done it\ntells me what is the category of this it\nis machines it is copiers\nit is obviously belonging to the\ntechnology category we are looking at\nthe market which is for this particular\ndata when you look at the country we are\nstill focusing on united states and\nunited kingdom that kind of data right\nso we have filtered the data we have\ndone some\nselection based on the data here and\nwhat i can do is i can then\nbasically\nrename a particular field so i can do\nthat i can say i'm interested in\nsales\nwhich is the data here\nwe can\nbasically look into the quantity so\nsales is something which we are\ninterested in but might be we are\ninterested in sales which are\nmore than a particular value i'm not\ninterested in lower amount of sales i\nwould want to look into united states\nand uk data but i am interested in sales\nor i am looking at\nif the discount percentage was something\nor if the profit was\nmore right so we can apply different\nkind of values here but\nwhat we can do is with these changes\nbecause you don't want to transform and\nmake changes all here\nyou want to make the changes once the\ndata set is uploaded so we have selected\nsome data\nwe have create done some transformations\nwe can basically break a particular\ncolumn into multiple columns if that's\nwhat we want if we see that we will do\nan aggregation based on year\nor we will do a aggregation based on the\ncountry or year and order id right so we\ncan break this data into multiple\ncolumns so we can do that but for now\nlet's do a close and apply\nand\nlet's apply this so that's going to\napply all these changes it's going to\nload my data but remember now we are\nhaving selective or selected data which\ngets loaded\nso that should get be available here so\nit takes time sometimes so you have to\nwait\nand then you can go ahead and check here\nso for example now i'm looking in tables\nlet's basically minimize this let's go\nfor orders and this is the data i have\nwhich obviously row id if you see\nso you have all the row ids and again\nagain you can do filtering here but this\nis where you have already loaded the\ndata the data is available and then you\ncan start working on the columns here so\nwe have this\nif you closely see we see this summation\nmark and this basically means that\nthese are my aggregated columns or these\nvalues are measures which can be used\nfor calculations so we can see that we\ncan create our own aggregations so we\ncan do that we can rename the field as\nwe have seen\nwe can filter out the data so we have\nall the fields showing up from orders\nand let's also look at the returns\nwhich basically has the columns the\norder id and your region\nso\nit basically shows the region here where\nwas the\nproduct returned from and we have this\ninformation so what we are doing is we\nwhen we were doing a text filter in the\nprevious example\nremember it was case sensitive\nokay and you have to take care of when\nyou're doing a text filter you have to\ngive a field which exactly matches as it\nexists in the content\nnow\nokay this is the data we have and let's\nlook at the order column right now what\nwe can do is we can do some quick\ntransformations here and we can\nbasically look for\nmore data here so\nlet's say we have\nsome filtering to be done\nnow\ni can do a filtering based on my\nuh\nproducts\nso we had all these products but now\nlet's do a filtering on product and then\nproducts you have copiers you have\nmachines\nso you have\nmainly two categories right and when you\nlook at machines it basically talks\nabout your pc\n[Music]\nsomething so let's look for machines and\nhere\nwe have\nbasically the copier fields which are\nmore\nso i can basically\ngo for filtering here\nand that's the data we have so we don't\nwant to really unselect any of these\nhere but what i'm doing is i'm saying\ntext filter and let's go into this one\nnow\nand let's say contains\nokay so i'm saying contains and then i\ncan basically say\nlet's say copier\nnow that's what i'm interested in\nand\nshow rows where product name contains\ncopier\nokay now you can give a and condition\nhere\nso\nif you would want a specific copier if\nyou are interested in okay let's also\nsay\ncontains and let's go for laser also\nlaser\nand let's say okay\nso you see the data gets filtered out\nhere and\nwe have the sales which we are seeing\nhere so let's go to sales and we will be\ninterested in anything above\n500 so let's go to sales\nlet's go for number filters let's say\ngreater than\nand i will say for example 500 oh sorry\n500\nokay\nand\nlet's say okay\nso that basically filters out the data\nand then\ni am also interested in quantity where i\nwould want\nthe quantity to be\nmore than\none or more than two so for example so\nlet's go in\nhere\nand you can basically choose what is the\nfilter you want so you can apply any\nnumber of filters now you have the\nfiltering here you can always click on\nthe filter and if you want you can just\ndo a clear filter and the filtering will\nbe gone so you have all the data right\nand\nthis is\nthe particular data we have and here i\nhave say for example\nproduct name now i can keep the filter\nbecause i'm interested only in these\nvalues or\ni can filter out so this tells me that\nwhen we did it and it is basically going\nfor laser and copier right so\nlet's say for example clear all filters\nthe thing is gone what we can do is\nlet's go here\ngo for text filters say contains and\nhere i will say\nit can be a copy here okay or\nso last time we did a and and i'll do it\ncontains laser\nso\nlet's choose this that gives me more\nentries so either the product name has\ncopier or it has laser\nit has the quantity it has the product\nname\nand we have all this detail here now\nwhat we can also do is we can do some\ntransformation\non the product id so for example you\nhave product id or order id so order id\nshows up as\nlooks like the country name\nthe year and then the order id so we can\nbasically\nsplit it up so i can select this and\nhere\ni have option of\nlet's go to home so when you have you\nhave selected this column so you have an\noption of transform data here so use the\npower query editor to connect prepare\nand transform the data so if you really\nwant to transform the data here if i\nbasically select this\nif i\njust where i click here\nnow here it just tells me do you want a\nnew column do you want to create a copy\nof this column\nokay you want to create copy table so\nthis is your transformed data what you\nhave and for example let's create a copy\ntable\nand let's come in here\nso\nyou should be able to see your\ncopy table now so let's go in\nand select this one\nand what you need to do here is creating\na copy of this or copy table\nwould not be the right option what we\ncan do is we can work on\ntransforming this rather than doing it\nfrom here so you have this option of\nadding a new column going for a new\nmeasure\nrenaming it right so that's\nokay but what we can do is select this\nparticular column let's do a home\nand first thing is let's go to transform\nso i want to transform the data now\nlet's select this one\nand it brings up your power editor again\nhere we were interested in orders so we\nare looking at\nour data here\nnow if you see my country's united\nstates and uk so you can confirm that if\nyou look at category it is technology\nproduct name has copier and laser has\nbeen selected so those things are\nretained so you have not lost any\nchanges as of now so this order id\ncolumn what we have now as i said you\ncan be doing a filtering okay you can\nselect this particular column and then\nyou have other things which can be used\nto transform here like you want to\nchange the data type you want to use\nfirst row as header you want to replace\nsome values\nokay you want to run some merge queries\nyou want to do some analytics so all\nthese options are here\nnow what we can do is while this column\nis selected i can do a right click now\nthere is an option called transform\nwhich is basically going to help me in\nchanging the data here okay now i can\nbasically\nduplicate the column so i really don't\nwant to work on this column itself but\nit would be good to have\na duplicate column on which we can work\non so i can do a split column here if i\nwould want to but let's create a\nduplicate column so let's say duplicate\ncolumn\nnow that gives me a duplicate column so\nwe can rename it later so now i will not\nwork on my original column but i'll work\non a duplicate column and what i'm going\nto do is i'm going to\nbasically transform or split this so\nagain do a right click\nnow you have a split by so we can say\nsplit by by delimiter or by number or by\ncharacters or by position so by\nlowercase and uppercase so you can do\nall of this so let's go for by delimiter\nnow if you see\nit basically identifies the delimiter\nwhich is hyphen or dash\nnow you can go for split at left most\nidentify right sorry left most delimiter\nright most each occurrence of delimiter\nand that's what we want to do you can\nlook into advanced options where it says\nsplit into columns\nso do you want to split that into\ncolumns do you want to split that into\nrows because that's more or less like\ndoing a group by and you can say number\nof columns to split into so we have here\n1 2 3 4 values so that looks good to me\nand\nlet's do\nsay for example if i choose 3\nso i can choose 3 and then split using\nspecial characters so you could do that\nso let's for example let's say okay\nand let's look at the data how it looks\nlike we can anytime delete the data we\ncan keep it the way we want right so\nwhat we did was\nwe created a copy of the column\nthen we did a split\nand\nwhat we have seen is we just have\nthree columns now if you see the fourth\nbit is gone fourth bit doesn't show up\nright because i just did a three\nas the\n[Music]\nresulting column so i have the order id\nokay and we can check if there is\nalready an order id column so we have\norder id but that has the complete order\nid year and the\nrelatively product id so you can see the\ncustomer id you can look at this one so\nit basically has\nyour order id and then let's look at\nthe fields here\nso we have\nthe product id which says t e c m a i'm\nlooking at the first one\n3700\nand\nthat has in no relation to the order id\nright so we can make sure that there is\nnothing which is\nconflicting with our entries now once\nthat is done so we have order id which\ncan be used to categorize the data\nyou have order id which is basically the\nyear\nokay and you have order id\nwhich is\nbasically having some more value now i\ncan keep this data\nas i want so i can\nbasically click on this i can go for\nrenaming and i can say let's say let's\ncall it\norder\nid\nand let's say\nids so let us\nin case there is\na particular column and you would want\nto look at so\njust give the name correctly now order\nids is fined so here we will also rename\nthis one so let's call it\norder\nhere and that's going to be order here\nso we can again change this to\nstring\nokay and here you have the order id so\nlet's rename this one\nand\ni have my\nlet's call\norder\nnumber\nright\nso we have we are seeing all the steps\nwhich we have added here we just split\nthe data based on the delimiter and we\nhave\nnow three new columns which have got\nadded to our existing data which was\nalready filtered\nand we have done some\nsplitting up of data by creating a\nduplicate and then renaming it right so\nif you\ngo and look at your transformations now\nif i would have done a split here\nstraight away\nthen my original column would be gone\nbut probably we want the original column\nbecause sometimes you may want to search\norder id which i consolidated\ninformation sometimes you may want to\nsegregate it based on\nyear right now we have the year field or\norder date field here you have the ship\ndate right but then might be you want to\njust aggregate based on year you don't\nwant to really spend time in aggregating\nor extracting the month and day and so\non so my these three columns can be\nuseful now what i can also do is i can\nmerge the columns if i want so we have\nsplit the columns but what i can do is i\ncan say select\nselect\nselect\nso using your control and now do a right\nclick so you should have an option\ncalled merge columns right now this is\nsomething which is\nwe would want to\nmerge\nso let's say merge columns and let's say\ndo you want to keep a separator so yes i\nwant to keep a separator but might be\nthis time i will give my separator is a\ncolon\nand then what is the merge column name\nyou want to create so let's call it\nsomething like\norder\nokay\nuh\nyear\nand then let's call it\nnum\nright so sometimes renaming the fields\nto a name which makes more sense or\nbased on your naming convention is good\nso let's do a merge\nand\nnow what i have done is i have done\nmerging of those columns\nso\ni split the data i merge the columns\nand now if you see my\nthe columns which i had created those\ncolumns are gone because you did a merge\nyou did a merge and now you have the\nfields which are either\nearlier you had\nsomething which is\nseparated by\na\nhyphen and here you have\nsomething which is separated by colon\nright now anytime if you want you can\nunmerge this by removing this step right\nand you can get rid of this merge column\nso if for example i would do that\nso\ni have my data back\nright i have my data back so what we\ncould have done is we can select this\nokay and then what we can do is like\nwhat we did earlier so you can\nbasically\ngo for\nremoving the columns\nokay you can do a merge column\nokay\nyou can select one by one and create\nduplicate of those and then you can\nmerge them right so all the possible\noptions are there so you can the best\noption would be to create a duplicate of\nthese columns and then basically merge\nthem as per your convenience so might be\nyou can say order id is an order number\nis the pairing what you want\nhere is something which you don't want\nright because we already have the date\nfield so i can basically say remove\nand this one is gone now i will select\nthis and this\nand let's go for merge columns and i\nwant to give a separator which is\nmight be without the ear and you have\nspace\nor you can go for custom like earlier we\nhad\ngive a\nsymbol\nand then what do you want to call it so\nlet's say order\nspecs\nokay\nright so this makes more meaning because\nwe already have the date field so why do\ni want the year into my order id so i\ncan always be doing a segregation now\nbased on order specs\nright now this is some simple\ntransformations what we are doing here\nwe are seeing the\ndata which we have\nokay now what i can do is i can\nbasically first apply these changes\nso that all my changes what i have done\nare applied\nright now once these changes are done we\ncan basically go ahead and\nsave this file\nso i can just say save i can go for save\nas i have different other options so\nif you would want to\nperform keep performing your\ntransformation then you can just do this\nyou can add a column you can view the\ndata so for now our transformations are\ngood enough and what we can do is we can\nbasically\ngo back to home we can do a close and\napply and we will be back to\nour data set which has been modified so\nwe can see\nif the data what we have has been\ntransformed\nso we have order specs here that's good\nwe did not do any filtering or\nwe have the filter left here which\nbasically tells me that there are these\ndifferent fields we have not removed\nthem but what we are doing is we are\njust applying a filter to choose copiers\nand laser printers\nso that's what we have here\nand this is good enough now what i can\ndo is once this is done\ni can basically save it\nso i would want to call it some kind of\nreport if you would want to create okay\nso let's call it\nas uh\nlet's say second\nreport\nand here i will say\ncountry\nand\ntechnology\nspecific info\nlet's save it\nand now basically i have saved my data\nso what you can do is you can go for\ncreating other report or basically\nhaving this information published if\nthat's what you want to do if you want\nto go for visualization because right\nnow what we are seeing is we have lot of\ndata here we have lot of data here it\nshows me there are these\ntables or data sets which we have worked\non that shows me\nhere in the models but there is no\nrelationship with them\nif you go into visualization then you\ndon't have\nany option or you have not created any\nvisualizations based on this data but if\nyou go here\nnow based on the data what we\ntransformed if you see\nwe\nhave order specs\nright now that's what we chose\nwe basically have other fields so you\nhave ship date you have aggregated\ncolumns which can be used for\nvisualizing and we can work on this\nso i can come back here and what i would\nbe interested in\nis this data set is fine but i want to\ndo some\ngrouping i want to\nbasically\nhave some selective data in this\nand for that what i can do is\nlet's go for ship mode now this is\nsomething what we have\nso\nwe are in this\ndata field\nnow we have this transform so let's go\nback to transform again\nand let's choose our orders\nso that's the data we have\nand now if you see here this is\nyou know huge amount of data what we\nwant is we want to group them based on\nthe shipping mode\nso here you have a option called group\nby so i can select this\ni can go in here i can basically work on\nokay get rid of duplicate values but\nthat's not what we want to do you want\nto do a group by so as i said you can do\na group by from here or you can choose\nfrom the transform option above and you\ncan do a group by so let's do a group by\nnow\nhow do you want to group the data so i'm\nsaying i want to group the data here\nbased on shipping mode\nor\nwhich is the other column you want to\nuse to do a group by so let's go for\nshipping mode\nand what is the new column name\nright so we want to basically find out\nthat you want to go for ship mode but\nthat's not enough i mean i can do a ship\nmode and i can do a grouping buy but you\nwant to just count the rows no that's\nnot what we want to do so let's go to\nadvanced so ship mode is fine so that's\nyour grouping right but then what we\nalso want to do is we want to do a\ngrouping based on\nsay sales so here for example let's go\nfor sales\nokay\nand what should we call this so might be\nwe can say\nshipment\nwise\nsales whatever you would want to call\nso you can basically\nget\nthe operation do you want to really\ncount the rows no we want to basically\ndo a summing or we want to might be find\nout an average price right so let's do a\nsum\nokay\nand here\ni would want to do a summing based on\nsay for example\nsales\nso this is what i'm going to use for\ngetting a count of the sales now\ngrouping by might be we will change this\ninstead of\n[Music]\ninstead of sales we are using a ship\nmode what we can also do is let's go for\na segment\nand that would be valid grouping so it\nwill take a combination of ship mode\nsegmenting group the data based on that\nand then get me the sales which is\nwhich is basically let's call it\nshipment wise sales\nso it gets a sum so let's do a\nokay\nand\nthat's my more relevant data which i'm\nlooking at so i'm looking at the ship\nmode i'm looking at what is the segment\nand then i'm looking at what is the\ntotal sales there i'm looking at\nagain the ship mode standard and home\noffice so always remember when you are\nchoosing multiple fields or multiple\ncolumns for grouping by\nyou are basically having\na combination of two fields so that has\nto be unique and your grouping is done\nbased on that so now you are looking at\nthe sales wise and this is something as\nan important information what we have\nso we have done some transformation\nand what you can do is\nyou can use\nother ways like you can use pivot to get\nindividual values from it you can run on\nmerge queries which is\nbasically running some merge queries and\nmerge the query with another query in\nthis workbook if you have so you can go\nfor this now i can basically go for\napply and close\nso just to add to the group by step what\nwe did was if you see here i have\nremoved the group by filter which we\njust did a couple of minutes back and\nwhat i have done is instead of\ntransforming your complete data set\nyou can basically create a copy of it so\nfor example i can just do a copy and\nthen i can come here and do a paste and\ni have done that and i'm calling it\norder summarized but this is my complete\ndata now what we will do here is we will\nbasically go ahead and do a grouping by\nagain like what we did earlier based on\nyour shipment\nbased on your segment\nand\nbased on the sales so that's what we are\nlooking for so let's go for the ship\nmode and\nwe go for group by\nand here you would want to go for\nadvanced to ship mode\nand this one i will go for segment\nso that's fine now we want the new\ncolumn name so let's say\nshipment\nwise sales\nso i want to do a summing not the\ncounting of rows and i want to do a\nsummation based on sales like what we\ndid earlier and then you say okay\nand that basically\ngives you the data here\nnow what we have is we have the\nresultant data based on the data which\nis coming in from here we did the same\nthing just one minute back\nbut we worked on the original data set\nso what i did was i created a copy and\nnow i'm working on this one so i'll say\nclose and apply\nand now we are back to\nour\ndesktop\nso it is applying these changes where we\nhave done some transformations we have\ndone some grouping by\nand what we can do is\nonce we have the data here we can\nanytime look at our data sets or tables\nso this is my original one\nif you see now i have order summarized i\ncan just pull out this information\ni basically have my\nreturns which we have not really touched\nand we have the scientists so we have\nall the four data sets here\nnow what we can also do is\nlet's look into order summarized and we\njust have this data here so\nthis is fine and you can continue\nworking on this you can basically\nmerge columns from two different data\nsets\nand then you can get\nthe merged column\nand you can rename it so you can\nobviously do that you can basically do a\nuncheck\nwhenever you're working on these data\nsets so what you can do is\nif you would want to work on\ntransforming for example let's go back\nhere\nand say i want to do\nsome transformation on it so how did we\ndo it we just did a transform\nand\nyou can go back to transform\nso you have this data here and\nthe data what you have you might be\ninterested in transforming this into\nsomething else\nand then\nyou don't want to\nmaybe load this data so you have this\noption where you are selecting orders\nand then you have something called as\nenable load which can be unchecked so\nwhen you do a uncheck what will happen\nis whatever changes you perform\nonly those changes related data set will\nbe loaded\nand they will still be available but\nthis will not affect your\nit will not affect your original one so\nfor example let's say copy\nand let's go in here i will do a paste\nlet's say orders\noh i did a paste i need to\nrename this\nso let's do a renaming let's say orders\nand here\ni will say summarized\nand i will say us\nso i'm renaming it now let that get\nloaded\nwe can perform some transformations on\nit so i have here\nthere's my country so let's look for\ncountry\nyeah\nand let's look for country so here i\nwill go for only united states\nokay that's what i'm interested in\nand then\ni can choose well i am interested in\njust central u.s\nso i can basically go for\njust the central u.s and i can get rid\nof all of these\nso now i should have only central u.s\ndata\nand this is fine and this is the data\nmight be we are focusing on right now\nfor doing some visualization might be\nlooking at sales\nmight be looking at the product names so\nyou have the product name now remember\nyou don't see any filters here right\nbecause the filters are\ncoming from the resultant set and your\ntransformation so\nif you have any filters you would be\nseeing in the top row now this is the\ndata we have\nlet's uh\nlet's not restrict it to region region\nwould then reduce my data but that's\ngood enough\nfor us i can just say no\ni'm clearing off this filter\ni'm still looking at united states but i\nwant to look at all the regions yeah\nwhatever we would be interested in\ncategory\nand that's anyways chosen as technology\nwhich we had chosen when we were loading\nthe data\nwe have copiers in machines\nright and\nwe can basically keep this now\nthis is fine i can apply the changes\ni can apply the changes based on this\none\nand what i can do is i can just say for\nnow apply\nso that's going to apply all the changes\nwhich you have done in orders or summary\nor the new one right and what i can do\nis now i can choose order and i can say\ndon't enable this in load\nso it says disabling load will remove\nthe table from the report and any\nvisuals that use its columns will be\nbroken we are not creating any visuals\nas of now the table will be removed so\nthat's fine\nand now i will say close and apply\nso what happens is you are loading the\ndata based on the changes\nokay now you have your\norder summarized you have returns you\nhave scientist but you basically do not\nhave orders anymore\nso that was not loaded so i only have\nthis one\ni only have this one\nand\nyou have returns you have scientists you\ndon't have the orders column right now\nthat particular\ndata set was not loaded at all because\nwe did not\nchoose that to be loaded right now while\ni'm in this\norders\nwhich is\nlet's see here\nand actually you can drag in yeah\nso you have order summary and this has\nbasically\nkind of data which i'm looking for so i\nreally don't need the\norders table so you can do it in steps\nand you can aggregate this you can have\naggregated data you can have all the\ndata which is filtered transformed\ngrouped by\nand then basically just load it and the\noriginal data set which you used that's\nno more\nbeing loaded here now at any point of\ntime if i really want\ni can go back to transform data and\nremember it is still here it is still\nhere it's not gone right so you can\nbasically select this and you can say\nenable load and you will have the data\nback which you can continue working on\nright so these are some quick\ntransformations which really help us\nin\nworking on the datum now obviously if\nyou have data you want to perform some\nleft joins right joins\nyou have inner joins outer joins so you\ncan always do that you can take two\ndifferent data sets might be i'm\ninterested in taking the\norders summarized which talks about\nstandard class consumer shipment wise\nsales\nand here if i look at order summary i\nhave other details but the thing is we\nneed to make sure that these have the\nvalues\nthese have the values say for example\nthe segment column here\nand the segment column here can really\nbe used to join these two tables so if i\ncreate a relationship\nor\nif i create a join i can basically merge\nthe data\nso this is how you work on data we will\nalso see some more examples on\nmight be modeling the data using some\nexpressions to work on the data so we\nalready looked at creating a report\nselecting particular fields\nand then publishing the report onto your\npower bi service now this is the report\nwhich we had created which says state\norder id sales and then i also added\nthis returned field and that was\nbasically by creating a relationship\nbetween order and returns which we can\nalso have a look in model so this is the\nrelationship which is created if you\njust place your cursor here it tells me\nthat we have a relationship between\norder id of returns\nand order id of orders and that\nbasically allows me to join the data\nbring it in my one report now this is\nbasically your data sources you can look\nat and if you click on your\nvisualization so that shows you your\nreport now what we can also do is we can\nmake it interesting now we would not\nwant to\nscroll through the fields to see\nwherever or what was the\norder or what was the order id which was\nreturned\nnow i can do a sorting i can filter out\nwhat i can also do is i can use this\noption which shows slicer here and that\nbasically allows me to work with this\ndata so we have this\nreport here and basically as i said you\ncan click in here it shows the data now\nwhat i can do is i would want to filter\nout information or slice the information\nusing your returned\neither being yes or\nhaving a field which has no value how do\nwe do that so basically i can drag and\ndrop the returned\nhere as a field which comes from returns\nnow that basically shows me only the\nvalue as yes but i do know that there is\nthere are some fields which are blank\nnow how do i add filter to this so i can\nclick on this one\nand\nthen i can click on slicer now once that\ndoes so it basically pulls out all the\ndifferent values so you have either yes\nor you have the blank field for returned\nso what we can do is we can select yes\nyou will see only\nthe orders and their ids and sales where\nthe products were returned so that gives\nme hundred eight thousand one one eight\nand i can select blank so that will\nbasically get me\nall the orders or products which were\nnot returned now this is a simple way\nwhen i can add a filter to or a slicer\nto my report to basically\ngive\nviewers a choice of\nselecting different fields and you can\nadd any number of slicers you can\nbasically say\ni would want particular kind of\ninformation so for example if i go into\norders and we know we have the state now\ni do have the state information here and\nbasically i can\nif i would be interested i could filter\nthis out in my report itself i can sort\nit\ni can look it in a different order what\ni can also do is how about\nbringing in state here and basically\ndragging it here\nso that gives me the state option it is\ngiving me a visual\nwhich is basically\ngiving me a geographic location of all\nthese points so yes that can be good\nwhat i can also do is i can keep this\nwhich basically shows me the state\nmap\nmight be it can be useful you can zoom\nin you can zoom out you can look at\nspecific information here you can drag\nand drop here so that's fine what i can\nalso do is i can\nagain take the state\nand bring it here\nand that\nbasically can be instead of my map i can\ngo for slicer so that gives me all the\nvalues here and which basically allows\nusers to choose the fields or the states\nwhich you would be interested in looking\nat so for example if somebody is\ninterested in looking at the data for\ngeorgia just select this one and you see\nthe map automatically shows you where in\nthe map that's the place and it shows me\nall the sales for georgia state now i\ncan also basically select yes and that\nshows me which were the orders which\nwere basically returned so that gives me\na quick overview of statewise what is\nthe geographical location\nif the orders were returned or maybe i\ncan just click on blank and it shows me\nthe non-returned orders\ni can again go here and uncheck the\ngeorgie option and that shows me all the\nstates now once you have done this this\nlooks like a comprehensive report which\ncan be useful for the viewers for your\nmanagement team and so on so we can just\ndo a safe and that basically is saving\nmy report so i have this report now what\nif i publish this report\nso i can just do a publish\nand when i publish it says okay\nworkspace so let's say select\nand then it says replacing this\ndata set may impact two reports you\nalready have a data set named by this\none view the impact i would say replace\nor i will say\nview impact so that basically takes me\nto the power bi service because\nsometimes we may have some reports which\nwe have already uploaded and updating an\nexisting report might basically affect\nmy existing report so it basically shows\nme the impact analysis it shows me one\nworkspace there are two reports there\nthey have not been added to dashboard\nbut these are the ones which will get\nmodified so let's for example\nas of now go ahead here and let's look\ninto my power bi so go back to your\ndesktop and i'll say no i don't want to\nreplace so click on cancel so i do not\nwant to publish it or it might be what i\ncan do is\ni can try saving it as a different\nreport so let's say save as\nand now i will basically say\nadditional\nfilters\nokay let's save it so now you see the\nname on the top changes to additional\nfilters and now it's\nsaved to publish this\nand now i can go ahead and publish it\nselect your workspace\nand basically it says this is the report\nbeing published with our additional\nfilters with a map which gives a\ngeographical\nuh area showing us the information and\nthen basically what i can do is once it\nis done i can look into my power bi\nservice like we did earlier you can do a\nfiltering\nwe can basically query this data we can\nshare it with other users who might be\ninterested in looking at this particular\ndata now this says it is done so it says\nget quick insights and might be it's a\ngood an option to\nlook into what kind of insights it's it\ngives you so click on that\nsee the beauty of power bi where it\ntries to search for\nany kind of insights which it can gather\nfrom the kind of report which you have\nbuilt\nnow once the insights are ready it will\nlet you know what we can also do is\nwe can come in here click on\nview data set\nso you see now it shows your additional\nfilters\nand here you have\noption\nwhere it should be showing your report\nso let's say view\nand view is fine\nso\nand if it doesn't show up\nsometimes it might be taking time for\nrefreshing so you can always go here and\nthen you can click on your report\nand that should get populated\nso this is the report these are the\nfilters which i have\ngives me an option of choosing all the\nstates\nand basically allows me to edit the\nreport and\nlook at all the information here\nmeanwhile we can see here it is still\ntrying to gather some insights from the\ndata and now you see there are some\ninsights here so it says sales which is\ncoming up\nand a subset of your data was analyzed\nand the following insights were found so\nyou're looking at sales by\nship mode so it says standard class\nsecond class first class and same day so\nthere were different shipping modes in\nour data and that's what it shows me the\nsales which one had the majority it\nshows me the profit so which city or\nstate had\nmore profit so new york city has\nnoticeable more profits here\naverage by shipping cost by sub\ncategories so there are these different\nsub categories which we can look at such\nas copiers and machines have noticeably\nmore shipping cost\nprofit by product name\nand\nyou can basically look at the row id and\nquantity so this is where you're looking\nat a regression analysis you're looking\nat row id and quantity so there is a\ncorrelation between row id and quantity\nso these are two different variables or\nfields which are related\nyou're looking row id by category\nrow id so it says\ncalifornia has noticeably more row ids\nsales\nyour profit count of region and count of\nreturns so there is a correlation again\nbetween two different variables\naverage of shipping cost now we would\nhave taken a lot of time building all\nthese visualizations\nbut power bi has already helped you in\ngathering all these insights and then\nyou can basically select which one of\nthese is what you are interested in you\ncan focus and look for more information\nbased on all the fields it has given you\ngood amount of insights which will help\nanyone who is looking at this particular\nreport\nso that's your quick insights here\nand\nwe have this information\nnow\nonce you have this information this is\nbasically\nwhere you have your focus mode so it\nsays subset of your data was analyzed\nfollowing insights were found you can\nbasically say download\nand\nhere you have other options which allow\nyou to work with your power bi so let's\nlook at this one so this is where we\nhave our report\nand\nwe can continue exploring it more\none more interesting feature which power\nbi has other than\nhaving your insights ready to use\nwhich is basically in your workspace and\nyou can basically use these insights\nwhat we are looking at various options\nhere\nand basically you have this option where\nit says spin the visual if you are\ninterested in a particular\ninsight you can always spin it which you\ncan always go back and look into what\nyou can also do is you can\nalso click on edit report here now\nthat's a report which has already been\npublished\nto\nyour power bi service not yet shared but\nthat can be shared or that can be\nsubscribed now once you click on edit\nreport\nit has option of reading view mobile\nlayout\nyou have basically an option which says\nbasically\noptions for navigating through the data\nset\nyou can go for\nhow visuals on the canvas interact with\neach other you have all these options\nand one of the good options is ask a\nquestion so you can always click on ask\na question and that basically\nsays\nsome suggestions now you can open this\nand it says\nokay ask a question about your data try\none of these to get started what is the\naverage sale\nsort orders by order date sort orders by\nproduct id\nhow many ship modes are there compare\nquantity and discount so do not worry\nthat\nyour report has\nonly four fields so it has state order\nid sales and returned\nwith some filters but what about\nyou looking at how many ship modes are\nthere so it is already looking at your\ndata so if you click on this one here\nand you can see what are the different\nfields what we have and you have ship\ndate and ship mode so this is one of the\nfields which it is showing you to ask a\nquestion now what you can do is you can\nsay how many ship modes are there let's\nclick on that\nlet's ask this question it says four\nship modes and do you want to add this\nto report yes you can you can let it be\nas it is so you can basically keep this\nquestion here\nand here you have an option the visual\nis showing number of ship modes when you\nplace your cursor here\nif you\nsee here turn this qna result into a\nstandard visual\nand let's do that\nand basically it is saying\nnumber of ship modes\nright so now that's the power of\nyour bi\npower bi which has basically allowed you\nto ask a question and quickly\nadd a visual to your report now what we\ncan do\nis we can basically save this\nor you can say save as and given a\ndifferent name so might be i'll just say\nsave because i would want to have this\ninformation and the report is saved so\nin this way you can basically not only\ncreate smart visuals\nyou can not only relate\ndifferent data sources using data models\nor relationships you can add maps you\ncan add filters you can add quick\nquestions\nyou can basically just go here and say\nfor example you would want to\nask a different question now we see the\nfields here how about looking at the\nshipping cost right so here i can say\num\nwhat is the\nhighest\nshipping\ncost and that shows me some suggestions\nlet's select that and that shows me the\nvalue\nwhich is great\nand i can keep it as it is i can\nbasically convert this to a visual i may\nwant to keep the question because might\nbe this question was asked and\nyou would want to see the result here\nmight be you can move this somewhere\nhere\nand that gives me some kind of question\nwhich was asked and we can do a save\nand that's my report which has been\nsaved\nin my bi service the data set is still\nthere you can basically go ahead and\nshare this\nlet's take a look at some of the\nbenefits of tableau as your business\nintelligence tool so why would we use\ntableau it can be connected to 40\ndifferent data sources the more data\nsources it can connect to it means that\nyou are more likely to get direct access\nto your data it can build interactive\ndashboards with just a few clicks which\ncan help you quickly understand your\ndata and it lets you see your outliers\nthere's also simple analytics built\nright into tableau such as trends and\nforecasting that can help you understand\nyour data on a deeper level tableau has\nbeen a leader in the gartner magic\nquadrant for the last six years and that\nincludes 2018. here we will take a look\nat an overview of the products offered\nby tableau so we have tableau desktop\nwhich is where you do all of your\ndevelopment this is where you connect to\nand build visualizations and dashboards\ntoday we'll be using tableau public\nwhich is a free version of tableau\ndesktop but with some limitations such\nas having no r integration and it can\nonly support up to a million rows of\ndata also any data published here is\nmade public so you can't use this for\nprivate company information then there's\na new tool called tableau prep where you\ncan prepare your data by seeing it\nvisually before you connect and build\nreports there's also tableau online\nwhich is a cloud-hosted version of\ntableau server a place where you can\npublish your dashboards and it enables\nyou to share your dashboards in a secure\nway tableau server has an option to be\non premises so let's just do a quick\ncomparison between building a\nvisualization in excel and building one\nin tableau\nokay so here we have an excel file full\nof data that we will soon connect to and\nuse for some of our demonstration\npurposes\nand you can see that we have information\nabout orders if we wanted to find out\nthe quantity sold and the sum of sales\nfor each region we could do that by\ncreating a pivot table so we'll make it\ni selected my cells we'll make it in a\nnew worksheet\nand here we have the beginnings of a\npivot chart\nand we can grab region and pull it into\nour columns\nand then we'll grab\nsales\nand put it into values\nand then we also want to look at\nquantity and put that into values and\nit's automatically summing up sales and\nquantity but you can choose if you want\nit to be some or not and then we'll take\nour values and put it on rows so that we\ncan see\nsales and quantity\none on top of the other and that's the\nbasics of a pivot chart now let's do a\nsimilar thing in tableau\nokay so we have our connection to the\ndata and tableau automatically splits\nout the dimensions from the measures\nwe'll go into more depth on that later\nbut we can come and grab region and put\nit onto columns\nand we get a similar thing maybe a\nlittle nicer formatted and then we can\ncome and put quantity\nthere\nif we want to add sales to it we can\ndouble click on sales and we'll have\nquantity and sales one on top of the\nother we can put sales on top by\ndragging quantity\ndown in that box we also have this show\nme dialog box which allows you to\nsee what visualizations you could build\nusing what's already on the screen or\nthe things that you have selected so\nright now we could quickly switch it to\nbar charts and now we can see quantity\nand sales across our region with bar\ncharts or we could switch it to stacked\nbars\nand we can see our quantity across the\nregions if you close that we can see our\nlegend over here and then our sales\nacross the region\nso in tableau we have a lot of really\nquick flexibility to turn just text into\na visualization\nso in summary we can see a side by side\nof what we made using pivot tables in\nexcel and what we made in a similar\namount of time in tableau let's get\nstarted with the tableau installation as\nfor requirements you need windows 7 or\nlater or you need your mac operating\nsystem to be 10.11 or later here are\nsome of the browsers you can use to\ninstall tableau we will be installing\ntableau public today and to do that you\njust google tableau public download and\nclick on that first link and then you\nput in your email address and click\ndownload the app so\nlet's just\nlook up tableau public download\nand it's this first one you can click\ndownload now\nit takes you to the tableau public page\nwhere you can click sign in and create\nan account free\nthis gives you a place to save the\nvisualizations you make but keep in mind\nanything you save on tableau public is\npublic and then you come here and you\nenter your email address and click\ndownload the app and it should give you\nexecutable file\nthat you will download\nand once it's downloaded\nyou should be able to open tableau\npublic so let's go take a look at the\ntableau public opening page\nso this is what tableau public looks\nlike when you first open it on your left\nyou have the different things you can\nconnect to\nthis is more limited in tableau public\nthan it is in tableau desktop so if you\ninvest in tableau desktop you have\nmany many things you can connect to you\ncan also connect to data by clicking\nthis drop down connect data piece that's\nespecially useful when you've already\nstarted your visualization then we have\nthis central portion called open this is\nwhere anything that you have opened up\npreviously will show up you can also\nclick open from tableau public and when\nyou have\nmy connections timed out so i need to\nlog in\nbut when you log in\nit says no workbook found try publishing\nfirst this is where you'll see all of\nyour published tableau public dashboards\nover here we have discover and it has\nsome how-to videos\nvisualization of the day\nwhich is where people who have made\ntableau public visualizations get\nrecognized for their skill and you get\nsome pretty cool ideas when you look\nthere so let's get started by connecting\nto a data source we'll click microsoft\nexcel and we'll choose our excel file\nand open it up and this is our data\nsource page this shows you the sheets on\nthe excel file\nand allows you to drag them in so that\nyou can see the data show up this gives\nyou a preview of what your data will\nlook like\nyou can see the tableau is starting to\nclassify our fields so anything that has\nabc on it\nshows that that's a column that has\nstrings in it we also have a globe which\nis where tableau has recognized these\nvalues to be geographical\nso we have\nstate and it's recognized that it\ncontains states it bases it on\nthe keywords that it stores to identify\nif it's geographical and so it takes a\nlook and you've named it city and it\nknows that city is geographical we also\nhave the calendar symbol where it's\nrecognized that it's a date field and we\nalso have row id that shows up with the\nhashtag and i recognize that's a number\nso now that we have our data source\npulled in we can come here and hit sheet\nwhich is where you start to build your\nvisualization let's take a look at all\nthe different pieces of this before we\ngo any further we have the data that\nwe're connected to up here\nis our orders sheet from the sample\nsuperstore excel sheet we have\ndimensions on top and measures on bottom\nthese are where we're going to get the\nfields to drag and drop here we have our\ncards we'll look more in depth at our\ncards in a moment and these are our\nshelves the column shelf and the row\nshelf\nwhere you can drag things in to make\nchanges happen in the visualization\ncenter we have our show me tabs where\nyou can see we took a brief look at this\nearlier but you can see all the\ndifferent visualizations you can build\nhere\na neat thing about show me is that when\nyou hover\nit'll tell you what types of\nfields you need to build it so\nfor a symbol map try one geographical\nfield\nzero or more dimensions or zero to two\nmeasures and that's how you can build a\ngeographical symbol map\nand when you're done with show me you\njust close it\nlet's take a look here at our sheets so\nwe have sheet one and sheet two a sheet\nis basically just one visualization at a\ntime\nlet's get rid of the extra sheet we have\na dashboard which is where you can pull\nmultiple sheets on to show multiple\nvisualizations at one time\nand then we have what's called the story\nwhich allows you to show\na sequence of visualizations so that you\ncan tell a story\nperfect okay so we saw that tableau is\ncategorizing\nour different fields\nand it is also giving it a role\nso we have dimensions on top and\nmeasures on bottom\ndimensions contain descriptive values\nsuch as names dates and geographical\ndata you can use dimensions to reveal\ndetails in your data that is qualitative\ndetails we also have measures which\ncontain numeric quantitative values that\nyou can measure measures can be\naggregated and when you drag a measure\nonto the view tableau will apply an\naggregation to that measure it's sum by\ndefault\nso let's show this by building what we\nbuilt before\nwe'll grab region and we'll see its four\ndistinct\nvalues as a dimension\nand then we'll double click on quantity\nand we can see the\nnumbers here the measures and you can\nsee here that it is the sum of quantity\nand now we can also double click on\nsales and we can see quantity and sales\nto discuss a little bit more about\ndimensions and measures you can see that\nin general measures are numbers and\ndimensions are not but sometimes like\nrow id it is a number now why would we\nhave a number up here instead of in the\nmeasures so you can tell the difference\nbetween number whether it should be in\nmeasures or it should be in dimensions\nbased on whether you'll need to do any\ncalculations on it or if you would want\nto be able to aggregate it at some time\nso for\nsales\nif you have\nseveral orders in a day\nyou might want to know what the sum of\nthose sales are\nbut if you have several orders in the\nday\nand they're on rows 2 3 4 and 5 you\nmight not want to know the sum of the\nrows so tableau is smart enough that\nwhen it sees id it knows that it belongs\nup in the dimensions now you can switch\nso if row id was actually something you\nwould want to aggregate for some reason\nyou can drag it down to the measures and\nadd it down there\nbut in our case row id isn't something\nthat you want to sum or average can you\nthink of any other numbers that might\nnot show up as a measure that should be\na dimension comment below with your\nanswers as we discussed before\ndimensions are on top measures are on\nbottom and you can see that blue is\nassociated with dimensions and green is\nassociated with measures but it's a\nlittle bit more complicated than that so\ndimensions are qualitative and measures\nare quantitative but blue means we want\nour label to be discrete and green means\nwe want our label to be continuous let's\nmake a new sheet and make a\nvisualization to kind of show this so we\ncan bring on quantity and we're going to\nuse it as a dimension but you can see\neven when it's a dimension you can\nchoose continuous or discrete so right\nnow it's a dimension but it's green a\nlittle bit different than what you might\nexpect and then we'll do sales so now we\ncan see over the different quantities\nwhat our sales was yeah has been for\nthis last this period of time that we're\nlooking at i believe it's four years so\nfor when people bought three items the\ntotal sales was\nthat number and you can see that this is\nan axis so it's from 1 to 15. now if we\nchange it from continuous to discrete\nyou can see that 1 is a label 2 is a\nlabel and it's not an axis ranging from\n1 to it doesn't even have 15 because\nthere are no values under 15. these are\njust individual labels so we go back\nit's green again and you can see that\nit's an axis so we have two greens on\nhere so we have two axes and change it\nback to discrete and now we have one\naxes and one set of individual labels so\nlet's go back to our sheet three we have\nall of these different\nsales by the different quantity numbers\nand up here we have our sorting when you\nhover it tells you what kind of sorting\nis going to happen so we could sort\nquantity descending by sales so we can\nsee that when they buy three things we\nhave the highest sales\nyou can do the opposite\nwhere it's the lowest\nto the highest\nnumber of sales you can also do sorting\nmore in depth by clicking on the\nquantity and right clicking sort so we\ncould just sort by\ndescending or ascending or by sales or\nalphabetic\nwhich is\nnot what we want\nyou can choose the field or you can\nmanually change your sorting here and\nnow we're back to what we had at the\nbeginning now that we've had an overview\nof how tableau works let's go into a\nlittle more detail\ntableau is very much built on the\npremise of drag and drop\nso let's build a simple visualization\nand talk about\nwhat each of these shelves and marks\ncards specifically do\nso we're going to make a simple chart\nwhich is average sales by region\nso we know we want\nsales\non\nlet's do sales on\nrows now for rows and for metrics since\nthis is continuous like we talked about\nbefore it's making an axes\nfor our sales\nwe also can drag\nregion\nonto columns and it makes one column per\nregion so that's how it works with\ndimensions if you\npull a dimension onto columns you're\nsaying i want one\nblank per column i want one region per\ncolumn so if you wanted to do it by\ninstead of region\nif you want to remove something from a\nvisualization you just pull it back off\nor you can hit undo or control z\ntableau has the benefit of having\nunlimited undos so let's say we wanted\nto bring on city let's say we want one\ncolumn per\ncity and that's what you get and there's\na lot of cities\nso that's what it looks like let's take\ncity back off i want one column per\nregion\nand for\nsales\ni want my rose axes\nto show me where sales are great\nnow let's say we want to adjust the\ncolor of these bars you can click on\ncolor and you can select any of them so\nlet's pick this nice blue\nor we can pick an orange\nand that's how you can determine\nthe color\nbut if you want\nsomething else to determine the color\nyou can take\nregion\nand drag it onto color and now we have\none color per region\nnow with measures again since they're\ncontinuous it's going to be more like a\nscale\nso\nif i want them to be\na different color based on sales and i\npull sales onto color it's going to be\ndarker where there's higher sales and\nlighter where there's lower sales so\nit's continuous\nfrom light to dark but for region\nit is one color per region so they're\ndistinct colors it's not continuous\ngreat um\nlet's say we want to sort this\nbiggest to smallest\nand we can look at size here so if we\nwant to adjust the size manually we can\nclick on it and drag it\nbut if we want the size to be based on\nsomething else\nyou choose a measure for the size so if\nwe want it to be\nwider\nbased on\nsales we will drag sales onto size and\nwe can see that it gets bigger with\nbigger sales we do the same thing\nand replace the sales with profit and\nnow it's bigger if there is bigger\nprofit\nand drag that back off so you can\ndetermine manually or you can do it with\nyour measures\nfor label let's say we want the sales on\nto label now we can see\nthe exact sales\nnumber\nfor each\nregion\nwhat if we wanted the name of the region\nthere as well we can drag region onto\nlabels and we can see sales for the west\nregion\nyou can adjust which one goes on top\nsee how we have two t's here those are\nboth labels\ngreat uh two tip\nwhen we click on tool tip it'll show us\nwhat's going to happen\nwhen we hover so as i hover here on east\nit says region east sales and that shows\nthe sales amount\nnow we talked about\ni'll take my labels back off wanting to\nmake this visualization not for the sum\nof sales but for the average of sales so\nwe will right click on our sum of sales\nhere in the rows hover over measure\nwhich right now is sum and change it to\naverage and we have a different\nresult here so let's sort again\nand we can see that the south\nregion actually has the highest average\nof sales which was not the case for the\nsum now let's say we want our sum i mean\nour sales to be on the label but look\nit's giving us the sum of sales label so\nwe just do the same thing\nand change it to average\nnow we can see our average on the label\nthe label has some interesting\noptions\nlike you can format this\nand we could say maybe we want it to be\nall of them to be blue\nand that happens right there\nyou can also choose to only show\nthe minimum and the maximum\nthis becomes handy on\na line chart where you don't want all\nmarks labeled because it gets very messy\nbut you want the tallest and the\nshortest part to be labeled and maybe\nyou just want the tallest so we'll click\nlabel minimum value and remove that\ncheckbox and now we just have the\ntallest value there\nand one card that we haven't used yet is\nthe filters card so\nwe could allow people\nto look at this but from only\ncertain\nregions so what we can do is we can come\nover to region and right click on it and\nclick show filter and it will add it to\nthat filters card and now we can remove\ncentral from the mix and just look at\nthose ones you see if we remove south\nthe new highest east\nnow has the label but if we put it back\nin south will have the label again if we\ndon't want to have these filters\nwe can pull it off there\nor if we wanted to filter out\nby country oh we just have united states\nso let's not filter by country um but we\ncould pull in\ncategory\nand we have these filters by category if\nwe select them all\nthey'll all be there\nand we click show filter and it will\nbring it over here and we can remove our\ntechnology and the self still has the\nhighest for the other two but if we only\ninclude technology you can see the\ndifference there\nso that's the basics of filters\none another thing that i can mention\nhere\nis that you can change the type of mark\nmanually so you saw when we pulled on\nregion and we pulled on sales it\nautomatically made us a bar chart but we\ncould change this to be a line chart and\nyou can see that the color changes\nbecause we told it too based on region\nif we pull that off\nthen it would be a line chart there\nyou can change it to be a lot of\ndifferent type of visualizations here\nso when you're not using show me to help\ndetermine your graphs you can choose it\nmanually right here\nokay\nnow let's\nlook at\nbuilding a scatter plot so scatter plot\nis when you have a bunch of shapes and\npoints on a visualization with two axes\nthat are both measures\nso if we take\nsales\nand put it on the\ny-axis and we take\ndiscount and put it on the x-axis we can\nsee\nour point that represents all of our\ndata with the sum of sales and the sum\nof discount\nand if we wanted to see this per\norder we'll take order id and put it on\nto detail now what detail does is it\ndetermines the level that we are\nbuilding our visualization at so\ngrabbing order id and putting onto\ndetail gives us all of these little\npoints so for each order what was our\nsales\nand what was our discount so we have\nout here some outliers that you can find\nvery quickly\nlet's actually do product id instead so\ni'll put it right over top of order id\nand it will replace it\nnow we see all of our products\nanything that has high sales is up here\nanything that has high discount is over\nhere you can see that it sort of has a\ntrend\nwhere\nthings with high sales do not have high\ndiscounts which makes sense if we wanted\nto\nknow what\ncategory these products i'll show up in\nwe could take category\nand put it onto shape\nand now we have three different\nshapes that tell us the categories\ntableau has a cool new highlight feature\nwhich allows you to show\njust the dimension that you want to see\nbut it leaves the other ones in place so\nfor example if we click on furniture\nfirst we have to turn on the highlight\nfeature and then click on furniture\nand now you can see all of the furniture\nitems popping up in our visualization\nand how they're kind of clustered in\nthis area and the pattern\nfor them when we click on technology we\ncan see their pattern which is a little\nbit different so we have them by shape\nwith category let's drag category onto\ncolor as well if you remember category\nwill determine the color\nand the shape at this point and so we\ncan kind of see the patterns happening\nthere\nso if we want to see our high discounted\nitems\nthey're all over here and most of the\nthings that are getting\nhigh discounts are office supplies which\nis interesting\nand then our highest sales product up\nhere\nnow we could take that product id and\nfind out what that product actually is\nout of our oh look we have product name\nlet's replace product id with product\nname and we see that that is a canon\nimage class advanced copier\nso this copier is our big sales person\nand\noffice supplies binders do not give us\nvery many sales and we're highly\ndiscounting them\nso now you know a little bit more about\nthe details card and the shapes card and\nabout using highlighting\nin tableau\nso let's say\nwe wanted to know by subcategory what\nour profit is like we could grab\nsubcategory and pull it onto columns and\nwe would say we want one column per\nsubcategory\nand then let's grab profit\nand pull it onto rows\nand you can quickly see\nwhich categories\nare profitable and which ones are not so\nwe can also take profit and put it onto\ncolor\nso that you can see that even more\nclearly\nright now it is going from orange to\nblue which is tableau's default if we\nwanted to change\nfrom what color to what color it was\ngoing we have a lot of options in here\nwhen you go to edit colors\nso maybe you wanted to go from red to\nblue\njust to emphasize that the profit that's\nnegative is bad so we can hit apply and\nnow we can see red to blue we have our\ncategories here our subcategories here\nbut let's separate it out by category so\nwhat i'm going to do i'm going to take\nsubcategory off\ni'm going to put on category and that's\nmy category and then i'm going to put\nsubcategory on after it so when we put\nit in order like this the order matters\nin tableau so first it breaks it up by\ncategory and then inside of that it\nbreaks it up by subcategory so\nfurniture's all here and then there's\nour subcategories under furniture if we\nwere to move subcategory to the front\nit really doesn't group it appropriately\nbecause first it's breaking out by\nsubcategory and then by category and\nthat's not effective we end up with\nfurniture furniture furniture furniture\nspread out across our visualization so\nagain let's put category to the front\nand now we have\nour profit by category by sub category\nand we can\nclick\nsort subcategory descending by profit\nand now what it does is within the\nhighest group within each group\nit then sorts it by profit so you can\ntell it's not going to break this group\napart to move tables to the very end\nit's going to keep tables inside of\nfurniture and then it doesn't move\nfurniture to the very end either so\nwhat we have here\nis a quick view by category by\nsubcategory how we're doing on profit we\ncan see that\ntables is our biggest drain on profit\nand so if we wanted to improve the\nprofitability of furniture\nmaybe we would\nnot sell tables anymore it's just not\nworking out for us\nanother thing about this visualization\nthat we could do to improve it\nis you can see that there's some of\nthese words are getting cut off\nso\nwe can right click on this axis and\nclick\nrotate label\nand now you can read the whole word and\nso that's helpful also up here we have\nour title which right now is the same\nname as our sheet\nso if we rename the sheet to\nprofit by\nsub category\nthen it names the title up here so this\nis making it look a little bit better\nand then here we have profit\nand it shows it but without any like\ndollar signs so let's come up here to\nprofit and click format and you can see\nthat we can format the sum of profit\nto be currency\nand\nwe can do it currency by the thousands\nand we can get rid of these decimal\nplaces\nand now you can see it's just a little\nbit nicer\na little bit more clear maybe we don't\nhave to have the label here that says\ncategory subcategory so we can hide\nfield labels for columns\nbecause it's pretty clear that these are\ncategories and these are subcategories\nso those are some formatting tips for\nyou formatting in tableau\nis one of those things where there are\njust a lot of different ways you could\nchange things\nso in more in-depth videos especially\nfrom simply learn you'll learn more and\nmore about this\nalso as we are\nbuilding these visualizations if you\nwant to\nhave access to this data set so that you\ncan build along with me just make a\ncomment in the comments below and the\nsimply learn team will send you this\ndata set now we're going to take a look\nat creating a hierarchy in tableau\nso we'll make a new tab\nand we're going to make a sheet\ncalled\nsales\nby product\nand so we will be looking at sales as a\nnumber\nand let's bring on product name\nnow there are a lot of products names so\nit's going to make sure that you really\nwant to do this i'm going to click add\nall members and now we can see all of\nour products and their sales\noverall time\nso if we sort this we can see our\nhighest sale selling item which we\ndiscovered earlier as the advanced\ncopier and we scroll down to the bottom\nour lowest selling items\nso we have our products and we can group\nthat by sub category\nand you can see i need to put it in the\nfront again\nand by category\nall right i'm going to take product name\nback off and we're going to talk about\nhierarchies so\na product rolls up into a subcategory\nwhich rolls up into a category you can\ncreate a hierarchy by\nlet's start with subcategory and\ndragging it onto category and it's going\nto create a hierarchy we'll call it our\nproduct\nhierarchy\nand now it knows that category is the\nparent to subcategory\nlet's do the same thing by grabbing\nthe product name and putting it\nunderneath subcategory so now it knows\ncategories the parent then there's\nsubcategory and then there's product\nname this allows you to instead of\npulling this off or putting it back on\nyou can bring category on and then you\ncan expand it by pressing this plus\nbutton and now we see but here's our\nsales by category by sub category\nand then here's our sales\nby category by subcategory by product\nname this is really useful when you're\ncreating a detail section for your users\nand so when somebody wants to know\nlet's say you have\nshow filter for category and a filter\nfor\nsubcategory show filter for subcategory\nand they're looking at category here and\nthey're just like i see technology has\nthe highest sales and i just want to see\ntechnology so i'm going to unclick\nfurniture and office supplies\nlet's put category on top and then so i\njust have technology will i want to see\nwhat has the highest sales inside of\ntechnology and let's sort it\nup phones phones does so i just actually\nwant to look at phones so i'm going to\nremove accessories copiers and machines\nand what has the highest sales inside of\nphones\nand sort it and now i can see quickly\nthe detailed information\nwithout having to change my\nvisualization let's give this\nvisualization a little more depth\nfirst i'll add back in all of our\ncategories and subcategories\nby\nshowing across region\nso we know technology had the highest\nbut how does it look across region now\npart of the point of tableau is to allow\nthe users to read the visualizations\nvery quickly and when you have big\nblocks of text like this it's kind of\nhard to see which one has the highest\nbecause it doesn't quite stand out very\nquickly\nso what we can do\nis take\nsales and drag it onto color let's\nchange our marks to a square and now\nit's going to color each of these it\ncolors every one of these cells based on\nits darkness for sales this is a little\nbit heavy of a color you can click color\nhere and change the opacity to give it a\nlittle bit\nof a lighter look\njust makes it a little bit see-through\ngreat so now it's a lot easier to see\nthat the west seems to have the highest\nsales\nand that technology in the east is the\nvery highest so now when we drill into\nsubcategory it keeps that coloring and\nwe can see more in depth and quicker\nthat phones has the highest across most\nof them it's not quite the highest in\nthe west because chairs is the highest\nin the west\nthere is one place in tableau where\nhierarchies are built in and that's in\ndates so dates in tableau can be very\ncomplex because they allow\nvery complex visualizations so we will\nnot go into depth about dates at this\ntime but let's take a look at how they\nwork for hierarchies so we have order\ndate that we can pull onto columns here\nand you can see that it's blue meaning\nthat it's discrete so each one of these\nis a header instead of it being an axis\nacross the top\nnow let's drag\nprofit\nonto rows\nso now we can see our profit over time\nfor each of these years\nand tableau has some hierarchies built\ninto dates already so when i click this\nplus on\ncolumns it'll split it out into quarters\nso this is a header and these are all\nsub headers underneath that header\nbecause it is distinct um and discrete\nright now instead of continuous so it's\nsplit out year year year year and\nquarters quarters quarters quarters this\nallows you to quickly compare quarter\none across all of the years and quarter\ntwo across all the years and quarter\nfour across all the years\nanother way you could add some more\ndetail to this is by taking maybe\ncategory and pulling it out to color and\nnow we have one line for each category\nand we can see that a drop in technology\nis a big part of the responsibility for\nthat drop we were seeing in quarter two\nof 2016. so let's take that back off and\nlet's take quarter back off\nand let's explore continuous dates so\nhere in dates we have our top section of\ndates and then you see it repeats and we\nhave the bottom section of dates so\nwe've got year but we also have year\nhere\nquarter and quarter now the top ones are\nall discrete and when i change it to a\nbottom one\nyear same thing same here it changes it\nto be green and now it's continuous\nso now instead of this being a header\nfor 2013 and a header for 2014 it's an\naxis so the difference here is when i\npress the plus and then changes it to\nquarter instead of adding quarter to\nyear now it's doing quarter four each\nyear and making one continuous line and\nwe can keep going\nand drill down to month\nyou can go pretty far\nnow when we add category as color\nwe get our three lines for the three\ncategories and we also have highlighting\nturned on here still so when we click on\ntechnology we can highlight technology\nwith the others in the background so we\ndon't lose the context of the other\ncategories\nlet's take that back off\nnext let us talk about calculated fields\nso we'll make a new sheet and we're\ngoing to create our first calculated\nfield we can create a calculated field\nby clicking this arrow which gives us\nsome options and clicking create\ncalculated field or we can come and\nclick in the white space below\ndimensions or below measures and we\nright click and click create calculated\nfield let's name it\nprofit ratio so this is for if we wanted\nto create a visualization that showed\nthe profit ratio but we don't have that\nmeasure readily available to us to bring\nin fields for our calculation you can do\nit in one of two ways one is to start\ntyping it\nand it will start auto prompting you for\nthe different measures or for different\ncalculations or\nvalues you can use or you can come and\ndrag it in so if we want profit and we\nwant sales if we do profit divided by\nsales that is\na profit ratio\nunaggregated\nokay and let's make a second calculated\nfield we could come here and click\nduplicate\nand that will duplicate our field but i\njust want to start over again so i'll\nclick create calculated field\nand i will call it profit\nratio\naggregated\nand in this one we're going to do sum\nclick of profit\nclick divided by\nsum of sales\nokay so now what's the difference\nbetween profit ratio\naggregated and profit ratio on\naggregated how will those behave\ndifferently in tableau let's look at\nthis by looking at a single\norder\nso first let's bring on all the orders\nand all the products\nunder that order and let's look at this\norder\nso\ni want to filter this whole dashboard to\nonly this order so i can right click on\nit and click keep only that creates a\nfilter up here\nthat only has that box checked\nand if i want to get rid of this later\ni can just pull it right off of filters\nand everything will come back but i want\nit so\nkeep only\nand now let's take a look\nat profit ratio aggregated i double\nclicked on it and i added it here and\nprofit ratio unaggregated again double\nclicking and now they're side by side\nlet's give us a little bit more room so\nwhen i dragged that out it gave us more\nroom so we could see them side by side\nand the entire titles okay so i chose to\nlook at one order and these product\nnames because the combination of order\nand product name is unique one per row\nwe know that tableau will aggregate the\ndata up to the lowest level in the\nvisualization and i brought it all the\nway down to the lowest level of the data\nsource so we have no aggregation right\nnow so when we're looking at it without\nany aggregation these two calculations\nare the same\nprofit ratio aggregated let's look at\nthat again we'll click edit and that's\nthe one where we sum profit and some\nsales before we divide\nand then we've got profit ratio\nunaggregated so let's also look at\nprofit and look at sales this is a\ntechnique that i use when i'm trying to\nunderstand how my calculated fields are\nworking try to break it down to the\nlowest level possible and see if it's\ndoing what i expect\nso we've got profit and we've got sales\nnow both of them are at\npoint five or fifty percent and that's\nbecause profit is 8 and sales 616 for\nadam's telephone messaging\nnow\nlet's take off product name when we take\noff product name we can see that they\nstart to vary we've got profit ratio\naggregated and profit ratio unaggregated\nso here we have profit and sales the\nprofit ratio should be profit divided by\nsales so let's open up a calculator\nand make it a little smaller\nso if we take profit at 219.1\nand divide it by sales at 508.6\nwe get 0.4 not 1.8 so where does this\n1.8 come from\nwell let's put product name back on here\nwhat happens is with profit ratio\naggregated it sums up the profit and\nthen divides it by the sum of sales so\nthat's what we did when we took off\nprofit ratio and aggregated we had the\nsum of profit and divided it by the sum\nof sales which is what we want profit\nratio unaggregated however\ndoes the calculation profit divided by\nsales and then\nsums it afterwards you can see it right\nhere it's the sum of profit ratio on\naggregated so it makes this calculation\nand then\nit adds up 0.5 plus 0.5 plus 0.3 plus\n0.5 and that's where we get our 1.8\nwhich is what we see\nwhen we pull off product name 1.8 so for\nmost calculations you want to do profit\nratio aggregated\nwhere you determine how it's aggregated\nbefore you do the calculation\nso let's remove profit ratio on\naggregated\nand delete it let's go to profit ratio\naggregated\nand just call it profit ratio\nperfect now we no longer need anything\nthat we have on our visualization right\nnow so let me show you a quick trick to\nclear the board tableau has this button\nup here which is called clear sheet you\ncan also do on windows alt shift\nbackspace and you just click clear sheet\nand it will start you over with that\nsheet and that really helps when you've\ndragged a bunch of things on and really\nmade a mess when you're trying things\nout okay so we're going to build a\nvisualization and we're going to look at\nregion and we're going to look at it by\nprofit ratio\nand so now we have this bar chart by\nprofit ratio let's color this by region\nwe can also pull on profit\nand sales and we can see all three of\nthem side by side split out by region\nnow let's say we also wanted to see\neach region\nby sales per customer so let's create\nsome calculated fields that will help us\ndo that let's create our first\ncalculated field\nthat's going to get us a count of\ncustomers\nlet's call it total\nnumber of customers\nand so we have customer name and\ncustomer id let's do\ncount distinct\nof customer id and that gives us the\ntotal number of customers\napply so right now we could take total\nnumber of customers and see which\ncategories have the highest number of\ncustomers perfect but that's just one\npart of our calculation we want to see\ntotal sales divided by total number of\ncustomers so let's make our second\ncalculated field and we're going to call\nit\nsales per\ncustomer\nwe're going to do our sum\nof sales\nwhich we can drag in\nand divide that by\ntotal number of customers now you see\nthat calculated field we just made pops\nup inside of our calculation\ndialog box and we hit apply\nand it shows up so we hit ok and let's\nreplace\ntotal number of customers\nwith\nsales per customer and now we can see\nour sales per customer ratio and which\nones have the highest or for this next\npart i'm going to make a couple of\nvisualizations in a row that all applied\nto the same information using a couple\nof different tactics so first let's use\nshow me so i want to look at\nregion\nand sales for this visualization so i'm\ngoing to control click\nregion after i clicked sales so one more\ntime i'm going to\nclick on sales and i'm going to control\nclick region\nand i'm going to click show me and it's\ngoing to give me all of the different\nvisualizations i could make with region\nand sales let's pick\ntree map\ngreat so now we have a tree map that\nshows us our sales\nby region\nand we have the size and the color of\nthe box is both sales so let's say we\nwanted the size to be sales but the\ncolor to be profit so let's grab profit\nand drag that on to sales so now we can\nsee our most profitable to our least\nprofitable\nlet's edit our colors and we're going to\nchange it from red to blue diverging red\nto blue but let's go to advanced and\nmake the center number\nzero\nthis means that it will never be red\nunless it's less than zero so let's hit\napply so it's all blue and if anything\never goes negative then it will be red\nokay let's call this sheet\nsales\nprofit by region\nperfect\nnow we're going to start using our\ngeographical\nfields so we have state city country and\npostal code let's double click on state\nand see what happens\nawesome so it is\ngenerated these two fields tableau has\ngenerated longitude and latitude for us\nand it's been able to recognize the\nstates in the united states and where\nthey're located and given it a longitude\nand latitude\nso next we will\nlook at sales\nby state by double clicking on sales and\nwhat it's done was change the size of\nthe dot based on sales now i think i'm\ngoing to move sales from size to color\nand it has automatically changed it to a\nfilled map instead of dots on a map\nperfect so now we can see the states\nwith the biggest amount of sales\nlet's put it back onto size and we have\nour circles again\nlet's put sales on the size not stay\ndown to size and we have our circles\nagain but let's make them a little bit\nbigger\nthese two marks on the tableau size line\nare to give you an idea of how big and\nhow small you should go before it gets\ntoo difficult to see so when we go\nbigger than the bigger line it detects\nthat you're getting close to having\noverlap\nbut it's up to you as the builder okay\nso we have size for\nsales again and for profit onto color\nagain so you can see\nanything that is more profitable is\ndarker and anything that is less\nprofitable\nor less than zero in this case is orange\nlet's do what we did with color before\nchange it to\nred blue diverging and\nset our center point to zero okay so now\nwe know that if anything is red it was\nnegative in profit perfect let's name\nthis sheet\nsales\nprofit by state\ngreat now let's look at sales and profit\nby category so we have category and\nwe've made columns so\nthis is when we drag something to the\ncolumns shelf just remember we want one\ncolumn per category\nand let's double click on sales and it's\ngoing to put it into text and that's not\nwhat i want so let's take sales and drag\nit onto rows and it automatically makes\na bar chart so now we have one bar with\nthe axis of sales for furniture office\nsupplies and technology\nnow let's\ntake profit and also put it on\nrows so now we have two bar charts one\nfor sales and one for profit we can\nchange which one is a bar and which one\nis maybe a bubble chart by clicking on\nits appropriate marks card so if we want\nto change them both we can click on all\nand change them both to maybe circles\nand you can see how they go up and down\nbut if we want to just change\none of them let's put those back to\nautomatic we'll go to profit and change\nthat one to\nthe circles so now we can see\nthose profit numbers and if we want them\nto be overlaid on the same area\nwe would right click on profit the\nsecond measure on the rows and click\ndual axis so now let's put them onto the\nsame axis you can see that their axes\nare not lined up let's go to sales and\nchange it back to\na bar\nso now we have two charts occupying the\nsame space\none of them is a bar chart and one of\nthem is a bubble chart and we can see\nour sales versus our profit at least\nthey're not the same amount of dollars\nobviously but we can see a higher\nsales and a higher profit we also have\nmedium sales and a medium profit we have\na medium sales but a really low profit\nand it's interesting to see that\ncontrast so let's rename this sheet\nas\nsales profit\nby category\nand\nfinally we're going to make our details\nsheet so we're going to go down to\nsubcategory level and bring it onto rows\nand remember subcategory can expand out\nto the actual products let's bring that\nback in and we're going to bring sales\nonto columns which makes us a sales bar\nchart and profit onto columns which\nmakes us a profit bar chart now let's\ncolor them by their appropriate\nindividual color so we'll go to the\nsales marks card and drag sales onto\ncolor now sales is colored by sales\nwe'll do the same thing here we did\nbefore we'll go red blue diverging\n[Music]\nand make the center\nzero we actually don't have to do that\nfor sales because sales will never be\nnegative but it's pretty important for\nprofit so we'll go to the profit marks\ncard and take profit onto color\nand do the same thing there\nwe have red blue diverging\nadvanced center is zero great so now if\nit's negative it will be there so let's\nsort this\nby profit and so both of them have\nsorted with profit in mind and we can\neasily see our subcategories that have a\nnegative profit\nrename this\nand we'll call it our details sheet\nso now we have these four visualizations\nthat all have to do with similar\ninformation\ni think i want these bigger on the\nstates so we'll just keep making that\nbigger perfect now we're going to make\nour first dashboard so for our dashboard\nwe have\ninformation over here that shows you\nwhat sheets you can bring on these get a\nlittle bit more complex so they'll be\ncovered in more in-depth type of videos\nand then we have our size so\nwe could make a range of sizes based on\num maybe what you're viewing this on but\nwe're just going to change it to a fixed\nsize\nand we're going to make it\n1400 by\na thousand and this is our\ndashboard size so let's bring on\nsales profit by region sales and profit\nby state now a map needs a little bit\nmore horizontal space than region does\nlet's bring sales and profit by category\nunderneath the region\nand the detail underneath the state give\nour map more space again\nperfect\nnow tableau has this neat feature called\nuses filter so you can click use this\nfilter here and now if i click on any of\nthese it will filter the other\ndashboards based on these features so if\ni just want to look at the south and i\nclick on south it zooms into all my\nsouth states now my categories have\nupdated to be just the south ones and my\ndetails have updated as well so we could\nsee that central\nhas pretty big sales you know bigger\nthan the south but the profit is lower\nthan the south so we can click on\ncentral and focus on central let's use\nthat uses filter\non all three of these\ndashboards that lead us up to the detail\nso building a quick dashboard like this\nlet's make this taller would allow you\nto do some sort of analysis such as\nlet's take a look at central because\nthey have relatively high profits but\nlow sales so we click on central and\nthen we see oh man texas is having a\nreally hard time so let's click on texas\nand now we're seeing in texas that we\nhave\nnegative profit in these categories so\nwe can control click on furniture and\noffice supplies and we can see all of\nour products that are really just\nkilling us in texas all of our\nsubcategories and if we want to go\ndeeper into products we'll just click\nthat plus sign and now we see all the\nproducts and we'll sort again\nand we can see all the products by\nsubcategory that are really just killing\nus\nand are maybe not worthwhile to make\nanymore so we're gonna have to\nreconsider making the 3.6 cubic foot\ncounter height office refrigerator at\nleast for texas it's not very helpful\nthere and then when you\nback out of that subcategory section you\ncan also click\nsomewhere neutral in the dashboard or\nclick on each thing that you had\nselected to unselect it and go back to\nthe main part of your visualization and\nstart it all over again now let's move\non and take a look on how to create\nparameters and sets so new sheet\nand let's make a quick visualization\nthat will apply our parameters and our\nsets too\nso let's take a look at all of our\ncustomers\nby their sales and let's sort customer\nname descending by sales great so now\nwe're going to make a parameter that\nwill allow the user of the dashboard to\nchoose how many customers they want to\nsee how many of our top customers that\nthey want to see\nso let's click this down arrow and click\ncreate parameter\nand we will name it\ntop and customers\ngreat we're going to make it an integer\nand we're going to give them the option\nto choose the number of customers within\na range our low is going to be five so\nwe'll let them see five\nor\nup to 20\nand we're going to let them skip with\nstep size of 5. let's start their\ncurrent value right in the middle with\n10.\nokay so now if you want to see how this\nparameter looks you can come down to\nparameters before we only had dimensions\nand measures on the left side of our\ntableau workspace but now we have\nparameters that has appeared once we\ncreate a parameter we can right click on\nthe parameter and click show parameter\ncontrol and we can see our top end\ncustomers right now our parameter\ncontrol isn't built into any of our\nvisualizations but you can see how it\nworks we allow them to go down to five\nand up to 20 with steps of five\ngreat now we're going to create a set a\nset is a custom field that defines a\nsubset of data based on some conditions\nso the set we're going to build is going\nto be based on customer name so when you\nright click on customer name you can\ncome down and click create hover on\ncreate and create a set with so far when\nwe created a parameter and a calculated\nfield you clicked here\nwith this down arrow and you saw create\ncalculated field and create parameter\nbut it's not there a set has to be based\non an existing field so you come and you\nclick on the field you want it to be\nbased on and then hover on create and\nyou see set\nso here's how we can create a set let's\nname it\ntop and\ncustomers\nby sales so we're going to allow them to\nselect the top end customers and have\nthat select our top customers by sales\nso we want this set to include anything\nthat is in the top however many they\ndefined by the parameter\nby sales so you can come over here to\ntop\nand change it to by field we want it to\nbe top but not just top static 10 we're\ngoing to click here and our parameter\nshows up so it's going to be top top end\ncustomers\nand then you can choose\nanother field here\nfor it to be defined by and it's sales\nand we want it to be by sum of sales if\nwe wanted it to be by\nthe average profit we can come here and\nclick profit and change this to average\nand now we would see our top end\ncustomers by average profit\nbut we want sales and some\nokay so we've created our set and we can\ndrag it on to rows to see how it works\nand we can see these are our top 10\ncustomers by their sales and we have\nthis in slash out\nthat's generated by our set so if we\ntake our set\nfirst let's see how this line moves when\nwe change our number here so right now\nit's 10 when we move it up we see our\nline moves down to include the top 15\nand now we can quickly see our top 20.\nwe'll go back to 10\nand let's grab the set and drag it onto\nour filters so now we have filtered the\ndata down to our top 10. if this were\napplied to a dashboard this would allow\nthe end user to see the top 10 quickly\nand then maybe expand it out to the top\n20 if they're interested in that\ninformation now let's move on to\ncreating a donut chart so a donut chart\nis basically a pie chart with a white\ncenter so let's start by building a pie\nchart which in tableau is pretty easy\nespecially if you use show me so let's\ncreate a pie chart for each category\nby sales so we're going to click\ncategory and then we're going to control\nclick sales so we have them both\nselected we'll come over to show me and\nclick pie and there we have our pie\nchart we'll close show me let's come up\nhere\nand click entire view so we see our pie\nvery clearly here if we wanted to have\none pie for each\nregion we can take region\nand drag that onto columns\nso we have one column for each region\nand then one pie for each of them you\ncan see that the pie varies in size\nbased on sales as well as the angle is\nfor sales so east has more sales in\ngeneral than south\nand this helps you to see that\ntechnology\nhas smaller sales in the south than it\ndoes in the east so i recommend keeping\nif you're going to make pie charts\nallowing the size of the pie chart to be\naffected as well as the angle by\nwhatever measure you're using but for\nour purposes for donut charts we're\ngoing to want them to all be the same\nsize so we took sales off of size and\nnow we have all of our pie charts the\nsame size now we're going to make what's\ncalled a dual axis chart and to make a\ndual axis chart we have to have two axes\nso let's grab\nnumber of records and we'll grab it and\ndrag it to rows and we will change it\nfrom sum to minimum and that's because\nevery record will have a minimum number\nof rows of one and then they all end up\non the same axis great and now we're\ngoing to make a second number of records\nby minimum and we can do that by doing\nthose steps again by dragging number of\nrecords up here and changing it to\nminimum again or a quick trick that i\ncan show you is if you want to\nduplicate anything you have on the chart\nhere you can just hit control and then\nclick and drag it and it will duplicate\nit so if you wanted your number of\nrecords to also be down here onto your\ndetails or on your labels you can\ncontrol click it and then leave it there\ngreat so now we have our two axes and we\nhave our two marks cards that each\naffect their own\nset of visualizations so let's go to\nthis top one affects these so let's show\nthat by changing the size\nand it's made these bigger and this\nbottom one affects these and we'll do\nthat by changing it to\ncircle so now each of these are a circle\nlet's take category off of color and we\ncan take some of sales off of detail and\nlet's change the color to white\nand now we're going to put this white\ncircle on top of our pie chart by\nclicking here on our second measure\nand clicking dual axis and now it's got\nthem lined up one on top of the other\nand we have our donut chart so if we\nwant our donut\nslices to be a little thinner we can\nchange the size of our inner circle and\nmake it bigger\nperfect and so now we have one pie chart\nfor each region one doughnut chart for\neach region and if we wanted to take\nthis header and put it inside of our pie\nchart what we can do is take region and\nput it on the label for the circle and\nit's putting it down here you can come\nand edit that by clicking on label and\nchanging its alignment so let's put it\nin the middle\nperfect so now we can see\nour header here so we don't need it down\nhere anymore you can right click and\nclick\nshow header and it hides that header we\nalso don't want to see our labels for\nour axes so we right click and click\nshow header there and now we just see\nour pies\nso to get how the number of sales here\nfor each of them let's go to\nremember our pie marks card and let's\ntake\nour sales and add it to label so now\neach of our slices of pie can tell you\nhow much sales they have if you take the\nsales here that's on label right click\nand click format we can change that to\ncurrency\nand let's get rid of our decimal places\nperfect now close formatting and let's\nsay we want the total amount of sales to\nbe in the middle here with central so we\ngo back to affecting our circle grab\nsales drag it to label\nso now we have four doughnut charts\nformatted to allow us to quickly see the\nsales numbers for each segment and also\nfor the donut as a whole you can also\nchange the colors that tableau selects\nfor each slice by coming to the marks\ncard that has color for the pie so\ncategory color and clicking edit colors\nand you could change it to\nany of these automatic ones\nwhere if you double click on one it\ngives you all of the options for colors\nthat you could possibly want there's\nalso several different palettes you\ncould choose from so let's say we like\nthis one and you can just click assign\npalette and it will grab those off of\nthere those look very similar to what we\nhave already so i'm going to pick a\ndifferent one\nand click assign palette click apply\nand this allows you to make some color\nchanges and you fit your business a\nlittle bit more\nspecifically\nperfect let's say\nwe make our\npies bigger\nincrease that size\nand we'll also increase the center size\noh not that much perfect\nnow we'll use a similar technique to\ncreate the two-dimensional pie chart\na two-dimensional pie chart can be used\nso that you can show\ntwo pie charts at the same time um or a\npie chart that's kind of split up by\ndifferent categories this has been\navailable in some other tools and\ntableau can do it too so let's just\ndemonstrate that we're going to start\nagain by creating our\ngeneric category by sales so with ctrl\nclick sales we come over to show me and\nclick pie and it makes our pie for us it\nremembers the colors that you have\ndetermined in other pages so that's a\nnice feature again let's make it entire\nview so we can see our pie nice and big\nand now we're going to\ncreate our dual axis again so we grab\nnumber of records put it on rows and see\nhow it adds an axis but each one of\nthese categories has a different value\nfor the number of records however they\nhave the same minimum\nvalue for number of records and it puts\nthem all back onto the same spot great\nand then we will control click and drag\nto make our two axes and let's come to\nour top one\nand make it bigger that affected both of\nthem because we still have sales on size\nfor both of them\nso sales is affecting the size of the\npie chart as well as the size of the\nangles so let's take sales off of size\nfor both of them\nand make the second pie chart a little\nsmaller perfect now let's also affect\nour second pie chart by having the color\ndefined by region instead of defined by\nsales let's talk about how i'm replacing\nit with region so you could change the\ncolor by dragging region onto color and\nthat replaces it or let's go back and we\ncan drag region right on top of the\nthing we're trying to replace and it\nwill replace it there\ngreat so now we have the smaller circle\nthat's going to go on top split up by\nregion with the angle defined by sales\nand the category is on the top one with\nthe angle defined by sales let's pick\nsome nicer colors\nmaybe we'll use the same palette we used\nfor\ncategory\nthis one this one seems right but we'll\npick different ones than those three so\nwe click on the one we want to change\nand click on the color we want to change\nit to i'm just going to keep following\nthis right down click apply great and\nthen we\nput it on top of the other one by\nclicking dual axes now sometimes it's\neasier to see these when they have a\nborder so we can come to color we click\nborder and add maybe some black lines\nallow you to see the inner pie\nseparate from the outer pie maybe\nour border could have white lines how\ndoes that look\nand we can make them both bigger\nlike we did before\nwell not that big\nand you can also add labels like we did\nbefore\nwe'll take sales onto our labels here\nand you can see that hovering allows you\nto see all the information you need now\none more thing so while we like to hide\nthis axis\nwe'd also like to maybe hide this grid\nline that's occurring so you can click\nright click and format and let's go to\nour lines\nthat change that zero line to none\nperfect get rid of some of the clutter\non this visualization i still feel like\nthis outer pie should be a little bigger\nand we want to clean up our tool tip so\nit doesn't have min number of records in\nit this piece should be 100 behind the\nscenes so we can come to tool tip right\nas you click on it it'll pop up with\neverything that's in your tool tip and\nwe're just going to erase\nmid number of records i raced too much\nyou need to leave your angle brackets\nokay and now this piece of\nthe pie no longer has that the inner one\nlet's do that there too\nmin number of records remove that right\nout and there you have it a\ntwo-dimensional pie chart and here are\nour donut charts this demonstration goes\nto show you that even when tableau\ndoesn't have visualization you're\nlooking for in their basic show me\noptions you can still get to it so donut\ncharts aren't included up here and\nneither is a two-dimensional pie chart\nbut without too much extra work we can\nmake it happen\nthese visualizations are a little bit\nmore complex than your everyday\nvisualizations and so i recommend going\nthrough this tutorial with the data set\nand following along if you want access\nto the data set just comment below and\nthe simply learned team will get back to\nyou also comment below with any\nquestions you have at this point in the\npresentation we're going to put together\nsome dashboards so first let's build our\nworksheets for this dashboard we're\ngoing to build a worksheet\ncalled\nsales by\nyear which adds the name up here and\nwe're going to\ntake our order date and drag it onto\ncolumns and now we want this to be a\ncontinuous axis so we're going to change\nit to our continuous year and now we\nhave an axis and we're going to look at\nsales\nso now we have our sales by year if we\nwant labels on each of these dots we can\ndrag sales onto\nlabels and if we want to have different\ncolor lines for each region for example\nwe can drag region onto color\nand that splits our lines up\ninto the different regions and gives us\na legend over here perfect now we're\ngoing to duplicate this sheet by right\nclicking down here and clicking\nduplicate now we have sales by year two\nlet's rename it to\nprofit\nby year\nand then let's drag profit\nright over top of sum of sales\nso that it replaces it with profit now\nit's been replaced with profit and all\nthese different data points are here\nhowever it's still showing the title of\nsum of sales and that could be very\nconfusing so always make sure that your\nlabels are consistent with your data so\nlet's take profit and drag it over top\nof the type labels as well that's more\nconsistent with our axis\nso now we have sales by year and we have\nprofit by year let's do a couple of\nthings to clean these up\nlike\nright click here\ngo\nformat and we'll change our numbers to\ncurrency\ncustom\nand now it's marked as dollars\none thing you can do in tableau is\nlet's undo that\nsince\nsales is going to be dollars pretty much\neverywhere we use it we can define our\ndefault property for these numbers so\nwhen we right click on the measure here\nyou can go to default properties and you\nhave the options to change the defaults\nfor any of these things and we're going\nto change our number format\nchange it to\ncurrency custom\nno decimal places hit okay and that also\nhas updated this sheet now that only\nworks on places where you haven't\nspecifically defined it to be formatted\ndifferently so we could still define it\nto be different here on this sheet than\nit is on any other sheet\nlet's do the same thing for profit\nchange our default properties\nto\nthe same thing great now let's build our\ndashboard\nwe're going to call this\nour\noverall dashboard\nchange our\nsize\nthis size is a personal preference of\nmine i think it fits nicely on the\nlaptops that i use and that is used by\nmost of our customers now let's drag\nsales by year now watch what happens\nwhen i drag it on here it brings sales\nby year but it also brings the legend\nfor the region that was created the same\nthing should happen with profit by year\nit's detected that the same legend is\nbeing used so it didn't bring over a\nsecond legend and we have highlighting\nturned on let's see if this works for\nboth charts we click on central and you\nsee it highlights central in both charts\nthat's great so now we have a dashboard\nshowing us profit by year and sales by\nyear but let's say we want to be able to\nfilter this dashboard to just maybe one\ncategory so let's go back to our sales\nby year sheet\nand let's drag category\nonto filters\nand now it's going to let us select\nwe're going to select all\nand hit ok and then right click on\ncategory and click show filter so now it\nis over here\nand we're going to do\na similar thing on profit by year but\nwe'll do the shortcut where you come\nover here to category you right click on\nit and you just click show filter and it\nputs it here and it puts it here so now\nwe have\na filter here for category\nand a filter here for category\nand so when we go to overall\nwe can come to our\ndrop down here more options\nhover over filters\nand you can see category now here's an\ninteresting thing that we'll see\neven though we have a category filter on\nboth charts when i take furniture out\nyou can see only sales by year changed\nand profit by year stayed the same now\nwhy would that be\nthat's because we have two different\nfilters for category one on the sales\nworksheet and one on the profit by year\nworksheet i'll show that\nby clicking here\ngoing to filters\nand grab category now we have category\nthat will affect\nprofit by year and not sales by year\nthat's not what we want we want one\nfilter to affect them both so\nlet's back it up a bit\ntake these back off let's go to profit\nby year now we're going to take off\ncategory\nlet's go to sales by year and we're\ngoing to say we want this same filter to\naffect both worksheets so we're going to\nright click here hover over apply to\nworksheets and click selected worksheets\nnow we select sales by year is selected\nand we select profit by year okay so\nwhen we go to\nthe profit by year\nsheet\nyou can see that it now has category on\nthere let's go to overall let's come\nhere\nfilters category and now we have a\nfilter\nthat affects both worksheets\nthere we go let's format this filter a\nlittle bit we'll come to more options\nand we're going to select we want them\nto be able to select multiple values\nstill but let's do it in a drop down\nso now\nyou still have those options\nbut it is a little bit more compact\nlet's do\na couple more filters so we can do by\ncategory\nlet them filter out regions\nlet's do it the the shorter way right\nclick show filter there it is\napply to worksheets selected worksheets\nboth of these\nokay\ndashboard\nfilters and by region\nmultiple values drop down\nand let's let them\nchange their\ntime selection so this one's a little\nbit different since we've already\ndetermined that we wanted year and we\nwanted it to be continuous filters for\ncontinuous fields are a little bit\ndifferent than filters for\nthese discrete fields\nand that's because continuous fields are\na range instead of just a list so we\ndon't list out a continuous field we\nmake a range for it so we've already\ndefined that we want it to be continuous\nyear and if i come over here\nand click on right click order date and\nclick show filter it's doing discrete\nyear by default\nso\nremove filter if you drag order date\nonto filters\nit lets you pick\nwhat you want it to look at\nlet's come up here to year that's\nalready marked as continuous and click\nshow filter and now it is year but it's\nbased on a range and we have this slider\nand you can see how that slider affects\nour visualization\nlet me show you a trick to make this\napply to both not a trick but just if\nyou have not applied it to both\nworksheets but you already added it to\nthe visualization see it's here but it's\nonly affecting one worksheet you can\nchange the worksheets\nsettings right on the filter instead of\nhaving to go to\nthe worksheet where the filter exists\nand it will only give you the options of\nthe worksheets that are on the dashboard\nso there we have it\nnow it affects both and now we have our\noverall dashboard\nnow let's say you want to be able to see\nthe total sales on this chart as well as\nthe sales split up by\neach of the regions we can do that as\nwell so let's go back to our sales sheet\nas a quick tip you can go to the sheet\nby clicking this go to sheet button here\nor here\nin the event that you want to go to a\nsheet but you don't want to scroll back\nand forth to find where it is so go to\nsheet now we're going to do a dual\naccess chart again like we showed\nearlier and i'm going to control\nclick and drag\nso now we have sum of sales twice\nthis marks card affects the top one so\nwe can see that by\nif i change the opacity\nhow it changes the color right here this\nis the top one\nand this marks card is the bottom one\nand we're going to remove region\noff of color and that makes our combined\none line again perfect now if we want\nthis to be on the same space as this we\nright click here the second measure in\nthe rows section and click dual axis so\nlet's put it right on top i can see\nthis versus this now if we wanted to on\nhover show that this is overall sales we\ncan click on tool tip region is missing\nbecause we don't have it with the color\nby region anymore so we'll erase that\nand put\noh we don't want it to be orange let's\nmake it black\noverall sales okay so when you hover\nhere it says overall sales so we can see\nthe difference easily let's make it um a\nlittle bit more of a color that'll stand\nout just a little darker than the others\nperhaps\nso when we go back to our work all right\ndashboard we can see sales and we can\nsee our overall sales let's do the same\nthing for profit by year\ngo to sheet and\ncontrol\ndrag\nrelease\nwe'll go to our marks card for this\nsecond sheet and pull off region\nmake it darker\nchange our tool tip\nnot\norange overall\nprofit\nokay\nand right click\ndual access\nthere we go now i forgot to do one thing\non the last dashboard when you make a\ndual access dashboard it doesn't\nnecessarily\nsync up these axes and so this axis over\nhere is for the overall line and this\naxis over here is for the region line\nso if we want it to stay that way we\nshould\nedit our axes\nand instead of calling it just profit\nover here\nwe will change it to overall profit\nand over here\nprofit by region\njust so that it's clear which axis goes\nto the which one\nor\nyou can come here and click synchronize\naxes so it's very clear that this is\nmuch bigger than these\nand if you synchronize the axes\nlet's go back before we named him\nokay synchronize the axis then we don't\nneed both of these headers so we can\ncome here and click show header and we\njust have the one let's do the same\nthing on sales by year\nsynchronize\nalways good to make sure that your axes\nare either synchronized or well labeled\nand let's hide it let's see what it\nlooks like now\ngreat\nokay one thing to keep in mind\nwhen we do\nfilter\nto just one\n[Music]\nregion\nthe lines are going to end up at the\nsame spot\nif we filter to 2\nthen it's only the sum of those two\nso\nperhaps the header overall sales and\noverall profit isn't quite accurate\nbecause it isn't overall necessarily\nwhen we have it filtered um why does\nthis happen\nwhy doesn't this line always show the\ntotal no matter what you select here\nwell that's because this filter applies\nto the whole dashboard so it filters\nthis line to those regions just as much\nas it filters these\nlines so i'm going to remove out that\ntooltip line because it could be a\nlittle misleading\nlet's continue on and make a dashboard\nthat digs a little bit more into sales\nspecifically great so we'll make our\nfirst sheet we'll call it\nsales by region\nand we're gonna make another pie chart\nso\nlet's do it using show me we'll click on\nregion\nand then we will control click on sales\nopen up show me click pie let's close it\nagain great so now we have the sales by\nregion pi we'll make it the entire view\nand when you hover you can see that it's\nshowing us sales in dollar amounts now\nit would be\nmore\nlike a pie for it to be percentages so a\nlot of pies each of these slices is\nshown as a percentage of the whole\nat one hundred percent so let's come\nhere to our slice size we'll right click\non it and we're going to use what's\ncalled a quick table calculation\nand change it to percent of total so now\nwhen you hover you can see that the west\nis 31\nof the pie\ngreat\nlet's also label each of these slices so\ni'm going to control click and drag\nregion onto label\nand add region to the labels i'm going\nto undo that and show you what would\nhappen if i just dragged region onto\nlabels without copying it without\nholding ctrl it will move it and get rid\nof our colors and we don't want that so\nwe're going to control and drag another\nway to do this let's go back is by\ntaking region and dragging it onto label\njust straight from over here but in this\ncase for the sum of sales where we've\napplied the quick table calculation we\nwant that quick table calculation to\nalso show up in our label so i'm going\nto control and drag and it brings that\nquick table calculation along with it if\ni were to\nundo just drag\nsales\non it's going to go back to that dollar\namount and i'm going to have to add\nanother quick table calculation so\ninstead ctrl and drag\nthat's probably one of my very favorite\ntableau tricks great now let's add a\nfilter for region so i'm going to right\nclick here and click show filter and we\nwill make sure that this gets added to\nall of our sheets once we've made them\nall\nokay next sheet we're going to call this\nsheet sales by state\nlet's do a map great so one way to get\nyour map started is to double click on\nany of these dimensions that have a\nglobe next to them so since we want to\ngo with state we can double click on\nstate and it starts mapping out state so\nwhat it does is it adds latitude and\nlongitude to our rows and columns that\nare generated here and another way to\nget going so let's go back is to click\non the geographic part you want and then\ncontrol click on sales like we did for\nmap sorry for our pie chart come over to\nshow me and choose one of our maps we\ncould do it with the circles but we're\nto do a field map\nclick on that so now we have our field\nmap based on state\nwe can choose one of these different\npalettes if we'd like let's try this one\nor blue teal\nor we could do green so that darker\ngreen means more money\ngreat so now we have all of our states\ncolored by sales let's also control and\ndrag sales onto label\nand you can see we have the dollar sign\nand the money formatting that we made\nearlier and let's control and drag state\nonto label\nnow maybe we want the state to be on top\nso we can click on label\nand it pops up with all these different\noptions and if we want to edit the text\nyou can click here\non the ellipses\nand edit it there so let's cut state\nand paste it\nat the top there i think i lost my\ncenter alignment so we'll do that again\nhit apply see what we think\ngreat okay so now you can see that it\nputs the state on top you can also see\nin some of these places where they're\nsuper close together that you can't see\nall of the state's labels and that's\nbecause\nthis option here in labels is unchecked\nallow labels to overlap other marks so\ntableau senses when the marks are too\nclose together and it's going to become\ntoo hard to read and we'll hide anything\nthat overlaps with each other if we\nclick this option now you see everything\nbut it gets a little crowded over here\nso let's unselect that and you'll be\nable to see what the sales are upon\nhover\ngreat now we have our sales by state\nfor filters for this one let's no let's\nright click on sales here and click show\nfilter so basically wherever you're\nusing your metrics your dimensions or\nyour measures you can right click on\nthem\nand create your filters\nso now we could\nthe lowest amount for a state is 920\nfor sales for this time period and we\ncould filter out ones that have sales\nlower than that but\ni think this isn't what i want let's\nremove that filter let's do it for the\nstate show filter great so now we could\nfilter out\na state we could just show\narizona\nor show them all\nexcellent let's move on to our next\nvisualization new sheet\nrename it to be called\nsales by\nsub category\ngreat so we're going to drag on category\nonto columns and subcategory we could\neither drag on subcategory here or\nbecause of our hierarchy press plus now\nwe have subcategory and category and\nlet's bring on sales it's defaulting to\nthis bar chart which is perfect that's\nwhat i want and now we could color it by\nsubcategory and this is a discrete\ncoloring we could also color it by\nsales\nand this is a continuous coloring so the\ndarkest corresponds with the height now\nwe don't need to do this there is\nalready an indicator of who has the most\nsales and that's based on the bar height\nso if we wanted to color it by\nsubcategory then each one of them gets\ntheir own color we could color it by\ncategory to add to\nthe distinction between the different\ncategories so that's very clear\nwhere they start and stop let's do\nby sub category excellent so now we have\nthree different dashboards oh let's add\nsome filters for subcategory so let's\nbring on\ncategory as our filter so we'll right\nclick here click show filter there's\ncategory and let's do a filter for\nour date so we're going to come here to\norder date let's drag it onto filters\nand let's click years\nnow these are all the years options\nwe'll click all\nand hit ok\nright click here and click show filter\nso now instead of doing a range where we\ncould drag that line now we have\ndiscrete filter and so we can\ncheck and uncheck boxes to choose what\nyears we want to see\nawesome let's start with our dashboard\nlet's call this dashboard\nour sales dashboard and\nchange our size\nif you have any questions about\ndifferent sizes what's available here be\nsure to ask that in the comments below\nand\nlet's start with pulling on our sales by\nregion so last time we pulled on a chart\nwe saw that it added the legend for us\nbut this time you can see it added both\nthe legends\nand the filter so last time we created\nthe filters after we built the dashboard\nbut this time you can see that the\nfilter um gets brought in when we\nbrought in the dashboard let's do our\nsales by state side by side here and\nlet's do sales by subcategory underneath\nso i dragged it you can see how i pull\nit towards the bottom of the dashboard\nand it kind of fills in the space where\nit's going to be\nand then brings it in so now it's\nbrought in all our filters and all of\nour legends it defaults to putting the\nfilters and legends over here we're\ngoing to click select layout layout\ncontainer it's going to select what's\nwhat they're all inside of and we're\ngoing to make it take up this whole side\nbut it doesn't need that much space\nso you can see in tableau there's a lot\nof dragging there's a lot of dropping\nand\na lot of resizing to get things the way\nyou want them to be give our map more\nroom\nand we have a mixture over here of\nlegends and\nfilters let's move our legends out of\nthere so we can grab this legend and\ncome and put it on this side\nand this legend come put it over here\nso that we're getting a little bit more\nnear the visualizations they belong to\nthis legend goes up here with this one\ni'm going to actually click here and\nchange it from\na tiled so right here it says tiled\nobject to a floating object that lets it\nsit on top of a visualization i'm going\nto put it on top of this visualization\nright up here\nexcellent and then we have this one\nthat's showing us the size of sales\nthat's because on this dashboard it says\nthat size is determined by sales but\nsince it's just one\ncircle there's no size comparison so\nit's not like we have several circles\nand we have to look and see which one's\nthe biggest so that we can tell that the\namount of sales so we don't need this\nlegend and we can just remove it from\nthe dashboard let's clean up some of\nthese we have several different versions\nof what your filters could look like so\nmy personal favorite is multiple values\ndrop down it gives you some of the most\nflexibility but if you wanted them to\nonly be able to select a single value\nyou could turn it into a radio button\nlist so that it's a selected all or it's\none at a time\nyou could also do a drop down or a\nslider and make that happen\na slider is a little bit different from\na range on the range you can see that we\ncould edit either side and it's picking\neverything in between but with discrete\nvalues if you say everything in between\nit doesn't make a lot of sense because\nwhat's everything between furniture and\ntechnology we don't know that office\nsupplies goes between those there's no\norder so\nlet's do\nmultiple value drop downs\nfor big ones like state there is the\noption\nof searching so i know i want utah and i\nsearch and there's utah\ninstead of having to scroll through the\nlist this could be really helpful for if\nyou had a filter for by products and\nthat would allow somebody to look at\njust one product at a time if they know\ntheir name of the product but also not\nhave to just open up the product list\nand scroll and scroll and scroll since\nthere are very a lot of products so we\ncan filter by region\nby doing this oh this is a great\nreminder you saw that this did not\nchange all the visualizations we have\nyet to apply these filters to all the\nworksheets so let's do that right now\napply to worksheets selected worksheets\nand we will click all on dashboard\nhit okay\nwe'll do this again\n[Music]\nuntil we have selected them all\ngreat so it's really nice you get to\nchoose what worksheets you wanted to\napply to because in the event that you\nhad maybe um\na total number up here at the top that\nyou just wanted to stay the same all the\ntime no matter what they selected you\ncould make that happen by not selecting\nthat worksheet to be changed by these\nfilters okay great so we can change what\nregion we're looking at by selecting\ncentral here and then we're just looking\nat central throughout all the\nvisualizations i love looking at it on a\nmap and seeing just one at a time it\njust really makes the region name just\nstand out to you but if we wanted to use\nthis as our filter to filter the rest of\nthe dashboards we can click this uses\nfilter button and now when we click on\ncentral here it stays in context here\nbut the other two dashboards change\none thing you may notice is that texas\nis not the darkest on this chart because\nof the scale the scale goes up to half a\nmillion there but then when we click on\ncentral the scale updates just for\nwhat's selected so everything else is\nfiltered out and now the darkest of the\ndark is only 170 000\nand texas becomes the darkest on the\nvisualization there are some ways you\ncan change that but if you're wondering\nwhy do my colors look a little\ndifferently when i filter that's why\ngreat we could also click use this\nfilter here so if we just wanted to look\nat texas\nwe click this this updates to just\ncentral this updates to just texas down\nhere and unselect\nby\nclicking on maybe another state or when\nyou click on the state again it should\nunselect and we can do the same thing\nhere or if we just want to look at one\nsubcategory and say\nlet me scroll down a bit storage now\neverything updates to storage it's\ninteresting i wouldn't have known very\nquickly that there are some states that\ndidn't have any storage sales but now\nwhen we click on storage we can tell i\nshowed you before that you can control\nclick and look at binders and storage\nand it puts those two together also in\ntableau you can drag\nand we could select all of these so we\nhave art binders envelopes fasteners\nlabels paper and storage and none of\nthose are getting sold here\ni don't know what's up with wyoming\nexcellent so now we have our sales\ndashboard and\nlet's get started on our next one our\nnext dashboard is going to be the profit\nversion of this dashboard so some of\nthese visualizations we can use again so\nlet's go to sales by region right click\nand click duplicate\nrename it to\nprofit by region\nnow you have to be careful whenever you\ngo to reuse a visualization because like\ni mentioned before you got to make sure\neverywhere\nthat sales is used you have to replace\nit with profit i'm also going to drag\nthis sheet to be\nmore at the end here after the sales\ndashboard just to keep them separate so\nthat we have the sheets that lead up to\noverall than the sheets that lead up to\nsales and then we'll have the sheets\nthat lead up to profit great so we'll\ngrab profit and drag it onto angle size\nand that updates the angle size drag it\nonto the size of the circle shouldn't\nmake a difference since we only have one\ncircle and onto the text now when i\ndragged it on it didn't do the percent\nof total anymore so let's change that\nto the quick table calculation of\npercent of total for there and for\nthe label\npercent of total there we go now we have\nour percent total again by region\nregion\nokay here's another thing since we\nduplicated that filter it's going to be\nusing that exact same filter\nyou see it's using region from sales by\nregion all the sales dashboards we don't\nwant that so let's remove out all the\nfilters here\nand these action filters that are\ngenerated by our filtering that those\ncome from\nthis\nthese are called action filters\nand it's generated when we click this\nuses filter button okay back to profit\nby region great we're clear of filters\nand let's add back in a region filter\nand this one no longer has the icon\nthat shows you that it affects multiple\nsheets which is what we want for now\nso you might want perhaps there would be\na situation where you would have two\ndashboards and you would want these\nfilters that you put on here to affect\nboth dashboards and in this case that's\nnot what i want great so\nanother one we can use the basics for is\nsales by subcategory so let's duplicate\nthat\ngreat profit by subcategory already\nexists we made this earlier tableau will\nnot allow you to make worksheet that has\nthe same name as another worksheet you\ncan\ncall it number one or since it does put\nthe title up here you can put an extra\nspace at the end or it does detect that\nspace it counts it as a different title\neven though it's the same title just\nwith a space that does cause some issues\nso like when we're looking here and\nwe're saying oh profit by subcategory i\nwant that oh this is when we made it but\nyou don't want this one you want this\none and it gets a little confusing the\nnice thing is when you're dragging\nthings onto your dashboard when you\nhover you should get a little picture\nhere of what dashboard what\nvisualization you're looking at it\nreally helps you to make your decisions\nand not just have to do it by name if\nyou're a little bit disorganized and you\nhave all these called sheet 5 sheet 7\nyou won't know exactly what that is\nright away so that little preview is\nvery helpful great profit by subcategory\nwe'll do the same thing by removing out\nall our filters so i just click on it\nand hit delete\nyou can also control click\nand then hit delete or you can drag them\noff into a space that's not the\nvisualization space great and we only\nhave some of sales right there so we'll\nchange that to profit\nand we have some negative profits there\nwe'll keep the colors the same for\nconsistency between the two dashboards\nand let's bring on\ncategory as a filter okay\nshow filter there we are and let's do\nour order date filter right now order\ndate we'll do years okay\nall the years so it gives you this\noption here because it assumes that\nyou're making a filter because you want\nthis dashboard to just be filtered to\nyour selection you can do that you can\nmake a filter that isn't exposed to the\nend user so let's say you were making a\nbig dashboard and it was just focused on\nfurniture then and you don't want them\nto be able to select a different\ncategory for because of your analysis\nyou can make that happen\nyou can just click furniture and not\nshow this by clicking hide card here but\nin this case we want to be able to make\nthis interactive\nin a lot of different ways great profit\nby subcategory exists now instead of our\nmap we're going to make an area chart\nso i'll rename this and call it\nprofit\nover time\nby category\nso we're going to\nbring on our order date into columns and\nit goes to our discrete value let's\nchange it to our continuous value so we\nget the axis let's grab\nour profit onto rows and it makes this a\nline chart we're going to change that to\nan area chart an area chart is nice\nbecause when you split it up by category\nby dragging category on a color you can\nnow see\nwhat category is responsible for how\nmuch profit like you do with a line\nchart however its area is what defines\nthat so you can see that area over time\nand do comparisons and also it stacks\nthem on top of each other so that you\ncan tell that for 2013 our profit was\naround 50 000\nreally quickly otherwise we have to add\nthat line this line here and it makes\nthese lines smaller\nand lower um more difficult to see so\nback to our profit over time by category\nso that's some of the benefits of having\nan area chart and if we wanted to go a\nlittle more detailed than year you hit\nthis plus and now we have over quarter\nwe have some negative profits that's\ninteresting but let's go back to every\nthe year great and for this one we're\ngoing to make one more pie chart so we\ncould start from scratch or we could\nduplicate our profit by region pie chart\nwhich i'm going to do we're going to do\nthis for the comparison between a pie\nchart and an area chart so it's going to\nbe profit by category\nbut not over time so right now it's\nprofit by region let's drag category\nright on top of colors there\nand now it's split up\nit's having some trouble because it's\nsplitting it by category but because of\nwe brought region onto text it's also\nsplitting it by region so we have region\nregion region region inside of this\ncategory and we don't want that so we're\ngoing to drag category right on top of\nregion here as well and now it's just\nthe three segments\nso whatever you have in this marks card\nunless it's on tooltips will affect your\nlevel of detail in the visualization\nhere when it's on tooltips sometimes it\nwon't change the level of detail but it\ncould have an effect on like so if we\nbrought oh let's do this right now so\nright now the level of detail of this\nchart does not go to the\ncategory by\nregion like it did before you can bring\nit onto detail here and it won't affect\ncolor and it won't affect labels but it\nwill change the detail and you see how\nit splits it out again this is what it\nwould look like if it's by region by\ncategory and you have much more slices\nto this pie we'll go back but if we take\nregion and put it onto tooltip it's not\nat a low enough level for that tool tip\nto make any sense so it's going to put\nthat star you see region is star that's\nbecause this section of the pi covers\nmultiple regions if we filtered the\nregion to just central now it populates\nso there are sometimes benefits to\nhaving it in there even when\nat all levels it doesn't make any sense\nbut we won't leave it there\nexcellent so you can see\nhow the color is what determines\nis a big part of what determines how\nmany slices you get the level of detail\nfor the whole chart is a big factor as\nwell on how many slices you get great\nprofit by region profit by category\nby subcategory and by\nprofit over time and we have\nour category filter we don't have our\nsubcategory filter yet we grabbed\ncategory but let's right click on\nsubcategory and click show filter there\nwe go now we have a filter for category\nand subcategory\nhere's our region one\nwe have region in two places and we\ndon't want that\nwe wanted to apply to all of them we'll\ndo that when we get to the dashboard\nand\nwe have category year of order date and\nsubcategory great those are all the\nfilters i wanted so let's build our\ndashboard\nwe'll call this our profit dashboard\nonce i get it set\nto the size i want\nprofit we'll start with profit by\nregion\nand we'll have our profit by category\nover time next to it great we'll give\nthat\nsome different space have this at the\nbottom\nhave this underneath there\nnow it's bunched all these up next to it\nso let's again drag it over to the side\nit's always good to pay attention to the\nhighlighted section and it gives you\nkind of an idea oh you see i\naccidentally dragged an individual\nfilter instead of this whole section so\nwhen i grabbed this i didn't grab all of\nthese so if you want to grab all these\nand they happen to be inside the same\nsection you can come and click select a\nlayout container and now i'm grabbing\nall of them\nthere we go\nwe'll do the same thing as before you\nknow what i'm going to make these\nfloating\nbecause then it kind of sits inside of\nthat same area i'll make that one\nfloating\nand this one too\nthis category\nlegend applies to both this chart and\nthis chart so that's very nice and this\nsubcategory legend i won't make floating\ni'll just put here by subcategory\nand this profit by category doesn't need\nquite that much space\nlet's give\nour bar chart some room\nexcellent we don't need the size of the\ncircles\nmake these\ndrop downs now um because i didn't have\nto on\nthis chart and this chart\nchange profit to dollars because we set\nthat as the default it definitely saved\nus some time so\ni recommend setting default number\nformatting\nat the beginning of your visualizations\nreally nice\nexcellent now you can rearrange the\norder of these so i like to have the\ndate at the top it's sometimes hard to\nget it to the top so i take it the\nsecond to the top and i drag the top one\ndown and then um category above\nsubcategory just for logical sense\nexcellent and we have our profit\ndashboard let's see there is this check\nbox down here called show dashboard\ntitle so if we wanted to have the title\nat the top here you can click that\nbutton any floating objects\ndon't shift down\nlike everything else did\nthere we go\nso we could have that title we could not\nhave that title\nthat's up to you excellent so at this\npoint we have our overall dashboard that\nlooks at sales and profit we have our\nsales dashboard and we have our profit\ndashboard our profit dashboard isn't 100\ncomplete because i forgot to make sure\nall of these filters apply to all of\nthese worksheets so let's go ahead and\ndo that right now\napplied worksheets selected worksheets\nall on dashboard\none thing that is nice from this view\nit's really nice to click on dashboard\nand you only see the ones on the\ndashboard but you can click here and say\nshow all worksheets in workbook and you\ncan see the rest here so if you want it\nall on the dashboard and you wanted this\none or something like that then you have\nthe option to see them all\ngreat perfect so before you ever publish\na dashboard it's always good to double\ncheck that your filters work\nwhen you filter to just one\nyear this area chart becomes a lot less\nuseful but if you're looking at two or\nmore\nyou start to see the shape of it\ngreat\nnow we're going to take a look at\nlinking from our overall dashboard\nto our sales dashboard\ngreat so we'll go to our overall\ndashboard and we'll be creating what's\ncalled an action\nso you can make an action\non\na worksheet\nyou can see right here\nactions or on a dashboard actions so\nsince we're linking between two\ndashboards this is going to be a\ndashboard action\nsorry just trying to unhighlight there\nbut if you're ever looking for an action\nyou made and you can't find it look in\nthe other one great this is our actions\ndialog box here we can see the highlight\nthat has been generated when it says\ngenerated next to it that means that you\ndidn't come in and define an action it\nwas made by\nclicking\nthis highlight button here that'll\ngenerate an action\nor when we look on our sales dashboard\nwe clicked on this uses filter button so\nwe should have several actions here that\nwere all generated\nwe have a couple different kinds of\nactions when you go to make an action\nthere's a filter action that we see when\nwe click use this filter a highlight\naction that we can see from here in\nregion and a go to url action that we\nhaven't used if you have any questions\nabout go to url please post them in the\ncomments below\nit basically allows you to be able to\nselect a url here and so\nif you had a dashboard that had to do\nwith maybe stocks you could put in a url\nhere and then put your stock ticker\nsymbol there so that you could have a\nurl that would then take you to a\nfinance website that shows you your\nstock information it can get pretty cool\nokay but we want to\nlink from this dashboard to one of our\nother dashboards and you actually do\nthat using a filter action so we're\ngoing to name that action\ngo\nto\nsales dashboard\nand we want it to happen when we click\non our sales sheet so you see right here\nit shows us the two sheets that are on\nthis dashboard when we click on the\nprofits dashboard we don't want this\naction to occur this is our go to sales\ndashboard now you can have an action\noccur on hover or select you've seen\nselect happen that's what our filter\nuses filter actions use and on menu so\nwe're going to do it on menu\nand\nthe targeted sheets it defaults to this\ndashboard saying when i click on this i\nwant the rest of this dashboard to\nupdate but instead it's going to take us\nto our sales dashboard\nso when we click on this i want these\nsheets to update\nnow we're going to define what filters\nit's going to apply by default it's\ngoing to apply all of the filters based\non what we click so if we click here it\nwill filter to just 2013 let's say we\nclick here it'll filter to just 2013 and\nit will filter to the region we selected\nso\nlet's see what happens when we do that\nokay it's just going to default okay now\nwhen i click on this it's going to\nfilter to 2013 and west go to sales\ndashboard this is where it pops up when\nyou have it on menu\nit's taken us to our sales dashboard it\nis filtered 2013 and west\njust so you know actions will not affect\nthese filters here you see that it\nthinks all of them are selected because\nit creates a separate filter there is\nsuch thing as show only relevant values\nfor these filters so if we click this it\nwill filter this to only the ones that\nare relevant so we can see that it's\nonly 2013 that this dashboard is\nfiltered down to but if we click all\nvalues in the database this filter\ndoesn't have any only one particularly\nselected it does have them all selected\nright now\nso\nwe can get here\nfor that information and to get back\nwe just need to navigate back to overall\ngreat so it works there\nbut when we click on this up here\ngo to sales dashboard\nwe get a blank dashboard now\nthat happens because\nit's trying to pass region information\nto that dashboard\nbut this doesn't have any region detail\non this line it doesn't know what that\nis so it's giving it a bad region value\nso let's fix this\ngo to our actions we're going to edit\nour go to sales dashboard and we're\ngoing to select what fields\nit'll filter on\nwe will filter on\nour order date\nyear and\nlet me go back to that\nwe click the order date year and it goes\nto the target data source sometimes your\ntarget data source will be a different\ndata source than the one that you are\nusing for your source data source now\nthat gets a little bit complicated right\nnow we're just using one data source so\nthat's not something you need to worry\nabout in a simple visualization like\nthis\nokay and we're gonna add one more\nwe're gonna add region\nand it automatically selects region over\nhere but you could select it yourself\nlet's see what happens here okay\nif\none dashboard has region in it and the\nother dashboard doesn't have region in\nit or doesn't allow you to filter by\nregion then sometimes you'll get an\nerror here\nthat will say it's missing out of your\ntarget dashboards\nso we don't have any errors so let's see\nwhat happens\nso we go to click here\ngo to sales dashboard\nwhat if\nwe\ntake out region remove region and we're\njust doing it based on year\nokay okay click here go to sales\ndashboard and there everything is so now\nit will filter back to the year that you\nselected so this is all 2013 but it will\nnot filter to the region you selected\nso even when we come here and we select\nwest\nit takes you to the dashboard but it\ndoesn't filter it to west\nyou have to do that yourself\nso now we have links\nfrom sales to\nsales\nlet's make one for profit to profit go\nto sales dashboard add action\nfilter\nwe're going to call this go to profit\ndashboard\nand we're only going to come from the\nprofit table to make this happen\nlet's go to profit and let's select our\nfields\nwe're going to do the same thing\nwhere it's only going to filter it to\nthe year now you can see oh i started to\ntype in i didn't show you this before\nbut you can search text so i started\ntyping in year and it shows you that\nunder order date you have all these\ndifferent options in this dashboard\nright now if you remember we're using\nthe continuous one that is marked by\nthe little calendar\nso that's it knows it's a calendar date\ninstead of just\ntrading it like a discrete field\nokay\nexcellent go to profit dashboard and\nthere we go this visualization like we\nsaid when it's filtered to just one year\nisn't quite as useful but one thing you\ncan do\nis for west here we can select\nboth years i'm i'm going to do it by\ncontrol clicking click\nclick\ngo to profit dashboard\nand now we've got 2015 and 2016. so\nthat's how you do linking between the\ntwo dashboards if you wanted to be able\nto include region as well\nyou could\nput a note in the tooltip for this\nthat this doesn't work for\nregion linking from this area doesn't\nwork or perhaps you could not have this\ntotal line on the same visualization you\ncould have a separate visualization that\nshows the total or an area chart instead\nand that will let you not have this\nproblem of go to sales dashboard not\nlinking appropriately\nso now we're going to create our final\ndashboard our segment dashboard and it's\ngoing to use\na parameter in it so we'll get to take a\nlook at parameters on dashboards\nso let's rename this we're going to call\nit\nprofit\nand sales\nby segment\nyou don't have to name all of your\ndashboards a description of what they\nare but it makes it really nice and easy\nand it automatically puts it up here but\nif you wanted to change this you can\njust come in here and name this whatever\nyou like and then it will just show up\nup here so\nwe could call this segment analysis\nclick apply or ok and there it goes\nthat means this and this does not have\nto be the same\nif we go forward again segment analysis\nand profit and sales by segment that\nallows you to have some\nmore useful names down here that make it\neasy when you're looking at them side by\nside but have a name to match your\ndashboard up here great so we're going\nto\nmake\na profit in sales it's going to be a\nbars and circles chart and we're going\nto bring in our segment that we haven't\nlooked at yet consumer corporate and\nhome office and then we're going to look\nat it segment and we're going to make a\nmatrix with category and we get to fill\nin this space with our\nvisualizations so we're going to do\nsales\nand it's going to make these bar charts\nso we can see for technology by consumer\nby corporate by home office and that is\na matrix of bar charts but we also want\nto be able to see profit and right now\nit's making two sets of visualizations\nbut we want just one so let's dual axis\nand it's automatically changed it to\ncircles also it is not\nsynchronizing the axis now because\nprofit is blue and these profit is not\nanywhere near the same amount as sales\nwhich makes sense you shouldn't have\nprofit that's higher than sales so let's\nsynchronize our axis\nand let's change our sales our marks\ncard over here is associated with sales\nand it's nice and easy when the two\nmarks cards are based on a different\nmeasure\nto let you know which one you're\naffecting and we'll change that to a bar\nand now we have a circle on\na bar chart now if we had profit in\nfront of sales\nyou can see how it's behind\nand you can fix that by taking it to the\nback of sales\nanother way you can fix it say you\nwanted the profit axis here over here\nfor some reason you can right click on\nthe axis and put mark type or oh move\nmarks to front\nanother way to change it we don't need\nboth of these so let's not show that\nheader and we don't need this to be\nlabeled profit because it's for both of\nthem so the way you get rid of that is\nactually you click edit axis\nand then you just erase the title\noh and you don't hit reset you just\nerase the title\nand then you close it\nso now no title here but we still have\nthe axes\nand we have three sets of bar charts\nacross excellent the next chart we're\ngoing to build oh so right now they are\nit automatically added the colors based\non measure names measure names is a\ndimension that is created by tableau and\nit's just what it sounds like we're\ncoloring it based on the different\nmeasure names one of them is named\nprofit one of them's name sales and we\nknow that you can come here click color\nand hit edit colors and it will open\nthis dialog box but you can also come\nhere and double click on a color pops\nopen that dialog box\nlet's\npick\na palette\nlet's see\nthere's a lot of different ones of these\ntableau 20\nlet's pick colors from this palette\nprofit can be\nso you click here make sure it's\nhighlighted click the color you want\nclick here make sure it's highlighted\nclick the color you want\nhit apply\nand then you can come to color and make\nit a little more opaque\nwhatever when you make it more opaque\nyou start to be able to see through your\ncircles there are benefits but also\ndrawbacks to doing that\nanyway\nso stick with the tableau orange blue\ngreat we have our first chart our next\nchart is going to be called\ntop\ncustomers\nby sales and this is where we're going\nto use our parameter where we made our\ntop end customers so\nlet's bring in\nour sum of sales make a bar chart for\nthat and then we're also going to we're\nbringing in our set now so we have our\nin and our out we're going to break up\nour set by our segment as it's part of\nour segment analysis and we'll bring in\nour customer names\nand let's sort it excellent now you can\nsee that when we sorted it it didn't\ntake this big guy and put it all the way\nat the top it just sorted it each within\nits own section great and so here we\nhave our in and out and that's not a\nsuper user-friendly title for\nour users of this dashboard they're like\nin and out of top end customers by sales\nmaybe we want this to say something a\nlittle bit more user-friendly so let's\nmake a calculated field and we're going\nto call it the top and customers\nlabel\nand we're going to go and say if\nand we're gonna use our set top end\ncustomers by sales and since it's an in\ntheir outset it treats this like\nif it's in top end customers by sales\nthen\ntop\nwe're going to\num do with string so it's going to be\ntop and then we want to use the number\nthat's in our parameter so we have to\nconvert it from a number to a string and\nwe have to concatenate them together in\ntableau you can use a plus sign top and\nalways make sure you have space between\nwhat you're concatenating together\nthat's something that i tend to forget\ntop space customers so if they pick 20\nit'll say top 20 customers\nso if it's in this set then top blank\ncustomers\nelse if it's not in the set we will just\ncall it other and in tableau you always\nneed to end your if statement with an\nend here it tells us our calculation is\nvalid while we're here i want to show\nyou a little trick there's this arrow\nbutton here\nthat can give you all of the different\nfunctions that are available within\ntableau\nand it even sorts it out by different\ncategories so if we didn't know how to\nmake this into a string we could go to\ntype conversion we could click on string\nand it gives you an example also when\nyou click on\na function in here did you see how it's\non date and then i clicked on string and\ni'm like what does this do click on it\nand it tells me so this makes it really\nuseful inside of tableau also in tableau\nyou can make a comment in here so if\nsomebody's like what's going on here you\ncan press dash dash or\nslash slash and type in\nthis is a more user-friendly\ntitle hit okay and there we go we have\nour more user-friendly title we drag it\nhere we see our top 20 customers and\nother and we don't want to show this\nanymore but we still want it in place\nyou can click right click on it up here\nand click show header and it hides it so\nthat in out is still happening there and\nlet's drag it to our filters and there\nwe have it we have our top link\ncustomers and it tells you right there\nhow many and we need to come here to\nparameter right click and click show\nparameter control and that's how we can\ncontrol\nthese changes so let's set it to 10 at\nfirst and we have it\nour top customers by sales but it's\ninteresting to know profit as well so we\nhave really big sales but how is their\nprofit doing so let's draw profit on\ncolor and you can see this person has a\nnegative amount of profit despite their\nbig sales so that's important for us to\nknow and we can change our color like we\ndid previously to go from red to blue\nand we can\nchange our center to zero\nand now we can see the negatives really\nquickly\nnow they're not the only one either i\nhave a negative profit but some of our\nhighest sales that's great to know\nexcellent those are our visualizations\nfor the segment dashboard so let's talk\nabout filters really quick we have this\nfilter we won't show the filter itself\nwe don't want to allow them to\nshow in or out we just are going to\nallow them to show how many but we do\nwant to be able to have them filter by\ncategory so let's show that filter and\nby segment\nshow that filter and and then we'll have\nour parameter great let's make our\ndashboard\num automatic as you probably read right\nthere the dashboard will resize to fit\nany screen it is displayed on that can\nbe really handy especially if your\nvisualization is really dynamic and can\nchange however some visualizations like\nthis visualization for example if it\ngets too squished you stop being able to\nread things very well so automatic has\nits definite pros and cons\nso we're gonna bring on our profit and\nsales by segment and it already pops up\nwith its legend and total customers\nby sale and it pops up with its legends\nand filters and it pops up with its\nparameter now i'm going to close that\nand be like if you don't see your\nparameter when you first bring it in the\nparameter is affecting this sheet and\nyou can go to parameters and find it but\nparameters are\nworkbook wide meaning that it's going to\nexist over here too\nit doesn't affect this sheet however\nit's still going to show up there\nbecause it could affect it is available\nfor any sheet and it's the same there is\nno determining what worksheets this\naffects this will affect any sheet that\nit is on so if i i've changed it to 10\nand if i come down here and go back to\nthe other visualization that uses it\nthis is why i should name my sheets\nlet's see if i can find it\nnope\nhere we are sheet 13. in sheet 13\nwe have our top 10. so i've got a 10 and\ni've got a 10 over there and if i change\nit to 20\nand i go back to my segment dashboard\nit is also changed to 20. so it will\naffect all sheets always very important\nto know great so here's our\nvisualization\nhere are some of the more useful legends\nso\nlet's\nmake this floating and put it over by\nthe visualization it matters for we can\ndo the same thing here floating right up\nhere floating does not work very well\nfor if you were to make this an\nautomatic dashboard so that the size\nchanges all the time because floating\ncould end up right on top of your\nvisualization and keep you from being\nable to see what you need to see\nand let's make these affect\nall the dashboards in the workbook\nagain we don't have to do this for our\nparameter\nit will already affect all the\ndashboards in the whole\nworkbook\nand\nformat these\nanother thing you should know is that\nthere are more formatting options for\nthese\nincluding edit title so it's already\nnamed it category automatically but if\nyou had\nlike here oh this is a great example\nedit title top end customers and you\ncould change it to\nselect\nnumber of top customers\nor something like that give it a little\nmore space\nand yeah these floating ones do not\nshift when you shift things so it's\nalways good to double check your\nfloating\nlegends and this is a little bit more\nuser-friendly\nthan the title we made for the\ndevelopers\nand that's using parameters in a\ndashboard\ntoday in this video we learned about an\noverview of business intelligence on\ntableau we talked about how to install\ntableau public and how to connect to a\ndata source\nwe also talked about creating calculated\nfields\nlike this one\nwe talked about making sets and\nparameters we learned how to make a\ndonut chart\nand a 2d donut chart we learned about\nmaking dashboards\nand adding filters to those dashboards\nand we also learned about connecting\nbetween dashboards today we will be\nlearning about the topics we discussed\nin part one live versus extract data\nsources we'll talk about joins and\nunions and we'll look at table\ncalculations we'll look at the rank\nfunctions and we'll look at actions\nspecifically url actions we'll talk\nabout reference lines and bands we'll\nlook into some insights in the data such\nas delay analysis also we'll learn how\nto build a waterfall chart and then\nfinally we will learn about level of\ndetail calculations while making two\ndifferent visualizations\nin part one of this tableau training we\nintroduced tableau basics and we learned\nhow to create\ndonut charts and two-dimensional donut\ncharts and we learned about linking\nbetween dashboards if you missed part\none please check out the link in the\ndescription below\nnow let's discuss the difference between\na live connection and an extract\nconnection first it's important to note\nthat these different types of\nconnections are not available in tableau\npublic it's always a live connection and\na live connection is where the data will\nupdate based on when the source of the\ndata updates so if any if you're\nconnected to a database and something in\nthe database changes then you'll pick up\nthose changes when you open the report\nas it will query that database\nwhen the report is opened whereas an\nextract connection is extracted into\ncreates a subset of the data that\nimproves performance so when you're\nlooking at it locally on your computer\nyou have an extract of that data set\nthat subset of the data right on your\ncomputer or up in tableau server\ndepending on where you're looking at it\nand it does not update\nwhen the database updates it only\nupdates when your refresh updates it so\nwithout a refresh set for that extract\nyou won't get the new data as an example\nof this let's say\nthat in our\nsample superstore we have kelly williams\nassociated with the central region but\nthat's changed so let's go ahead and\nchange that\nwe will change it to\nsarah smith\nand\nwe'll save it\nnow let's go back to our tableau\nworkbooks\nand you can see we can refresh it over\nhere and see sarah smith come in over\nhere in our extract\nit sarah smith doesn't come in\nif we click to refresh the extract it\ndoesn't refresh the extract until we\nnavigate to sheet 1\nbut when we go back to our data source\nthen we see sarah smith coming in so\nthat refresh can be scheduled and it\ncould run once a day\nor once every several hours\nbut you would need to set up a refresh\nor else you would never get sarah\nsmith's data coming in\nnext let's talk about joining data in\ntableau so here we have the people table\nbut let's say we want to join it to our\norders information so i'm going to start\nwith our orders table\nand then we're going to pull on people\nand tableau is going to\ncreate a join for us and it's going to\nchoose the column that we would like to\njoin on based on the names in the two\ndata sources so if these two data\nsources didn't have a column that had\nthe same name then tableau wouldn't be\nable to guess\nwhat\ntwo to join on\nso we would have to come in and select\nout of the order side and the people\nside\nwhat we'd like to join on and then we\nhave the options to do an inner join a\nleft join a right join and a full outer\njoin let's review quickly what these\nlook like so say we had two tables that\nwe wanted to join together one of them\nwas the student table that had the\nstudent names and the key\nto their grade\nand which we could use to look up their\ngrade over here in the grade table which\nhad the key to their grade and the\nactual grade a b c d f and incomplete\nwe can see here that somebody has made a\nmistake and put in a letter grade\ninstead of the key to the letter grade\nand we'll see how that affects what\nwe're looking at\nso if we were to do an inner join\nthat would only take\nthe rows where the join could complete\nso\nwe have one that could join to one just\nfine but we don't have two and we don't\nhave three a doesn't join to anything so\nthis row would be not included and then\nfour\nfive and six would all join so that\nwould look something like this where we\nwould see adam\nwhen we grab student from this table and\ngrade from this table we can see adam\nhad an a beverly had an a dale had a d\nelizabeth had an f and frank is\nincomplete and charles is missing also\nyou don't see any b or c in this list of\ngrades\nfor a left join\nit's going to take everything\nfrom the left table\nand only the pieces from the right table\nthat apply to the left table so it looks\npretty similar to our inner join\nonly charles shows up so the join wasn't\nable to complete since a doesn't exist\nin grade but we include charles anyways\nand grade becomes null for charles it\nwon't put in the grade key because it's\nwe're not asking for the grade key we're\nasking for grade from the grade table so\nwe try to look up a inside of the grade\ntable we can't find it and never\ntolerance no we look up a inside the\ngrade key perfect right join is like a\nleft join only it takes everything from\nthe right table instead of the left\ntable\nso it grabs all the grades a b c d f and\nincomplete and only the rows from the\nleft table that\njoin appropriately\nso since charles doesn't join\nappropriately he doesn't show up we also\nhave b and c showing up even though it\ndoesn't exist in the student table\nand it won't be tied to a student\nbecause that join wasn't able to\ncomplete as it didn't exist over there\nand the last one is a full outer join\nwhere it takes everything from both\ntables whether or not the join is\ncomplete so\nwe have all of the people where the join\ncompletes we also have charles where the\njoin doesn't complete from the left to\nthe right and we have b and c where the\njoin doesn't complete from the right to\nthe left\nso those are our options in tableau\nhere\nin our sample superstore data set\nyou could look and see if there are any\nregions in the orders table that don't\nexist in the people table and that's how\nyou can know what kind of join you want\nand so if you want those orders to still\nshow up even though they don't have a\nregion\nor their region is\nnot in\nthe people table that's when you would\ndo a left join\nfor our purposes\nwe'll do an inner join\nnow let's say\nwe had a second\nexcel sheet\nhere that had more\norders and you can do a union\nwhich is just adding more orders\nby dragging that second orders table\nright underneath the original orders\ntable you can see it says their drag\ntable to union and that's helpful for if\nyou have an excel sheet for maybe\ndifferent years so say you had a\nseparate excel sheet for the orders in\n2015 and then another one for the orders\nin 2016 you could pull on your 2015\norders and then drag your 2016 orders\nright there to union and it would take\nthese orders and then\nadd the rows instead of the columns for\nthe 2016 orders\nfor example we've added people\nbut as a join and that will\nfirst put in all of our orders\nas columns and then add the columns for\nour person\nbut if we were adding more data that\nfell under the order\ncolumns so it would have the same data\nthe same order id ship date but we\nwanted to add more rows then that would\nbe one new union now we're going to take\na look at calculations and which ones\nare calculated on the database side\nversus which are calculated on the table\nside\nso here we have percentage of total\nsales split up by subcategory and\ncategory\nwe also have\npercentage of total sales along table\ndown so the difference between these two\nthings are one of them is made using\na calculated field\nwhich is where we do the sum of sales\ndivided by the sum of fixed sum of sales\nthis part is called a level of detail\ncalculation\nand this calculation the sum of sales\nand the sum of the level of detail of\nsales\nwhich basically makes the database find\nthe total\nsum of sales regardless of\nthese dimensions we pulled on\nso it gives us our total number so this\nwill be sum of sales for bookcases and\nthis will be sum of sales for everything\nthis calculation is done on the database\nside\nwhereas this one\npercentage of total sales along table\ndown is what's called a table\ncalculation\nit's a quick table calculation of\npercent of total and it is done\nin tableau\nit's processed locally right inside of\nthe table after the aggregations have\noccurred\nthere are some pros and cons of doing it\nthis way so\nfor\nthis percent of total sales\ni had to create the table calculation\nhere\nand it does the fixed\nsum of sales where it finds the sum of\nsales for the entire database\nand since it is fixed it will ignore\nfilters so for example\ni took off both of the sales and i'm\njust going to put on the percent sum of\nsales\nand let's say we wanted to see\nhow\noffice supplies and technology are as\npercentages of sum of sales\nand ignore furniture so we can grab\ncategory and we'll control\nclick and drag\nand we're going to unselect furniture\nand hit ok\nnow it's still\ntaking it out of the total sum of sales\nincluding furniture and so our grand\ntotal down here is only 67 percent\ninstead of 100\nwhereas\nif we take\nsales\nand double click it and it adds it over\nhere on the table then we right click\nand do a quick table calculation\nand click\npercent of total\nthis one is doing it out of 100 and\nthese numbers don't match and that's\nbecause it does take into account the\nfilter of category so let's pull the\nfilter of category off and we can see\nthat they're both out of a hundred\npercent now and each of these take into\naccount\num\nthe same amount of data since we have no\nfilters here\nso if you wanted to take into account\nthe filters on the table\nthen you need to use a table calculation\nhowever when you push the information\nback to the database to do the\ncalculation it's doing it as part of the\nquery to the data source and it can save\nyou some time and so which one of these\nis faster sort of depends on\nwhat data is available already when the\noriginal query comes back\nnext we're going to discuss ranking in\ntableau first let's add a second data\nsource so we can do that by coming up to\ndata and clicking new data source\nor you can just click this plus data\nsource right here and click microsoft\nexcel\nwe're going to use this rank example\nworksheet\nperfect and it's already pulled in the\nsheet we want because there's only one\nsheet\nand we'll go to sheet2\npull on store\npull on sales\nand we will rename sheet2\nas\nrank example\ngreat so now we have here's all of our\nstores and here are our sales and if we\nwanted to rank them\nbased on who had the highest sales to\nthe lowest sales\nwe could create a calculated field\ncalled ranked by sales\nand we're going to use our rank\nfunction\nand we're going to put in sales now we\nreceive this error here so when we hover\nwe see what that arrow says oh you can\nclick and it says all fields must be\naggregate or constant when using table\ncalculation functions or fields from\nmultiple data sources so we learn\nsomething unique here\nthat you might not know is that a rank\nis a table calculation\nand it requires it to be aggregated\nso\nwe can make sum and put the parentheses\naround sales\nand our error goes away so now we know\nrank is a table calculation\nand we have our box here that expands\nout and can teach us about what we're\nusing here so when i click on rank it\nwill tell us that it returns the\nstandard competition rank for the\ncurrent row\nand it says identical values are\nassigned an identical rank so let's see\nwhat that looks like we'll hit ok\nwe'll double click on rank by sales and\nwe can see our ranks so e had the\nhighest sales so it's one\nd is next and c and b are tied\n20 and 20\nand so they both share the rank of three\nand then because they are two of them\nthat share the same rank we skip four\nand the next one gets fifth place\nbut now this isn't the only way to rank\nso let's make another one of these\nwe'll click duplicate\nand edit\nlet's erase copy\nand we're going to call this rank dense\nby sales double click on rank start\ntyping rank again and we're going to\nclick rank dense\nnow the difference here is that rank\ndense returns the rank where identical\nvalues are assigned an identical rank\nbut no gaps are inserted in the numbers\nso click ok double click rank dense and\nyou can see instead of going one two\nthree five\nit goes one two three four\nso it doesn't include that gap now let's\ngive them a little bit more space here\nand maybe i want it to be in the order i\ncreated it so these measure values are\ndefining what's going to happen up here\nso we can take sales and put it at the\ntop\nand that'll move sales to the front and\nput rank dense at the bottom so now we\ncan see sales we can see rank by sales\nwe rank dents by sales\nnow let's duplicate\nand\nlook at the next one\nwe have\nrank modified\nnext\nand\nchange the name here you notice that i\nreceive an error\nand that's because that name already\nexists tableau won't allow you to use\nthe same name\nand it will give you that error so those\nerrors can be pretty helpful in finding\nout what's going on hit apply\nand okay and then double click rank\nmodified by sales\nand now we can see\nthe difference here\nlet's go back here and\nlook at what it says here click on ring\nmodified and it says it returns the\nmodified competition rank where\nidentical values are assigned an\nidentical rank\nbut\nwhat happens instead\nis instead of both receiving three\nfor third place\nthey both receive four\nwhich is the lower of the options so if\nwe were going by rank and we just\narbitrarily decided that this one's\nthird place and this one's fourth place\nthen they both received the same rank\nhere but they receive the higher of the\ntwo options whereas this one receives\nthe lower of the two options\nand let's do one more\nduplicate\nedit\nerase copy\nand we're going to do\nrank\nunique\nand let's change the name\nto rank unique\nperfect and now this is going to give it\na unique\nranking even when they share the same\nnumber so we'll hit apply\nokay double click rank unique\nand we have one two\nthree four and five\nso what it's doing is\nlet's quickly look here so\nrank by sales\nwe haven't talked about this yet but you\ncan choose to rank it\nascending or descending that means that\ndo we want to rank it based on\nwhether you see here it says ascending\nor descending and that's how you will\ndefine so it defaults to descending and\nit's saying the biggest is the best\nso\nin for sales that's accurate so what\nit's doing is biggest down now here it\nhas to decide which one to give three\nand which one to do for\nand it's doing that based on the ascii\nvalues\nof the store\nso it's looking at more information on\nthe row and since uppercase b comes\nbefore lowercase c uppercase b is\ngetting the three\neven though they both have 20 for sales\nlet's go back now to our orders data\nand we'll make a new sheet and now we're\ngoing to talk about actions in tableau\nwe've talked about actions briefly\nbefore\nin our tableau training video for\nbeginner so if you want to see the\nintroduction you can go and look there\nalso if you want to follow along with\nour data sets you can comment below and\nask and the simply learn team will get\nyou that data set\nso let's make a chart where we're going\nto look at\ncategory so we'll drag category onto\ncolumns and then we're going to look at\nsales so we'll drag sales onto rows and\nit will create three bar charts for us\nand we're going to\ncall this\nsales by category\nnow let's make a second chart that we\nwill use together and we'll bring\ncategory onto columns and we'll bring\nsubcategory onto columns\nand let's bring sales\nonto rows again\nand let's\ntake\nsubcategory and bring it on to color and\nthat makes each subcategory its own\ncolor and we'll call this sheet\nsales by subcategory\nso now back to sales by category here\nyou can make a worksheet action\nwhere we're going to\nmove from the sales by category sheet to\nthe sales by subcategory sheet and also\nfilter down that sheet to only the\ncategory we want to see\nso click filter\nand we can name this filter\ngo to subcategory\nand we're going to do this filter on\nselect so this name won't be seen except\nfor in our actions list and what sheets\ndo we want to affect we're going to have\nsales by category show up one thing to\nnote here it is only showing the sheets\nfor it to affect based on the ones that\nare using this data source\nat this point so you can see we have\nfour sheets down here but it's only\nshowing three sheets and that's because\nrank example if you recall is using the\nrank example data source so you can\nclick here and you can see all the\nsheets or you can see the other\ndata source if we click rank example it\nwill show the rank example data source\nso we just want sales by category to be\nthe source sheet\nand the target sheet we want it to be\nsales by subcategory\nso on select we want it to be sales by\nsubcategory we're going to use all the\nfields available\nto create this filter and hit ok so now\nwe have our go to subcategory on select\nwe'll hit ok again\nand\nlet's\nmake this a little wider so we can see\nand so when we click on furniture it\nwill take us to only furniture of\nthe sales by subcategory we go back to\ncategory we click on office supplies now\nwe just see office supplies and this is\na way to make tableau drill to a lower\nlevel\ngreat so we have those\nnow let's duplicate this sales by\ncategory sheet\nand let's see if we go to worksheet and\nwe go to\nactions\nyou can see that we have the action here\ngo to subcategory that still exists on\nour duplicated sheet as well so you can\nsee it's affecting both sheets\nsales by category and sales by category\ntwo let's say we don't want that and we\ncan\nunselect sales by category two\nand hit okay\nand hit okay\nnow when we go to worksheet actions\nyou can tell that it's not affecting\nthat sheet so if we come and click\ntechnology nothing should happen but we\ngo to sales by category and click\ntechnology it'll take you to the\ntechnology subcategory\ngreat so we have our sales by category\ntwo let's bring it to the end\nrename it\nwe're going to call it sales by category\nstacked\nbecause we're going to take subcategory\nhere and drag it onto color\nand now we can see our different\nsubcategories\nin the colors there\nnow we can take a look\nhere\nand sort by\nsubcategory based on some of sales\nand now you can see that\nit is the biggest sales at the bottom\nfor each sub category that's just\na way that i like to view it so\nlet's do a highlight action and we're\ngoing to do it on a dashboard\nso let's take sales by\nsubcategory\nand look at it over top of our sales by\ncategory stacked over top of sales by\nsap category so we want both of those\nlet's make our\ndashboard automatic for\ntesting purposes\nand we'll go to dashboard we'll click\ncreate actions so we're going to add an\naction it's going to be a highlight\naction\nhighlight sales by subcategory\nand we are going to have the\nsales by category stacked be the source\nsheet and the sales by subcategory be\nthe target sheet for all fields okay\nokay and on select you can highlight\nyour chart there\nand see where it falls inside of the\nother visualization\na cool thing you can do is you could\nselect office supplies here and it will\nhighlight all of office supplies or if\nyou drag and select a couple of them it\nwill show you those so you're just like\ni want to see all these small ones or i\nwant to see\nthis one and these small ones or\nwhatever then it will highlight the ones\nthat you drag and select now this is\nalso true of our sales by subcategory\nand sales by category so when we clicked\non technology it filtered to just\ntechnology\nand we'll undo that and when we drag and\nclick office supplies and technology we\nget office supplies and technology now\nif we go back to the dashboard we can\nsee that this dashboard is now filtered\nalso to office supplies and technology\nand that's because we're using the same\nsheet\nand when you navigate away from that\nsheet it doesn't mean that your filter\ngoes away\nso when i clicked undo that's when it\ncaused the filter to go away so\nif you're going to have two\nthings affect that sheet\njust remember that just because you\nnavigated away from what you selected\ndoesn't mean that what you selected\ngoes away that filter will stay there it\nshows up right here\nand if we pull it off everything goes\nback to normal however the action is\nstill there so when you click on it it\ncomes back\nnow let's take a look at the last kind\nof action which is a url action\nso we're going to make a map based on\nstate so i'm going to double click state\nand it's going to build out my map let's\nchange it to a field\nmap\nby clicking map up here\nand we're going to take sales and put it\nonto color\nso now it's colored based on the darkest\nis the highest sales\nwe're going to put state onto label so\nyou can see the state name and we're\ngoing to put sales on to label\nso we can see the sales amount let's\nquickly\nchange our default property for sales\nso that it always shows up as currency\nand we're going to\nlose the decimal places\nso it'll by default show up with a\ndollar sign and\nso on\ngreat so now we have our sales map and\nwe're going to create\na worksheet action now the difference\nbetween a worksheet action and a\ndashboard action is that a worksheet\nwill only affect the worksheet and\ndashboard will only affect the dashboard\nand so when we created our worksheet\naction on sales by category if we were\nto pull sales by category onto the\ndashboard that action won't transfer\nover you'll need to make a dashboard\naction\nso we're gonna make a go to url action\nwe're going to have it on menu\nwe're going to call it wiki\nand it's going to only affect\nour new sheet\nsheet 6 which we should rename and we're\ngoing to have a url in here so this will\ntake us to wikipedia and then whatever\nyou put at the end of the wikipedia link\nit will take you to that page on\nwikipedia so\nwe're going to take state and add it to\nthe end of that link\nand now to test the link you can just\nclick test link\nand it will take a random value and show\nyou what it will look like\nso now that's how we know that we have\nour link set up\nokay click okay let's rename our sheet\nto\n[Music]\nurl\nfilter by state\nand so when we click on texas\nokay back to url filter by state let's\ngo to our worksheets\nand go to our actions and on the go to\nsubcategory\nis also affecting this url filter by\nstate because we didn't unselect it now\nto keep that from being a problem we're\ngoing to just come here and sales by\ncategory\nbe the only sheet and that way it won't\nauto select no sheets as you create them\nso we'll no longer have that problem you\nclick on texas and nothing happens\nexcept for it highlights that one only\nthat's how it should be but when we\nhover on texas and wait long enough oh\nyeah on click sometimes you just have to\nhold still it'll come up with our little\nlink here and we click on wiki and it\nwill open up\nour browser with the wikipedia page for\ntexas this can become really handy in\nthe event that you have data that maybe\nhas an order id and you can take that\norder id and insert it into a url in\nyour system so that it can take you to\nyour web interface page for that order\nhere it's helpful for if we wanted to\nlearn more about the state of california\nwhich it can have information about the\nlanguages spoken\nand population\nwhich can be helpful when we're looking\ninto our sales information\nanother way this can be useful is by\nshowing the web page right inside of\ntableau so let's make a dashboard\nchange our size to automatic and let's\npull in url filter by state\nif we go to dashboard actions you can\nsee there are no actions for this\ndashboard yet so we're going to add a go\nto url action\non select\nand since it's on select the name of\nthis url won't\nshow up\nbut it will show up in our list here so\nit's nice to name it something unique\nlet's put in our wikipedia page and\nit'll take us to state so we'll hit ok\nokay and now when we click on oklahoma\nit'll open up a page for oklahoma\nbut let's unselect oklahoma if we drag\non web page from the objects here\nyou don't even have to enter anything\nfor your url you just hit ok and now we\nhave the bottom half of the screen is a\nweb page and when we click on oklahoma\ninstead of taking us to oklahoma in a\nseparate thing it'll take us to oklahoma\nright here\nin the visualization so we'll change it\nto texas and this will change to texas\nif you unselect it leaves the page there\nbased on the one that you had just\nselected\nnext we're going to take a look at\nreference bands and lines so let's make\na new sheet\nand we're going to call it\nreference\nlines\nand so a reference line is found on the\nanalytics pane\nand it is something that comes and draws\na line on your visualization based on\nthe data on the screen so\nlet's make\nour visualization we'll do our category\nand sub category again\nand we'll double click on sales\nand it brings it onto text that's not\nwhat i want so let's do sales onto rows\nand we have our bar charts\nand\nwe'll talk about the difference between\na cell a pane and the table so when we\ngo to analytics\nand we go to drag our reference line\nonto\nour visualization it says you can add\nthe reference line for the whole table\nfor a pain or for a cell\nso\nif we\ntake our subcategory and drag it onto\ncolor\nsince the subcategory is our lowest\nlevel it's going to define our cell\nso each one of these if we drag our\nreference line onto\nso each one of them gets a reference\nline you see how it added those on this\nis our dialog box we will look at that\nin just a moment\nso let's remove that if we take\nreference line and put it onto pane\nthat's going to be similar to have a\ncategory on the color so each of these\ndifferent colors\nis now a pane\nreference line onto pane and you see how\nwe get reference lines\nbased on each pane\nso let's undo that\nand now if we take category off and\neverything is all one color and we take\nreference line and put it onto table\nnow we have our reference line for the\nwhole table\ngreat so we're going to do\nfind out the average for each\nsection\nso i'm going to take category put it\nback onto color and we'll take reference\nline and put it onto pain\nnow we have our reference line it's\nbased on the computation of average\nand it's using the value of sum of sales\nso since it says sum of sales here you\nmight think that it is taking the cut\nreference line and putting it at the sum\nof the sales but that's not what's\nhappening it's just using our aggregated\nversion of sales to figure out the\naverage so instead of taking each\nindividual sale that makes up the\nbookcase section it's taking the sum of\nsales for the bookcase section and\ncomparing it to the sum of sales for\nchairs\nso it's taking an average across these\nadded up sections\nwe could also have it be\ntotal\nwhere it's adding all of these up and it\nmakes that total line the sum line is\nthe same as total in this case a\nconstant which is where you get to\ndefine the value and so if we wanted it\nto be 200\n000 there it is\nlet's go back\nthere we are back to where we were\nconstant minimum which shows you the\nminimum for each section\nthe maximum for each section\nor the average or the median so let's\nstick with average and now you can see\nit's labeling the line as average we\ncould also have it label the line as the\nvalue so now we can see that the average\nis this amount of dollars\nor you can choose custom and then you\ncan put something in here\nlike maybe we wanted the computation a\ncolon\nand then the value average\nthis amount\nyou can also have a show recalculated\nline for highlighted or selected data\npoints that means when you click on a\nsection it will recalculate the average\njust for what you've selected we'll hit\nok\nand so in that case when we click on\ntables\nyou can see our\nrecalculated average line\nso the average for tables for just\ntables is the sum divided by the number\nso the sum of tables is 206 966 divided\nby 1 is still 206 966 so selecting just\ntables is really helpful but if we\nwanted to know the average of\ntables and we'll control click\nappliances and we'll control click\nbinders oh there we go all three of\nthose are selected we can see the\naverage of those three which is this\nline\nyou could also select like this\nand see your new average\noh and it's doing the average\nindependently so\nselect these guys and now we see the\naverage of just those\nfive categories and those are reference\nlines\nnow let's duplicate this sheet\nand i'll show you how to delete a\nreference line\nso we'll rename this to reference\nbands\nclick on this reference line\nright click and click remove\nand it takes it off we have the same\nthing for reference bands we had with\nreference lines where you can have it be\nfor the whole table per pane or purcell\nso let's do a reference band for the\nwhole table so it's doing entire table\nand it's taking from the minimum to the\nmaximum\nnow we could change the minimum to be\nthe average to the maximum and now that\nwill highlight the whole table\neverything that's above the average\nbecomes highlighted\nand if you wanted to change it you could\ndo the minimum to the average\nbut let's go to\naverage to\nmaximum and then you can change things\nlike you can add lines so we have a line\nfor the average or the maximum you can\nmake it thinner you can make it dotted\nyou can change your fill so maybe if you\ndon't want it to be quite that dark you\ncan change it to be a little bit of a\nlighter color of gray\nand you can have show recalculated band\nfor highlighted or you can remove that\nand that way when we highlight stuff\neverything just stays where it belongs\nfor the entire table\nand that's how you create a reference\nband\nreference bands and reference lines can\nbe really handy in making\nseveral different kinds of\nvisualizations such as bullet charts\nif you have any questions about that\nplease comment below and the simply\nlearn team will get back to you now\nlet's do another analysis on average\ndays to ship\nand for this one we're going to\nlook at it by state\nand we're going to look at it by\nship mode\nand so we'll take average stasis ship\nand put it on columns\nand now we can see\nthe average days to ship by first class\nsame day second class or standard class\nand you can see\nhow they differ so let's\nchange the order of these really quick\nif we come up here to ship mode and we\nclick sort and we click manual we can\nhave same day above first class so that\nit kind of goes in order of priority so\nsame day first class second class\nstandard class\nthere we go and now we have it in\norder of what you might expect and\npriority and now we're going to create a\ncalculated field that we will use to do\na sort of conditional formatting\nand we will name it delay analysis\ngreat so let's do\nif\nthe\naverage days ship\nis less than or equal to 2\nthen we'll have it return the words\nshipment early\nso\nif we want to press enter there that\nwon't cause any problems to our\ncalculation so you can press enter you\ncould have extra spaces and it won't uh\ntableau will ignore those so this allows\nus to format our calculated field in a\nway that's easy to read so if it's less\nthan two then they're going to call it\nan early shipment\nelse if\naverage days to ship is greater than or\nequal to five\nthen shipment\nlate\nand else if let's get the rest of them\nand\naverage days to ship is\nnot less than two\ngreater than two\nand less than\nfive then\non time\ntwo words\nand now you can see we have an error\nhere\nit says expected end to match if that\nmeans that we don't have an end\nat the end of our if statement\nif statements always have to have an end\nokay let's hit apply\nand let's grab our delay analysis and\nput it on to color\nand it has on time as blue\nearly shipment\nas orange\nand shipment linked as red\nwe could double click on the color and\nwe can change shipment early to green\nand now we can see\nthe best ones the on-time ones and the\nones that stand out as late\nand standard class happens late a lot\nit's interesting to see that on average\nthe district of columbia\nhas second class as a legit late\nshipment\nyou can see that all of these\nshare\nthe same axis size so they all go from\nzero to six\neven though this one never gets that\nclose to six\nif we click edit axis\nyou can choose if you want that to be\nthe case so it's like right now all of\nthem use uniform axis range for all rows\nand columns and that's really nice\nbecause it's easy to compare colorado to\ncolorado to colorado if you change it to\nindependent axis for each rose you can\nsee now this one only goes from zero to\nnot even one whereas this one goes from\nzero to six\nand you can compare it with color but\nyou can no longer compare it with size\nacross all of these different categories\nso uniform access range is the default\nin this case\nand we will keep it that way\nso now we have a quick analysis of our\ndelays\nwe're now going to build a waterfall\nchart\nbased on profit\nso we'll call this our profit\nwaterfall\nand um we'll take a look at what a\nwaterfall\nlooks like at the end and talk about how\nit works\nso after we build it we'll talk about\nsome of the benefits of having a\nwaterfall chart so what we're going to\ndo is build it over time for this\nvisualization we're just going to look\nat the year of 2014\nso i'm going to filter it to the order\ndates for 2014\nand then we're going to take our order\ndate and bring it onto columns and we're\ngoing to look at it by month but we're\ngoing to look at it by\nour discrete month\nso you can see that i chose the one that\nhas month and year\nand then i chose discrete\nand then we're going to take profit and\nput it onto rows\nand we're going to change it from\nprofit\nto\nour running total of profit\nso you can see that it takes january and\nthen it adds february to it\nand so it's always getting bigger when\nwe undid it sometimes there's up and\ndown\nso\nback to we only have our running total\nwhere it will some january and february\nfor the february mark and then some\njanuary february march for the march\nmark\nif i take profit\nand put it here you can see january is\nnegative three thousand and february is\npositive two thousand but here it's the\nsum of those which is negative 467.\ntake that back off we're going to change\nour marks to a gaunt bar\nand now we're going to\nduplicate profit\nand edit what we have\nwe're going to call this negative\nprofit\nand it's going to be just profit\nwith the negative sign in front\noh it looks like i've done this before\nso\nnow we have a new name because i added a\nspace at the end so hit apply\nand let's um delete the old one\nokay so now we have our negative profit\njust to look at it it's just minus\nprofit\nand we're going to use that to determine\nthe size\nof the gaunt bar\nso\nwhat it does\nis it takes where the line was and adds\nthe size of it to be the size of profit\nbut because the line was at the top and\nwe didn't want to build the profit up we\nhad to change it to negative profit so\nit would build it down\nso here the line was down here because\nit was so low negative and we added\nnegative profit\nand then let's take profit and put it on\ncolor\nand so you can see where profit is\nnegative it turns orange\nand when profit is positive it turns it\nblue so what's happening here what we\ncan do now is we can see our total sales\nat the end and how we got there so for\nthe first month we were at zero when we\nstarted and we went down to negative\nthree thousand the next month we were at\nnegative three thousand when we started\nand it grew up to be almost back to zero\nand then we can see that from there on\nout we grew up\neach month and you can see how much each\nmonth contributed\nour biggest contributors are november\nand march november being a little bit\nbigger\nand you can see where we started at the\nbeginning of that month and where we\nended and that's how a waterfall chart\nworks so it lets you go through over\ntime and see exactly where our problems\nwere\nand exactly which months helped the most\nwhere we started and where we ended for\neach month\nnext we're going to talk about level of\ndetail calculation and we'll talk about\nthose first by showing an example so i'm\ngoing to bring all my customers on\nby name and then i'm going to bring on\norder id\nand it's going to add all members but\nthen i'm going to change order id\nfrom a dimension to\na measure and we have account distinct\nso now we can see each customer and how\nmany\norders they have so let's sort it and we\ncan see one person has 17 orders and we\nhave\n1 2\n3 4\n5 6 7\npeople have 13 orders\nand it goes on from there\nso what if we wanted to make a\nvisualization that would show\nhow many customers\nhad how many orders and what\nnumber of orders was the most popular\nwe would need to do a level of detail\ncalculation so let's clear the workbook\na level of detail calculation allows you\nto build a visualization\nand bring on metrics that are at a level\nthat is different from what's shown on\nthe visualization\nso\nin order to do this\nwe need to\ncreate a calculated field\nthat will show us\nthe number of orders per customer\neven though we're not going to have our\nvisualization be per customer\nso let's call this orders\nper customer\nand we'll come here and we're going to\nuse a level of detail calculation called\nfixed\nnow there are\ntwo other level of detail calculations\nand they are called include\nand exclude\nand you can learn more about those\nin\nsome of our simply learn classes and if\nyou have any questions please comment\nbelow and we can answer them\nso we're going to do it fixed\nand you can choose\ndimensions and it computes an\naggregation using only the specified\ndimensions\nso it will ignore all the other\ndimensions and we're going to have it\nbased on customer name\nso we're going to have fixed customer\nname\nand we're going to call\nget account distinct\nof order id\nand make sure you close it with your\ncurly bracket and we have no errors and\nwe'll hit ok\nand this allows us to see number of\norders per customer so\nlet's pull it out\nfirst let's make it a dimension\nand then pull it out onto our columns\nand now we can see\n1 2 3 four five six seven eight up to\n17. so that means we had\nsome customers just order one and some\ncustomers order 17 and we had them order\neverything in between so if we'd never\nhad a customer that had nine orders\nthen 9 wouldn't appear in this list\nnow we're going to take customer\nid or name\nlet's do id because it should be unique\nand we'll pull it onto rows and we're\ngoing to change it to a measure\nand it's going to be\naccount distinct\nand so now we can see\nhow many customers ordered\nhow many items\nso\nwe have our number of orders per\ncustomer which is at the per customer\nlevel even though this visualization is\nnot at the per customer level\nthere's nowhere in this visualization\nwhere we pull on the customer\nitem as a dimension\nso let's sort it biggest smallest\nand we can see that 134 of our customers\nordered five items or had five orders\nand so it just five is the most popular\nseven is the next most popular 17 is the\nleast popular one is relatively\nunpopular which is interesting to know\nand so you can use this to analyze how\nmany items your customers generally\norder and maybe if they have four items\nthat they are going to order that\nperhaps if you made good suggestions you\ncould get them to go up to five\nand that's an introduction to level of\ndetail\nso let's name this sheet\nlevel of detail lod\norders per\ncustomer\nperfect\nnow let's make a new sheet\nand we are going to\ndo an analysis about new customers\nso we'll call this level of detail\nnew customer\nanalysis\nso this visualization is going to be\nabout customer acquisition over time so\nwhen we do things over time we grab our\ndate and pull it up here and for a line\nchart or anything over time\nwe're going to\nuse these\nso that it makes an axis\ninstead of just\nchange to line\ninstead of dimensions or something that\nis not continuous and then we're going\nto take our customer id\npull it onto rows but let's change it to\nkind of distinct customer id and now we\ncan see our count of customers on every\nday i think day is too low of a level\nlet's go ahead and month\nso now we can see how many customers\nmade an order during what month\nlet's take region\nand split it out by region\nwe click on central we can see central\nnow this is including all customers but\nsay we only wanted to include a customer\nwhen they're making their very first\norder\nso we're only going to include their\nfirst order so we need to create a\ncalculated field\nand we want to compare\nwe'll call it new or existing\nand we want to compare their order date\nper customer\nto their first order date the min\norder date\nnope\norder date\nand we're going to get this error it\nsays cannot mix aggregate which is min\nand non-aggregate functions and what\nit's saying here is that\nthis order date is at a per row level\nsince we don't have any aggregation on\nit and this order date is at a per\nvisualization level so it's only going\nto split up based on\nthe visualization and it won't let you\nput those two things together so we're\ngoing to\nuse our level of detail calculation\nagain\nand we're going to make this fixed per\ncustomer id\nand then we'll do our min\norder date\nso now instead of\ntrying to return something different\nbased on the visualization it will\nalways return the min for each customer\nid\nso if the order date on the\nvisualization is equal to this order\ndate\nif the order date on the visualization\nis equal to the first order date for\nthat customer\nthen\nnew\nelse\nexisting\nend\nso\nwhen the order date equals the very\nfirst order date that means that it's a\nnew\ncustomer making their first order\notherwise it's an existing customer\nbecause it's no longer their earliest\ndate\napply\nokay and now we can take our new field\nwhich is new or existing drag it onto\nfilters\nand we only want new\nwe'll hit apply\nand we can see that we have new\ncustomers\nbut\nless over time\nso\nso now we're going to change this\ncount distinct\nto be a running total and we can see\nover time\nhow\nour new customers are adding up so it's\ntaking the prior value and adding our\nnew customers and then at the end we get\nour total customers for each\nregion and we can now make this a more\nthe lowest level which is day\nand you can see\nplaces where it like levels out so we\ncan see we have a lot of new customers\nand it's increasing but then here for\nthe region of east there kind of is a\nlevel spot where we're not getting new\norders\nand that seems to be the same for each\nof them so for february of 2014 why were\nwe not getting any new orders\nand how come the west region is getting\nnew customers how come the west region\nis getting new customers faster here\nwhile it's leveling out in the red it\nlooks like the west region\nleveled out as well but picked up sooner\nand started getting new customers\nso this type of analysis will help you\nview\nnew customers over time\nand it's only possible because we were\nable to do a level of detail calculation\nhere on new or existing\nthat would compare\nthis data at\nonly aggregating the data for the\nspecified dimension so we were able to\ngrab their minimum order date here so\nthose are a couple of ways that level of\ndetail calculations can be very helpful\nin summary today we learned about\nlive versus extract tableau\ndata sources we learned about joins and\nunions in the data sources we also\nlooked at table versus database\ncalculations we looked at how the\ndifferent ranks compare\nwe built some actions into our\ndashboards filter actions and\nhighlighting actions we also looked at\nurl actions we built dashboards that\nused reference lines and ones that used\nreference bands we did analyzing of\naverage days to ship\nand delay analysis\nwe built a waterfall chart\nand we also looked into some level of\ndetail calculations and that brings us\nto the end of this video tutorial on\nbusiness intelligence full course i hope\nyou liked it if you have any questions\nthen please feel free to put them in the\ncomment section of the video we'll be\nhappy
