  "text": "umap takes a big pile of data that you\ncan't graph and helps you graph it\nhooray stat Quest hello I'm Josh starmer\nand welcome to stat Quest today we're\ngoing to talk about umap Dimension\nreduction main\nideas this stack Quest is sponsored by\nlightning and\ngrid. with lightning you can design\nbuild and scale models with ease focus\non the business and research problems\nthat matter to you lightning takes care\nof everything else and with grid you can\nuse the cloud to seamlessly train\nhundreds of models from your laptop with\na single command no code changes\nnecessary for more details follow the\nlinks in the pinned comment\nbelow note this stat Quest focuses on\nthe main ideas of how umap Works however\nif you're also interested in the map\nmathematical details be sure to check\nout the follow-up Quest umap\nmathematical\ndetails now imagine we collected weight\nand height measurements from a bunch of\npeople and we plotted the people on a\ntwo-dimensional graph like this where we\nhave weight on the x-axis the First\nDimension and height on the Y AIS the\nsecond\ndimension seeing the data can be useful\nto identify outlin buers and to identify\nclusters of similar people so looking at\ndata can be very useful and generally\nspeaking is one of the first steps in\nany data\nanalysis however if we wanted to include\neach person's age we would have to add a\nthird AIS and now our graph is\nthree-dimensional drawing a 3dimensional\ngraph on a two-dimensional computer\nscreen is awkward but\npossible however if we wanted to include\na lot more features we'd need to draw a\nfour or more dimensional graph and\nthat's not possible so what do we do if\nwe have a lot of features and we want to\nlook at the data well one good option is\nprincipal component analysis\nPCA and if you're not already familiar\nwith PCA you definitely should be so\ncheck out the quest anyway the problem\nwith PCA is that it only works well when\nthe first two principal components\naccount for most of the variation in the\ndata simply put if you have a really\ncomplicated data set PCA may not work\nvery\nwell so if we can't use PCA what should\nwe do one option is called umap uniform\nmanifold approximation and\nprojection umap takes high-dimensional\ndata meaning data with three or more\nfeatures and outputs a low-dimensional\ngraph meaning a graph we can easily look\nat umap is popular because it is\nrelatively fast even with large data\nsets and similar samples tend to Cluster\ntogether in the final output so it is\nuseful for identifying similarities and\noutliers bam so we can see what umap\ndoes and how it works we're going to\nstart with a very simple two-dimensional\ngraph and show how umap converts it to a\none-dimensional number line in other\nwords this two-dimensional graph will\nrepresent the high dimensional data that\nwe reduce with um map to a single\nDimension that will be the low\ndimensional\ngraph if we look at the high-dimensional\ndata we see that points a B and C are\nrelatively close to each other and form\na cluster and points d e and f are\nrelatively close to each other and form\nanother cluster\nand both clusters are relatively far\nfrom each other the goal of umap is to\ncreate a low-dimensional graph of this\ndata that preserves these\nhigh-dimensional clusters and their\nrelationship to each other the general\nidea is to initialize the\nlow-dimensional points and then move the\nlow dimensional points around until they\nform clusters that have the same\nrelationships we saw in the\nhigh-dimensional\ndata in other words because points a B\nand C are clustered together and are\nrelatively far from the other cluster\numap wants the low dimensional points a\nb and c to be close to each other and\nrelatively far from the other\ncluster so let's talk about the main\nideas of how umap makes this happen note\nif umap simply projected all of the data\nonto the\nxaxis then instead of two distinct\nclusters we'd see a mish mash of points\nand if we had a slightly more complex\ndata set with a third cluster here then\nprojecting the data onto the Y AIS\nwouldn't be any\nbetter so what umap does is calculates\nsimilarity scores to help identify\nclustered points so it can try to\npreserve that clustering in the\nlow-dimensional\ngraph the first thing that you map does\nis calculate the distances between each\npair of high-dimensional points\nnote I'm only showing two of the\ndistances between the two clusters but\njust know that we calculated all of them\nand that the Clusters are way far\napart now to calculate the similarity\nscores associated with point a we start\nby putting point a on a\ngraph now because point a is 0.5 units\naway from point B we put B 0.5 units\naway from a on the graph and because\npoint a is 2.4 units away from C we put\nC 2.4 units away from a on the graph and\nbecause the remaining points d e and f\nare all way far away from a we put them\nway far away from a on the\ngraph now we draw a curve over the data\nto calculate the similarity scores the\nshape of this curve depends on the\nnumber of high-dimensional neighbors\nthat you want each point to have a\ncommon default value for the number of\nhigh dimensional neighbors is 15 but in\nthis example where we have a tiny data\nset and we know each cluster has three\npoints we'll set it to three note to be\nclear the number of neighbors we want\neach point to have includes the point\nitself so by setting the number of\nneighbors to three we actually only want\ntwo other points as neighbors also later\nin the quest we'll talk about what\nhappens when we change the number of\nneighbors we want each point to have but\nfor now let's just set the value to\nthree now brace yourselves things are\nabout to get a little mathy the purpose\nof this math is to get an understanding\nof how the number of nearest neighbors\nparameter which is arguably the most\nimportant umap parameter you can adjust\nworks so that said umap takes the the\nlog base 2 of the number of high\ndimensional neighbors you want each\npoint to have and since we set the\nnumber of high dimensional neighbors to\nthree we get the log base 2 of 3 which\nequals\n1.6 and this value 1.6 is what defines\nthe shape of this curve the curve is\nshaped in such a way that the Y AIS\ncoordinates for the nearest Neighbors\nwhich in this case are points B and C\nadd up to the log base 2 of the number\nof nearest neighbors you specified which\nin this case is\n1.6 in other words this curve is shaped\nthe way it is so that the y- AIS\ncoordinate for B is 1.0 and the y-axis\ncoordinate for C is\n0.6 and the y- AIS coordinates for d e\nand f are all pretty much zero adding\nthese scores together gives us 1.6 the\ntarget number we are shooting for thus\nplus the y-axis coordinates for points B\nand C are their similarity scores\nrelative to a and since the scores for d\ne and f are all zero we can ignore them\nfor\nnow so let's save the similarity scores\nfor B and C\nbam now just like we did for point a\nlet's calculate the similarity scores\nrelative to point B first we put point B\non a graph and then then we add all the\nother data at their respective\ndistances and then we draw a curve over\nthe data so that the sum of the\nsimilarity scores the y-axis coordinates\nfor each point other than b equals\n1.6 anyway just like before because\npoints d e and f are way far away their\nscores are zero and we can ignore them\nso we only need to save scores for a and\nC relative to\nB likewise we calculate and save the\nnonzero scores for Point C bam note you\nmay have noticed that the similarity\nscore for C relative to B\n0.6 is different from the similarity\nscore for B relative to C\n1.0 the difference comes from the fact\nthat the curves for each point are\ndifferent umap scales the curve so that\nregardless of how close or far the\nneighboring points are are the sum of\nthe similarity scores will be equal to\nthe log base 2 of the number of nearest\nneighbors that you specify and scaling\nthe curves ensures that every point is\nsimilar to at least one other point in\nthe data\nset however using different curves mean\nthe similarity scores are not\nsymmetrical so umap makes them\nsymmetrical using a method similar to\ntaking the average and this is one of\nthose details we'll discuss in the\nfollow-up stack Quest bam note in the\nexact same way umap calculates the\nsimilarity scores for points d e and\nf\nbam now umap initializes a\nlow-dimensional\ngraph but as we can see this\nlow-dimensional graph is not ideal\nbecause point B needs to be closer to a\nbecause they are in the same\nhigh-dimensional cluster and point B\nneeds to be further from F because they\nare in two different high-dimensional\nclusters so to make this low-dimensional\ngraph show the same clusters we see in\nthe high-dimensional data umap picks two\nlow-dimensional points that it should\nmove closer together umap does this by\nrandomly selecting a pair of points in a\ncluster proportionally to their\nhigh-dimensional score in this case that\nmeans there is a higher probability that\numap might randomly select points a and\nB because their score is\n1.0 and there is a lower probability\nthat umap might randomly select points A\nand C because their score is\n0.8 so for this example let's assume\nthat umap randomly selected points A and\nB and that means umap wants to move\npoints A and B closer together then umap\nflips a coin and decides to move point B\ncloser to a note it could have just as\neasily decided to move point a closer to\nB now that we know that we will move\npoint B closer to a umap picks a point\nthat b should move further from so umap\nrandomly picks one of the points that\nare not in B's High dimensional cluster\nhowever unlike before this time the high\ndimensional scores do not influence\nwhich point is picked instead each point\nin a different cluster regardless of its\nscore has an equal chance of being\npicked so let's imagine umap picked\nPoint\ne now that umap has decided to move\npoint B closer to a because they should\nbe clustered together and move point B\nfurther from E because they should be in\ndifferent clusters umap has to figure\nout how much it should move point\nB to do this umap calculates low\ndimensional similarity scores Y axis\ncoordinates on a curve for points b and\na and for b and\ne however now instead of using a variety\nof Curves like we did for the high\ndimensional data the low dimensional\nsimilarity scores come from a fixed\nbell-shaped curve that is derived from a\nt\ndistribution note generally speaking a t\ndistribution curve is like a gussian\ncurve or normal distribution\nexcept the T distribution tends to be\nshorter and have fatter\nTails also note the low dimensional\ncurves are all the same\nsize now because points A and B are in\nthe same cluster or neighborhood umap\nwants to move point B closer to a in\norder to maximize this low-dimensional\nscore in contrast because points B and E\nare in different clusters\numap wants to move point B further from\nE so that it can minimize this low\ndimensional\nscore so ultimately umap moves point B a\nlittle closer to a and a little further\nfrom\ne note umap only moved point B a small\namount because when there is a ton of\ndata taking small steps each turn makes\nit easier to get the low-dimensional\ngraph looking Just Right double\nbam now umap picks another pair of\npoints to move together in this case\numap wants to move D closer to\ne then um map randomly picks a point in\nthe other cluster to move D away\nfrom in this case umap decides to move D\naway from\nC now umap calculates low dimensional\nsimilarity scores to decide how to move\nPoint d\nnote if we move D closer to e the point\nwe want to get closer to then we will\nalso be moving D closer to C the point\nwe want to get further\nfrom however this move barely increases\nthe score for D relative to\nC in other words the score we want to\nminimize will still be pretty small in\ncontrast the score we want to maximize\nthe score relative to e will get much\nlarger\nthus umap moves d a little closer to\ne likewise umap moves the points one\nstep at a time until we have two\nlow-dimensional clusters that are\nrelatively far from each other just like\nwe see in the high dimensional data\ntriple\nbam note if you're familiar with how tne\nworks you may have noticed that umap is\nvery very similar\nin terms of the main ideas of how umap\nand tne work they are essentially the\nsame and most of the differences are\nvery subtle however there are two big\nimportant\ndifferences the first difference is that\ntne always starts with a random\ninitialization of the low-dimensional\ngraph in other words tne might start out\nwith the low dimensional data looking\nlike this and then the next time you run\nt- snake on the exact same data set it\nmight start out with a low dimensional\ndata looking like this and every time\nyou run tne on the same data set you\nstart with a different low-dimensional\ngraph of the\ndata in contrast umap uses something\ncalled spectral embedding to initialize\nthe low-dimensional graph and what that\nmeans is that every time you use UAP on\na specific data set you always start\nwith the exact same low dimensional\ngraph\nbam the other difference is that tne\nmoves every single point a little bit\neach\niteration in contrast umap can move just\none point or a small subset of points\neach time and this helps it scale well\nwith super big data sets\nbam lastly way back when we calculated\nsimilarity scores for the high\ndimensional data we said that the shape\nof each curve was determined in part by\nthe userdefined parameter the number of\nneighbors each point has now let's talk\nabout what happens when we change the\nnumber of\nneighbors generally speaking when you\nhave a lot of data a relatively low\nvalue for the number of neighbors\nresults in small independent\nclusters in some ways this is sort of\nlike seeing the details but not the big\npicture in contrast a relatively large\nvalue for the number of neighbors gives\nyou more of the big picture and less of\nthe details so it can be worth trying\ndifferent values to see what works best\nwith your own data\nbam now it's time for some Shameless\nself-promotion if you want to
