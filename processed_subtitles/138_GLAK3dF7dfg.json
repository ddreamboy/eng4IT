  "text": "in this video we're gonna look at what\ndata mining is and we're gonna introduce\nsome fundamental concepts we need to\nunderstand how it works\ninformally you can think of data mining\nas the process of using a computer\nprogram an algorithm to find patterns or\nrelationships in your data for example\nyou might want to be looking for what\ncombinations of symptoms will allow you\nto reliably diagnose a patient another\nexample of data mining if you are\nsomeone who is running a store you might\nwant to know what types of products\ncustomers tend to purchase together at\nthe heart of the data mining process is\nsome type of machine learning in which\nwe apply an algorithm it learns\nsomething about the data and these are\ncalled machine learning algorithms\nultimately we're going to look at three\ndifferent types of machine learning in\nthis class but for now we're primarily\ngoing to focus on classification\nlearning so in classification learning\nwe're trying to figure out how to\nclassify objects or entities on the\nbasis of their characteristics so maybe\nyou know a bunch of information about a\ncustomer of your store or potential\ncustomer and you're wondering whether\nthat customer is likely to buy a\ncomputer in the course of the next year\nyou just want to be able to have a\npretty good idea yes they are going to\nbuy it no they are not going to buy it\nand so what you need to do in order to\nperform classification learning is you\nneed to have what is called training\ndata a set of training examples where\neach example is a single customer in\nthis case and we have a bunch of\ninformation about the customer we have\nthe customers ID agender the age whether\nthe customer is a student what the\ncustomers credit rating is good fair\nexcellent\nand then this is the important part we\nalready have classified each of these\nexamples we already know whether the\ncustomer bought a computer or not\nand the idea then is that the algorithm\nis going to take this training data and\nproduce a model of some type that we can\nthen use to classify new examples to\npredict in this case whether a new\ncustomer will buy a computer in the next\nyear one possible model you could learn\nfrom these training examples and by the\nway I've only shown you five customers\nyou want as much training data as you\npossibly can get but one possible model\nthat might be produced is what is known\nas a decision tree and this is based on\nour training data the actual process of\nfinding the tree determining the treaty\nis something we're going to get into\nlater but once we have learned the model\nfrom the training data we're then able\nto use it to classify new examples so\nhere I have two new customers I know the\nsame information about them as before\nexcept I do not yet have a\nclassification for them I don't know\nwhether they're going to buy a computer\nand that's what I want to be able to\npredict so to apply my decision tree I'm\ngoing to start at the top and work my\nway down so if we focus first on the\nfirst customer ID 333 you can see we're\nbeing told to look first at her age and\nyou can see that she's 68 and as a\nresult we're going to go down the branch\nthat is labeled greater than 65 because\nher age is greater than 65 we go down\nthat branch that brings us to the next\nthing that we should look at which is\nher credit rating and because her credit\nrating is fair we're going to go down\nthat branch and that brings us to a box\nwith a classification and in this case\nthat box tells us that no we should not\nexpect her to buy a computer that's our\nprediction for that customer let's go to\nour next customer we again start at the\ntop this customer's age is 23 so we go\ndown this branch which is the less than\n35 branch by the way notice there's a\nmiddle branch here for customers whose\nages are between 35 and 65 but in this\ncase we're going down this branch\nthat then tells us to look next at\nwhether the customer is a student and in\nthis case the customer is a student so\nwe go down the yes branch and that\nbrings us to our classification for that\ncustomer which is yes we predict that he\nwill buy a computer in the next year now\nwhen we're talking about our training\ndata every row is referred to as an\nexample or an instance every column is\nreferred to as an attribute and we can\ndivide up those attributes into two\ntypes the output attribute is the one\nthat we're trying to be able to predict\nthat's our classification column\neverything else is an input attribute\nthe model that we learn takes the values\nof the input attributes and gives us a\nvalue for the output attribute in the\ncase of our decision tree it took the\nvalues of the age student and credit\nrating columns and it gave us a\nprediction for whether the user would\nbuy a computer my computer was our\noutput now another way to distinguish\nbetween the attributes is on whether\nthey are nominal or numeric nominal\nattributes have values that are\nessentially names of categories in this\ncase most of the attributes are nominal\ngender student credit rating and buying\ncomputer numeric attributes as you might\nexpect have values that are numbers but\nwhat's especially important here is it\nhas to make sense to compare those\nnumbers using greater than and less net\nso for example in our model we were\nbasing our predictions in part on things\nlike was the age less than 35 and that\nkind of comparison makes sense because\nit does make sense to say whether\nsomeone is less than 35 and that might\nhave an impact on your predictions but\nfor something like ID even though the\nvalues are numbers that's not truly\nnumeric because it wouldn't make sense\nto base your prediction on something\nlike whether the ID was less than 300 it\ndoesn't give us useful information about\nthe person in order for us to apply\nclassification\nlearning we have to have a single output\nattribute whose value we're trying to\ndetermine so in our case we did and then\nthe other thing that made this\nclassification learning is that that\nsingle output attribute is nominal for\nclassification learning that has to be\nthe case the thing you're trying to\npredict has to be a nominal attribute\nand the input attributes can be either\nnominal or numeric there's no\nrestriction there now let's imagine we\nchange the problem so instead of\npredicting yes or no we're trying to\npredict a probability that the computer\nwill be bought by the customer in the\nnext year well now our output attribute\nis numeric and therefore it can't be\nclassification learning anymore instead\nit's now numeric estimation and this has\na completely different set of algorithms\nand it produces different types of\nmodels and we'll talk more about this\nlater on it's worth noting that here\nagain the input attributes can be either\nnominal or numeric what matters is that\nthe output attribute is numeric and if\nit is you have to do in America\nestimation instead of classification\nlearning\n",
