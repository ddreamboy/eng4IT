  "text": "[Music]\nin this video we'll be discussing the\nconcept of semi-supervised learning\nsemi-supervised learning kind of takes a\nmiddle ground between supervised\nlearning and unsupervised learning as a\nquick refresher recall from previous\nvideos that supervised learning is the\nlearning that occurs during training of\nan artificial neural network when the\ndata in our training set is labeled\nunsupervised learning on the other hand\nis the learning that occurs when the\ndata in our training set is not labeled\nso now onto semi-supervised learning\nsemi-supervised learning uses a\ncombination of supervised and\nunsupervised learning techniques and\nthat's because in a scenario where we'd\nmake use of semi-supervised learning\nwe'd have a combination of both labeled\nand unlabeled data let's expand on this\nidea with an example say we have access\nto a large unlabeled data set that we'd\nlike to train a model on and that\nmanually labeling all of the state\nourselves is just not practical well we\ncould go through and manually label some\nportion of this large data set ourselves\nand use that portion to train our model\nand this is fine in fact this is how a\nlot of data use for neural networks\nbecomes labeled but you know if we have\naccess to large amounts of data and\nwe've only labeled some small portion of\nthe data then what a waste it would be\nto just leave all the other unlabeled\ndata on the table I mean after all we\nknow the more data we have to train a\nmodel on the better and more robust our\nmodel will be so what can we do to make\nuse of the remaining unlabeled data in\nour data set well one thing we can do is\nimplement a technique that falls under\nthe category of semi-supervised learning\ncalled pseudo labeling this is how\npseudo labeling works so as just\nmentioned we've already labeled some\nportion of our data set now we're going\nto use this label data as the training\nset for our model we're then going to\ntrain our model just as we would with\nany other labelled data set okay and\nthen just through the regular training\nprocess we get our model performing\npretty well so everything we've done up\nto this point has been just regular old\nsupervised learning in practice now\nhere's where the unsupervised learning\npiece comes into play after we've\ntrained our model on the labeled portion\nof the data set\nwe then use our model to predict on the\nremaining unlabeled portion of data we\nthen take these predictions and label\neach piece of unlabeled data with the\nindividual outputs that were predicted\nfor them this process of labeling the\nunlabeled data with the output that was\npredicted by our neural network is the\nvery essence of pseudo labeling now\nafter labeling the unlabeled data\nthrough this pseudo labeling process we\nthen train our model on the full data\nset which is now comprised of both the\ndata that was actually truly labeled\nalong with the data that was pseudo\nlabeled through the use of pseudo\nlabeling were able to train on a vastly\nlarger data set we're also able to train\non data that otherwise may have\npotentially taken many tedious hours of\nhuman labor to manually label the data\nas you can imagine sometimes the cost of\nacquiring or generating a fully label\ndata set is just too high or the pure\nact of generating all the labels itself\nis just not feasible so through this\nprocess we can see how this approach\nmakes use of both supervised learning\nwith the labeled data and unsupervised\nlearning with the unlabeled data which\ntogether give us the practice of\nsemi-supervised learning so hopefully\nnow you have an understanding of what\nsemi-supervised learning is and how you\nmay apply it and practice through the\nuse of pseudo labeling and I hope you\nfound this video helpful if you did\nplease like the video subscribe suggest\nand comment and thanks for watching\n[Music]\n",
