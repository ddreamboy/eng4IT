  "text": "yes I just passed the ISC squ CC which\nstands for certified in cyber security\ndear Caleb congratulations we're pleased\nto inform you that you have passed the\ncertified and cyber security examination\nby passing this examination you've\ncompleted the first of three steps\ntoward earning the certification and\nbecoming an ISC Square member so in this\nvideo I'm going to be telling you guys\nhow exactly I passed the ISC Square CC\nhow I studied for the exam different\ntips on how I pass the exam and my\noverall experience taking this exam\nremember I'll be putting study materials\nin this video that you can go away and\nuse to pass the exam as well the same\nway I did please enjoy this\nvideo what's up guys my name is Caleb\nOni certified and this is another video\non an exam which I've recently passed so\nlet's talk a little bit about the exam\nso certified in cyber security is a\nfound foundational exam which covers the\nfoundations and the basics of cyber\nsecurity the exam is 100 multiple choice\nquestions and you have to complete this\nexam within 2 hours which I think is a\nreasonable amount of time for 100\nmultiple choice questions you're not\ngoing to need the full two hours I took\nthis exam just this morning and one of\nthe things I noticed immediately is that\nonce you do a question you can't go back\nand review questions and you can't flag\nthem and review them at the end you just\ngo through one question and go on to the\nnext to the next there's no going back\nso make sure you pick the answer you\nreally think is correct cuz you're not\ngoing back to it you do have enough time\nto think and to process is this the\nright answer that I want to pick and use\nthat time wisely so for me this exam had\nto be taken at a test center I didn't\nget the option to take it from home and\nof course the pass Mark is a 700 over\n1000 like a lot of certifications are if\nyou're going to take the IC Square CC\nand you've been studying for this exam\nwith the online training it's worth\nnoting that the questions in the online\ntraining are a little bit easier than\nthe ones on the actual exam and the exam\nis a little bit more difficult not to\nworry because I'll be mentioning some\nresources in this video that you could\nuse to find some resources which have\nsome questions that are a lot closer to\nthe ones in the actual exam so let's\ntalk about how I studied for this exam\nand what resources I used I took this\nexam because I'm working in the role of\na cloud security engineer and I'm coming\nfrom more of a cloud infrastructure role\nso there's a lot that I need to learn\nand improve on when it comes to cyber\nsecurity so it was definitely a good\nidea for me to go and take a\nfoundational cyber security exam and\nstudy for it and understand a bit more\nabout different cyber security terms and\nterminology and stuff like that it took\nme about 3 to 4 weeks to study for this\nexam but I definitely could have studied\nin one or two just because I've been\nworking in Tech for about almost 2 years\nthe reason it took me 3 to 4 weeks was\nmore because I was studying and working\nat the same time and I was trying to\nfind time here and there to study\nstudying working doing YouTube uh\nplaying basketball doing life there's a\nlot of things and it was kind of hard to\nfind the time to study time management\nwasn't the best there were only two\nresources which I needed to pass this\nexam and I'll be mentioning them now\nremember that I'm going to be putting\nlinks to these resources in the\ndescription deson of this video so if\nyou want to use them check them out and\nthe first one of course is the ISC\nSquare training the free online training\nfor the IC squ CC should give you\neverything you need to pass however it\nwould be really helpful to use other\nresources as well the online training is\nreally good it's really in-depth I think\nfor me sometimes it was too in-depth\nsometimes it goes so deep that you're\nnot sure if what you're reading is going\nto come out in the exam or it's worth\neven knowing\nI'm more of a video person and I'm good\nwith video courses personally and\nbecause the ISC Square training had a\nlot of written\ninformation and video it was kind of\nhard to balance the two I was confused I\nwas like do I need to watch all of this\nvideo do I need to read all of this\nwritten information and so a lot of the\ntime I was skimming through the written\ninformation and then watching the video\nand I knew that I would need some more\nresources to pass this exam I looked\nonline and on Reddit I saw someone say\nthat the actual exam is a lot harder\nthan the questions in the training and I\nbelieve them and went after looking for\nsome more questions which would be\nsimilar to the exam and in doing so I\ncame across my second resource which was\na YouTube channel called prob naer and\nprob naer has several questions on the\nISC squ exam and these practice\nquestions were really good he doesn't\njust go through the questions and\nanswers but he also explains each and\nevery question which was really really\nhelpful for me when I took the exam\nbecause it wasn't just the questions\nthat were going through that were going\nto come out in the exam but it was the\nteaching that he gave and the\nexplanations that helped me to\nunderstand these questions and so I'm\ngoing to be linking his YouTube channel\nhere he is really good and he goes\nthrough the explanations really well so\ndefinitely check that out cuz not only\ndid these videos give me a feel for the\nexam they also gave gave me explanations\non different questions and different\nthings that would come out and those\nwere the only two resources I needed to\npass this exam I've been working in\ncyber security for about 10 months and\nmaybe if you haven't been working in\ncyber security as long you might need\nmore resources but for me this was\nenough and I think for most people this\nwould be enough even for some people who\nhaven't even worked in cyber security\nthat long that may be enough for you as\nwell it all depends on the person I'm\nreally grateful to have passed this exam\nand the next step is to claim the\ncertification and become an ISC squared\nmember and to do this you have to pay\nthe $50 to become a member and\nofficially get the certification\nrewarded if you've passed this exam or\nare preparing for this exam please tell\nus about your experience studying and\nhow it's going for you or how it's gone\nfor you in the comments section thank\nyou so much for watching this video I\nhope it's been helpful for those who are\ntrying to take this exam or those who\nhave taken it already and I will see you\nguys in the next video subscribe to the\nchannel follow me on LinkedIn and\nInstagram and I'll see you\n[Music]\nlater\n",
