  "text": "i'm going to explain the concept of\ntransform learning in the context of\ncomputer vision quickly and precisely\nnow the reason we're doing transfer\nlearning is so that we can learn some\nfunction f which is going to be a\nconvolutional neural network\nwhich takes in a picture and it's going\nto output\nthe class of that picture okay so we\nhave\na no number of classes where it's say\nthree maybe for our problem\nwe're trying to learn how to map a\npicture as\ninput into the output of either apple\nbanana or cucumber\nokay so we have three classes\nand we are trying to given whatever\npicture it is maybe it has\nmaybe a picture look something like this\nwhere it has an apple\nin the top right and we want that to be\ncategorized\nso f of that thing this is the same as\nabove just in picture form\nf of that is say one okay and because\nthis is corresponding to apple\nbanana and cucumber whatever it is it's\njust a\na distinguishing thing this is that\nimage\nokay this is that class of that image\nnow we could do this by\nmaking our own convolutional neural\nnetwork by scratch or copying an\narchitecture of an existing one\nbut the easiest thing to do is to copy\nthe architecture of an existing one\nand use almost all of its parameters\nthat it's already learned\non a different task but transfer it to\nyour task so it's transfer learning\nbecause we are learning how to transfer\nthis knowledge from the other neural\nnetwork into yours\nokay we're transferring the learning\nthat hap that it had\ninto our own learning for our problem so\nhow can we do that well we need some\nneural network\nthat is already existent and trained so\nwe'll call it vgg\nthis is a no neural network and say that\nit was trained\nand it has been it's this is existing it\nis trained\non imagenet which is a huge repository\nof images\nthat is similar to your problem but not\nexactly the same\nso maybe it's actually going to be more\ncomplex than your problem because\nthis neural network its job is to it can\nlearn a vast number of pictures\nso maybe vgg was already trained on\ntaking an image same as yours same type\nof image except now what it can do\nis output say a thousand different\nclasses\nso maybe it knows actually how to do\na monkey so maybe i can transfer it\nmaybe it can take an\nimage and recognize if it's a monkey or\nwhether it's a zebra\nor all the way up until a thousand\nthings say that it's\na thousand classes and say this last one\nis just\nan ape is what came to mind from reading\nthe monkey okay\nso say that this is existent already and\nit is\nthat vgg has learned how to do this now\nwhen we say trained on imagenet\nwe mean it has learned a ton\nof parameters okay it has learned\na ton of parameters on how to do this\nwell it has seen the training set\npeople have done it with the validation\nset and how to\naccurately get a good score on a test\nset of information by learning\nparameters\nknowing how to generalize the pattern\nbetween a picture and what\nthat class is for its specific output so\nit's able to do this but what's\nfascinating is that we were able to\ntransfer almost all of these trained\nlearned parameters\nand the model architecture and what i\nmean architecture i mean\nso vgg is something like this where it\ntakes in an image\nand then we'll just say that it looks\nlike this where we have a bunch of\nconvolutional layers yes people often\ndraw a convolutional layer\nlike this because it's a 3d thing but it\ndoesn't really matter\nthe point is that we do a bunch of stuff\nin the middle and maybe there's pooling\nmaybe there is batch normalization at\nsome point we're going to make it look\nlike a feed forward neural network\nand wherever there is parameters to be\nlearned here and there is millions of\nthem\nwe can actually borrow all of those\nexcept\nthat last layer now that last layer is\ngoing to be a thousand\ndimensional because its job is to do a\nthousand classes where this one\nis the probability of the picture being\na monkey\nand this one is the probability of it\nbeing a zebra\nand the last one would be the\nprobability of being an ape and whatever\neverything in the middle\nit's going to sum to 1 because it's some\nprobability distribution\nnow the only thing that's wrong is this\nlast thing\nwe're happy with this existent model\narchitecture because\nthis is all for learning pictures it's\nfascinating that\nthe only thing we have to change is this\nnext thing over here\nso let me just zoom in on this again i'm\ngoing to make a big\nbig scene of this because this is the\nimportant part of transforming\nsay that we have this image i'm just\ndrawing the same things before\nthis is in a neural network called vgg\nand it doesn't really matter what neural\nnetwork it is\nwe take an image and so it's going to do\na bunch of stuff in the middle\nand it's going to be feed forward neural\nnetwork just normal dense layers\nand then it's going to have say it a\nthousand things\nokay so this is a thousand wide\nexcept what we do in transfer learning\nis we keep\nall of these parameters we so-called\nfreeze them\nokay if i write freeze that's meaning\ndo not train these neural network layers\nwe still are going to use them in a\ncalculation\nbut the point of training is to learn\nparameters we are not going to touch\nthose parameters it's the same thing as\nlike linear regression\nwhere in linear regression you learn how\nto\nfit the beta 1 that's the slope and the\nbeta naught so the beta 1 is\nthe the beta 1 is this slope and the\nbeta naught is this lift\nhere okay so how high we lift it it's\nthe same thing here we are learning all\nof these parameters\nwe freeze all of these parameters and\nwhat we do\nis we chop this off so i'm just going to\nerase this\nwe i'm going to erase that a little\nbigger okay\nso instead the very last layer or its\njob is to get\na thousand different classes we want\nthat\nto be for our problem and for ours in\nthis example\nit's gonna be different for your example\nbut we wanted to learn\nthree different things for apple banana\nor cucumber so that this is probability\nof apple\nthis is probability of banana\nwriting that for short and probability\nof cucumber writing that for short as\nwell\nall we have to do is learn the\nparameters that are involved\nin this middle piece here keeping\neverything else the same\nand then this is probably not guaranteed\nbut will probably do\nvery well on the task of recognizing\napples\nbananas and cucumbers thank you for\nwatching\n[Music]\n[Music]\nyou\n",
