  "text": "yo what's up YouTube Welcome Back to the\nchannel today's video I'm going to give\nyou guys a breakdown of exactly what I\nwould do if I had to restart my cyber\nsecurity career from scratch in 2024 now\nthis is a common question that I get to\nask a lot of times especially for those\npeople who are looking to break into the\nindustry so with that being said guys if\nyou're new to the channel my name is Ben\nand I make videos about cyber security\nand my career and my journey and my\nexperiences throughout my time in cyber\nsecurity so if you guys are new to the\nchannel make sure to drop me a like for\nthe YouTube algorithm And subscribe to\nthe channel if you haven't already I'd\nlove to have you guys join the family\nwe're on our way to 50,000 subscribers\nalso if you guys want more short form\ncontent and lifestyle content be sure to\nfollow me on Instagram and Tik Tok at\ncyberith Ben with that being said though\nguys let's go ahead and get right into\nthe\nvideo so I just finished my first year\nworking in cyber security full-time and\nit kind of had me thinking what I would\ndo if I had to restart my cyber security\ncareer from scratch so thinking about\nthis sort of road mapap that I'm about\nto explain to you I'm going to be having\nno experience what's ever and no\nbackground in cyber security so with\nthat said the first thing that I would\nstart off with is going to be getting my\ncertification using the Google cyber\nsecurity professional certificate the\nreason why I say that is because first\nof all it's going to be extremely\naffordable you pay on a monthly basis I\nbelieve it's $49 per month and you only\npay for how much you use the\ncertification and the course for so for\nexample if you finish it in one month\nyou're only going to pay $49 so it's\nextremely affordable and the payment\nplan is flexible on top of that you\ndon't need to have any prior experience\nwhen it comes to it or cyber security to\nget started so that's going to be a\ngreat way for me to get my foot in the\ndoor and start learning the foundations\nof cyber security the Google cyber\nsecurity certificate itself is comprised\nof eight different courses that go over\neight different concepts in cyber\nsecurity and they give you a really good\nrundown of exactly how those things work\nand it's taught by Google professionals\nit goes over things like network\nsecurity using Linux and SQL and also\nautomating different tasks with python\nwhich is overall some really important\nskills to have when going into cyber\nsecurity and it's really going to help\nyou be able to make an impact from the\nbeginning on day one of your first cyber\nsecurity job and I believe once you\ncomplete this certificate you also get a\ndiscount code that you can use on the\nSecurity Plus exam so if you guys want\nto check out this certificate I'll leave\na link in the description\nbelow so the next thing that I would do\nafter getting my Google cyber security\nprofessional certificates is that I'd\nstart looking into getting the Security\nPlus certification the Security Plus\ncertification is going to be one of the\nmost popular entry-level cyber security\ncertificates on the market right now and\nit's recognized widely throughout the\ncyber security industry a lot of\nemployers for entry-level cyber security\njobs are going to expect you to have the\nSecurity Plus certification on your\nresume when you are applying so it\ncovers a wide range but doesn't really\ngo in depth but that's the reason why\nit's going to be an entry level cyber\nsecurity certificates and we'll talk\nabout a little bit later on in the video\nabout branching into those more advanced\nlevel certifications I'm going to leave\na link in the description below that has\nthe Security Plus exam objectiv so feel\nfree to check that out and also if\nyou're interested to learn more exactly\nhow I was able to pass the Security Plus\nexam in 9 days feel free to check out\nthe video that I'll leave in the\ndescription below as well so after\ngetting the Security Plus certification\nfrom CompTIA I'll next look into the\nnetwork plus certification also from\nCompTIA a lot of times people prefer\ngetting the network plus before getting\nthe Security Plus certification but it's\ngoing to be up to your own personal\npreference in my opinion I don't think\nit makes a huge difference so the reason\nwhy I mentioned the network plus\ncertification is because in cyber\nsecurity it involves so many different\naspects and it's going to help a lot\nwhen it comes to your networking\nknowledge as someone working in cyber\nsecurity you're going to have to have a\nbasic understanding a foundational\nunderstanding of networking Concepts and\nunderstanding how different computers\nwork and communicate with each other how\ndata flows and things of that nature so\ngetting a good understanding of\nnetworking fundamentals from the network\nplus certification is going to give you\na huge boost when it comes to your first\nentry level job in cyber security so\nafter those three certifications I'd\nlook to get an entry-level Cloud\ncertification so for me personally I\nwould lean more into the a Cloud\npartition or certification just because\nmore companies are using AWS\ninfrastructure feel free to check out my\nvideo where I talk about entry-level\nCloud certifications I'll leave a link\nin the description below as well so your\nmain choices when it comes to these\ncertifications is going to be the AWS\nCloud petitioner certification or the as\n900 from Microsoft both of these entry\nlevel certifications are going to teach\nyou the basics and the foundations of\ncloud computing so they're going to\nteach you exactly how cloud computing\nworks the different services from each\nof these vendors and things of that sort\nand because so many companies that\nemployers nowadays have some form of\ncloud computing and Cloud infrastructure\nin place having this on your resume is\ngoing to be so influential and impactful\nwhen it comes to finding your first job\nin cyber security if you guys want to\nlearn exactly how I was able to pass the\nAWS Cloud practitioner exam in 7 days\nI'll also link that in the description\nbelow so after getting these four\ncertifications I would look to start\ndeveloping my own personal projects and\nmy own personal portfolio and start\ndeveloping my resume to start applying\nfor entry-level jobs and also\ninternships I made an Instagram real and\nalso a YouTube short talking about some\nideas for cyber security projects for\nbeginners so make sure you guys check\nthat out I'll also leave that in the\ndescription\nbelow so after developing some personal\nprojects and adding those to my resume\nand beginning to apply for internships\nin full-time jobs while I'm doing this\nI'll start to look into some more\nadvanced level certifications that align\ndirectly with what I want to do in cyber\nsecurity so for example if I'm someone\nwho wants to get a sock analist role so\nsomeone who works in the security\nOperation Center triaging log\nmaintaining alerts and things of that\nsort I will look into The Blue Team\nlevel one certification it's going to be\nan entry level certification for those\nlooking to get some aak experience and\nalso some Hands-On lab experience I\npassed this certification a few months\nago so feel free to check out that video\nas well another example would be if I'm\nlooking to get into the red team or\npenetration testing maybe I'd look into\nthe PJP offered by TCM security that is\nalso going to be the equivalent of a\nblue Team level one just the red team\nversion from a good company both of\nthese certifications are going to be\ngiving you a foundational understanding\nof Blue Team and Red Team respectively\nand it's going to give you a good\nfoundation of both of those aspects so\nthose are two examples of some more\nadvanced level certifications for\ndifferent aspects in cyber security but\nif you want to apply for a specific role\nor specific niche in cyber security make\nsure you guys look into some more\nadvanced level certifications and start\nstudying for those while you're applying\nfor full-time jobs and\ninternships so that is going to be it in\nterms of the road map for these\ndifferent certifications that I would\ntake to try and break into the industry\nagain from scratch but one thing I\nwanted to reiterate is that a lot of\ntimes certifications are great to have\nespecially for your resume but skills\nare going to be your main priority so as\nsomeone looking to break into the\nindustry certifications are going to be\na great way for you to make your resume\nlook better and look more attractive to\nemployers so these certifications are\ngoing to get you maybe an internship or\nmaybe your foot in the door but a lot of\ntimes you don't want to neglect just\ntrying to get certifications you also\nwant to prioritize really staying in the\nmoments when you're getting the\ncertifications really learning these\ndifferent foundational basic concepts in\ncyber security and don't just rush\nthrough them make sure you really\nunderstand what you're learning what\nyou're ingesting so don't get complacent\njust because you get an entry-level job\nmake sure you guys continue developing\nand continue building your skills\nbecause that's going to be extremely\ncrucial especially working in the cyber\nsecurity\nindustry with that being said guys that\nis going to be my piece of advice and\nalso my road map if I had to restart my\ncareer in 2024 if you guys found some\ninsight in this video please go ahead\nand drop me a like and also if you're\nnew to the channel and you're not\nsubscribed already and you're watching\nthis video what are you

lifestyle content feel\nfree to follow me on Instagram and Tik\nTok at cyberith Ben with that being said\nthough guys thank you so much for\nwatching this video and I'll catch you\nguys in the next
