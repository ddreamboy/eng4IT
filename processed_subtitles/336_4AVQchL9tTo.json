  "text": "this is not yet another Cloud comparison\nvideo I'm not just going to be giving\nyou a basic overview of each provider\ninstead we are going to be comparing\nAmazon web services AWS Microsoft Azure\nGoogle Cloud platform gcp on a number of\nkey factors and really dive in into the\ndetails so grab your coffee or your\nfavorite beverage sit back and let's get\nstarted my name is Elias I'm a Senior\nSolutions architect now let's do this\n[Music]\nfirst up on the list we have Amazon web\nservices also known as AWS this is the\noldest and the most established cloud\nprovider having been launched back in\n2006. AWS offers a wide range of\nservices including compute and storage\nand databases as well as machine\nlearning and Internet of Things\ncapabilities it's also the most popular\ncloud provider today with the largest\nmarket share next we have Microsoft\nAzure Azure was launched in in 2010 and\noffers several\nus including compute some storage and\ndatabases it also has a strong focus on\nhybrid Cloud capabilities allowing\ncustomers to easily connect on-premise\ninfrastructure with Azure Services Azure\nalso has a strong integration with other\nMicrosoft products such as Office 365\nand Dynamics 365. lastly we have Google\ncloud platform or TCP now gcp was\nlaunched in 2011 just one year after\nAzure and offers similar services to AWS\nand Azure including again compute\nstorage and databases and gcp has a\nstrong focus on big data and machine\nlearning with services like bigquery and\nsensorflow it also offers strong\nintegration with other Google products\nsuch as Google analytics and Google Maps\nfor example so let's start our\ncomparison with pricing AWS is known for\nhaving a vast array of products and\nservices to choose from but their\npricing structure can be a little\ncomplex and difficult to navigate Azure\non the other hand has a more\nstraightforward pricing model and often\noffers discounts for long-term\ncommitments which can make it a good\nchoice for businesses with predictable\nworkloads and gcp has a reputation for\nbeing the most cost effective of the\nthree especially for those who are\nwilling to do some optimizations to get\nthe best prices next let's take a look\nat the range of services offered AWS has\nthe most comprehensive offering of the\nthree with a huge number of products and\nservices that can be tailored to fit\nalmost any need Azure comes in second in\nthis regard with a solid selection of\nservices that are particularly well\nsuited for Enterprise customers and gcp\nis a bit more focused with a smaller\nrange of services that are geared more\ntowards developers and startups keep\nthat in mind we'll get back to it later\nin the video now I have heard folks\ncomplain about how the AWS web console\nis overwhelming it so that got me\nthinking about comparing the web\nconsoles next and it seems all three\nmajor Cloud providers offer\nuser-friendly interfaces and\nuncomprehensive documentation to help\nusers get started however\nin terms of web console ergonomics there\nare some differences between the three\nproviders First AWS offers a\ncomprehensive web console with a wide\nrange of services but I agree it can be\noverwhelming for beginners the console\nis highly customizable and allows users\nto create custom dashboards but it can\nalso take some time to navigate and find\nthe specific Services you need on the\nother hand azure's web console is\nconsidered to be more intuitive and easy\nto use compared to AWS with a more\nstreamlined interface and clear\nnavigation the console also offers a\nwide range of services but it's more\nfocused on Microsoft specific products\nand services now gcp's web console is\nconsidered to be the most user friendly\nof the three with a clean simple\ninterface that makes it easy for\nbeginners to find and use the services\nthey need the console offers also a wide\nrange of services but it's more focused\non big data and machine learning so it\nseems that overall all three Cloud\nproviders offer user-friendly web\nconsoles but Azure and gcp are\nconsidered to be more intuitive and more\nbeginner friendly or user friendly than\nAWS let's talk about internet of things\nnext as a subjects I'm very interested\nin personally as a tinkerer so I went on\nthe hunt trying to find which out of the\nmajor three Cloud providers is well\npositioned in the iot domain and we'll\nstart with AWS well it offers a\ncomprehensive set of iot services\nincluding AWS iot core Green Grass and\niot analytics these Services provide a\nwide range of capabilities for iot\ndeployment such as device management\ndata collection and processing machine\nlearning however the complexity of these\nServices can be overwhelming for a\nbeginner Azure iot on the other hand is\nconsidered to be more beginner friendly\ncompared to AWS with a more streamlined\ninterface and a focus on ease of use\nAzure iot Central is a fully managed SAS\nsolution that allows users to connect to\nMonitor and to manage iot devices\nwithout requiring any Cloud expertise\ngcp also offers a wide range of iot\nservices including iot core Cloud iot\nEdge and Cloud iot devices Decay but it\nseems gcp's iot services are focused on\ndata analytics on machine learning and\non edge Computing Google's iot Services\nis considered to be easy to use and\nbeginners friendly but not as\ncomprehensive not as complete as AWS or\nAzure by the way did you start to notice\na pattern here it seems that no matter\nwhat field we look at Azure is\nconsidered to be most beginner friendly\nAWS the most comprehensive set of\nservices while gcp is considered to be\neasy to use but with a focus on data\nanalytics and machine learning but I was\nnot convinced not yet so I set out to\nresearch yet another aspect their sdks\nthe software development kits and how\neasy it is for their customers to build\nand integrate applications with their\nrespective cloud services but that was\nalmost a waste of time because they\npretty much turn out to score the same\nall the three provide sdks that support\nvarious programming languages such as\nJava python.net node.js go Ruby and many\nmany more all the three provide a\nconvenience way to interact with their\nservices and all the three provide a CLI\na command line interface that allows\ndevelopers to access their respective\nservices using the command line commands\nso I quickly moved on to the next item\non my list which is databases I wanted\nto learn which one was offering the best\ndatabase Services allowing the customers\nto store to manage access their data in\nthe Cloud so here it goes AWS seems to\nhave thought about every single data\nstorage use case you can think of I've\ncreated a managed service for it this is\nvery obvious when you look at their\npurpose-built database web page whether\nit's relational key value in -memory\ndatabase white column\nalways find a fully managed database\nservice at AWS and Azure was actually\nnot very far behind offering similar\nServices as AWS such as Azure SQL\ndatabase a fully managed relational\ndatabase service Azure Cosmos DB a fully\nmanaged nosql database service and data\nLake storage a fully managed data like\nservice obviously now Azure also offers\nAzure database for my SQL Azure database\nfor postgrades which are fully managed\nrelational database Services as for gcp\nwell it follows in the steps of the\naforementioned providers by offering\nservices like Cloud SQL a fully managed\nrelational database service that\nsupports popular database engines such\nas MySQL by the way um I think it's\npronounced me SQL I read somewhere that\nthe creator of database has two girls\none is me and the other one is Mariah so\nI think it's actually me sequel not my\nsequel anyways it supports my slash me\nsequel what's the great Sequel and SQL\nServer there's also Cloud spanner a\nglobally distributed relational database\nservice there's Cloud bigtable a fully\nmanaged nosql database service and\nthere's Cloud datastore a fully managed\ndocuments database service gcp also\noffers Cloud firestore a fully managed\nCloud native nosql document database\nservice\nthat was a mouthful and for the last\nitem on my comparison list I wanted to\nexplore a domain I'm not very familiar\nwith the no code slash low code area\nthat's taken the World by a storm\nrecently since the public release of\nchargept and all the AI Tools around it\nso when it comes to creating and\ndeploying applications without writing\ncode slash writing the least amount of\ncode possible AWS offers a wide range of\nsuch services including AWS uprunner\nwhich allows customers to build test and\ndeploy containerized applications\nquickly and easily there's AWS cold star\nwhich allows customers to quickly\ndevelop build and deploy applications on\nAWS and AWS honeycode which is built to\nsimplify manual tasks no programming\nrequired as for handling data with no\ncode AWS offers AWS glue ETL service\nwhich enables customers to extract\ntransform and load data for analytics\nand data warehousing through a series of\nclicks and Scrolls Azure seems to follow\nsuit as well by offering similar no code\nServices as AWS such as Azure logic apps\na service that allows customers to\ncreate workflows to automate business\nprocesses and integrate with other Azure\nservices and there's also power automate\nwhich allows customers to automate\nbusiness processes and integrate with\nother services this one actually was\nsuspiciously suspicious sys\nsuspiciously similar to AWS honeycomb\nAzure also offers Azure data breaks\nwhich allows customers to build train\nand deploy machine learning models\nwithout writing code and as for gcp I\ncould only find one cloud service that\nwas the cloud data flow which allows\ncustomers to build to test and deploy\ndata processing pipelines without\nwriting code so maybe someone who's\nknowledgeable about gcp can chime in in\nthe comments with more gcp no code\nservices that I must have missed now at\nthis point I was exhausted my goal was\nto try to find an area where there was a\nclear winner but the same patterns keep\noccurring regardless of which domain I\nlooked at AWS turned out to be more\ncomplete as you're more user friendly\nand gcp more easy to start with but I\nhad to take some time to think about\nthis and after a while I realized how\neach of these providers has its own\nunique strengths and on weaknesses AWS\nis known for its reliability and\nrobustness with a long track record of\nuptime and a huge network of data\nsensors around the world Azure is\nparticularly strong in the areas of\nartificial intelligence and machine\nlearning and offers a number of tools\nand services to support these\napplications and gcp is a great choice\nfor those who want a more open and\nflexible platform with a wide range of\nOpen Source tools and Technologies\navailable so which one is the best well\nit really depends I know you hate this\nanswer but it really depends on what you\nneed honestly if you're a large\nEnterprise with Deep Pockets and a need\nfor a wide range of services AWS might\nbe the way to go if you're a developer\nor a startup on a tight budget just he\ncould be a great fit and if you're\nsomewhere in the middle Azure then might\nbe the perfect compromise but you know\ndon't take my word for it it's important\nto do your own research it's important\nto figure out the cloud provider that is\nthe right fit for your specific needs\nand that's where we come in we will be\ndoing a series of videos they're going\nto dig in\nand that's where we come in we will be\ndoing a series of videos digging into\neach of these providers in more depth so\nstay tuned thank you very much for\nwatching and don't forget to hit that\nsubscribe button to stay up to date on\nall things cloud computing see you in\nthe next video peace out\n",
