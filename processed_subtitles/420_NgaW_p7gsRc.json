put\nthis philosophy class\nin an engineering building?\nHold on one moment, please.\nI'm speaking, and I will get\nto you when it's your turn.\nI am Professor Breck Knowles.\nThis is Advanced Ethics.\nYou should be upper-class\nphilosophy majors.\nThat should be\nall right in here.\nCan you please wait your turn?\nPlease.\nThis is the textbook.\nNow, this textbook covers some\nof the most important topics\nacross ethics, edited, of\ncourse, by yours truly.\n[CHUCKLES]\nI expect you all to have\nit, and you can pull that--\nnone of you have it.\n[SIGHS] The bookstore must have\nreally messed up this time.\nNo.\nWhen you do get it, make sure\nyou get the new latest edition.\nI don't get my cut\nfor used books.\nNow, if you turn the page\n432, that's my chapter.\nCould you read?\n[CLEARS THROAT]\nChapter 18, \"Bias\nis Bad,\" by Brack Know-less.\nKnowles!\nIt's Knowles.\n[SIGHS] You surely don't know\nhow to impress your professors.\nYou read.\nWhen investigating the\nsocietal implications of bias\nwithin the framework of\nnon-hierarchical dependencies,\nwe must integrate that the\ntaxonomy of bias and inequity\nare combinationally intertwined.\nFirst and foremost, bias affects\nboth the sub- super-conscious--\nApologies for being late.\nComputer systems\nask me to help fix\na glitch that\nhappened this morning\nand affected which classrooms\na few professors are sent to.\nHi.\nI'm Sophie Muller.\nI don't think we've met.\nThat's what I was trying to tell\nProfessor Know-less, that he's\nin the wrong classroom.\nMy apologies.\nThe problem with the software\nupgrade this morning,\nbut it's all fixed.\nThis is not the advanced class?\nNo.\nThat's what I was\ntrying to tell you.\nWe are in engineering ethics.\nWell, I always am supposed\nto teach the advanced class.\nI don't want to be\nstuck with beginners.\nBut where am I supposed to go?\nLet's see.\nKnowles?\nYour class is all of the way\nback in the philosophy floor\nin the subbasement of\nbuilding seven, room 001.\nA bit of a hike, I'm afraid.\n[CHUCKLES] Always get\nstuck in the cave.\nExcuse me.\nDo you want your book back?\nThank you.\nYou engineers can make something\nthat US philosophers deserve.\nJust--\n[LAUGHTER]\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nHow is everyone doing?\nOh.\nI guess I didn't introduce\nmyself to all of you.\nI'm Sophie Muller.\nI'll be taking over\nfrom Professor Baer, who\nhas been asked to run\nan important project\non the ethics of AI.\nDid you have a\ngood spring break?\nYeah.\nThat's good, but the\nregistration list\nsaid 40 students.\nWhere is everyone else?\nYeah.\nWell, the others went to\ngo hear the president speak\nabout the new administrative\norganizational structure.\nHe's changed it again.\nThird time this year.\nMhm.\nThe university president.\nSounds interesting.\n[CHUCKLING]\nBut I thought students almost\nnever go to such things.\nYes.\nBut since no one goes to\nthese and the president\ndidn't want to speak in front\nof an empty auditorium again,\nhe offered everyone\nfree food and drink\nand allowed them\nto break the rules\nand eat and drink\nin the auditorium.\nHe also hired a large\nsteam cleaning crew,\ncomplete with industrial\ndrying equipment\nto clean up right afterwards.\nI see.\nOh.\nI realized that I\nintroduced myself\nbut got distracted\nby our conversation\nand didn't have you\nintroduce yourselves.\nWhat are your names?\nAlyssa.\nI'm Patch.\nMy name is Sophie.\nAlvis.\nGlenda.\nPleased to meet you.\nWell, nice to meet\nall of you too.\nSo, you were telling me about\nthe event going on right now.\nBut why aren't you five there?\nYes, Sophie.\nWell, professor, don't\ntell anyone else,\nbut we're really\ndedicated to understanding\nthe ethical issues\nof bias in AI.\nIn fact, instead of\ntraveling over spring break,\nwe just stayed here to\ndiscuss ethics altogether.\nAnd we looked at the resources\nthat we could find online.\nYour dedication is admirable.\nWhat did you find\nin your research?\nWell, there are a bunch\nof videos and articles\nonline, but--\nBut what?\nWe found them unsatisfying.\nWhy is that?\nAlyssa.\nWell, not everyone\nfound them unsatisfying.\nI thought they made\nsome good points.\nWell, you weren't able to\nexplain away their failings.\nWere you?\nNo, but you weren't able\nto give a better approach.\nWere you?\nHold on, you two.\nAlways bickering.\nWe didn't answer\nprofessor's question.\nProfessor Muller, we found\nthem unsatisfying because they\ndidn't give us an answer.\nThat's right.\nThey told us that\nit's a problem,\nand they said that\nit's a hard problem,\nbut they didn't tell\nus how to address it.\nIt's more than that.\nThe videos on bias in\nAI are all the same.\nThey all say it's in\nthe data set-- bias in,\nbias out-- and they keep\nrecycling the same examples.\nSome videos have better\ngraphics or better speakers,\nbut other than that,\nthey're all the same.\n[SCOFFS] So conformist.\nYeah.\nAnd while they say that\nbias is in the data set,\nthere seems to be\nno general solution.\nThey just indicate that for\neach algorithm the issue of bias\nneeds to be researched.\nEven for that, they don't\ngive a systematic approach.\nYeah.\nEven if you could choose\nthe right data set\nand quantify it on\nthat data set to ensure\nno bias in your training\nset for a given analysis,\nyou have no way to know if\nthat applies to all situations.\nMy point is that we all\nagree that bias is bad.\nWe simply need to address\nit in every single algorithm\nthat we make.\nYes, I agree.\nWe don't want any\nbias in our AI.\nWe want everyone to be happy.\nThis is a good start,\nbut perhaps it's\nbest if we get to specifics.\nAlyssa, what were some of\nthe good points regarding\nalgorithmic bias\nthat you mentioned?\nFor example,\nalgorithms are biased\nagainst underrepresented\nminorities.\nFacial recognition doesn't\nwork as well for Blacks\nas it does for Whites,\nespecially Black women.\nOne common example shows\nthat while it identifies\nWhite males nearly perfectly,\nit misidentified Black woman\nover 20% of the time.\nWell, one algorithm gives\n20% error and the other 30%.\nThey can't even be\nconsistent in their bias.\nIf we can't nail down the\nextent of the problem,\nhow do we fix it?\nYou could at least work to\ntry to make sure that the data\nset is more representative.\nOh, and what about the algorithm\nthat identifies Indian brides\nas actors?\nWell, why should they complain?\nBeing identified as an actor\nis the greatest honor anyone\ncan have.\nOh, very funny.\nI like chicken sandwiches.\nHow would you like it if\nan algorithm identified you\nas a chicken sandwich?\nOK.\nI see why they call it\nan adversarial example.\nIn any case, it's not\neasy to address bias\nacross the board\nbecause of skews\nin data sets due to\nhistorical inequities.\nAnd those skews differ.\nAt least we know that there\nhave been historical inequities\nthat we need to address.\nAnd while it may\nnot be easy to do,\nwe have to at least try, even\nif it's on a case-by-case basis.\nEven if it is on a\ncase-by-case basis,\nwe're doomed to\nmiss a lot of bias\nuntil long after\neveryone is equal.\nAnd I for one am\nnot that patient.\nWell, this problem\nis so important\nthat even if it takes a very\nlong time and even if we\nhave to do it\nalgorithm by algorithm,\nthat is what we should do.\nIf we all do this,\neveryone will be happy.\nBut no, many people\nwon't be happy\nwaiting for the bias to go away.\nSo, professor, this is where\nwe got stuck over spring break.\nIt's just not\npractical to engineer\nevery algorithm against bias.\nEven if we could, we would\nend up eliminating it\nin a few dimensions.\nBut then we're bound to miss it\nin other important dimensions.\nAbove and beyond\nthat, we can't even\nquantify the bias consistently\nsince different studies\non the same data set give\ndifferent amounts of bias.\nWe know that we need to do\nsomething to address bias,\nbut what the videos say will at\nbest take a small step forward.\nWe know that others may\nbe content with that,\nbut it's not sufficient for us\nto feel good about ourselves.\nNo, it's not.\nAh.\nYou have reached an impasse,\nwhich, believe it or not,\nis often a necessary place to\nbe before you can make progress.\nI think, however, it's best if\nwe take a step back and explore\nhow these algorithms work\nand the roots of wanting\nto eliminate bias.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nSo you probably all know\nthis, but just to remind you,\nthe overall approach is simple.\nYou start out with a\ntraining set of data\nhere together with descriptors,\nwhich we use to derive a model.\nThen we input the data,\nand the model classifies it\nbased on some criterion.\nObviously, the devil\nis in the details.\nBased on this\nhigh-level approach,\nwhere do you see bias?\nThere's no bias here.\nThe algorithm-- say, a\nconvolutional neural network--\nobjectively analyzes\nthe data provided to it.\nIt's just math.\nIt is not just math.\nWe choose the training set.\nWe choose the algorithm.\nEven if we think that\nwe are not biased,\nwe are subconsciously biased.\nHow do we actually\nchoose them if everything\nis described by mathematics?\nWe don't really have a choice.\nDuh.\nThe bias is already in the data\ndue to historical inequity.\nYou said it yourself.\nSo then our choice is\nto note that and add\nan appropriate loss function.\nDoes everybody know\nwhat a loss function is?\nOf course.\nYes.\nYeah.\nA loss function is\njust the error function\nassociated with an event,\nsuch as facial recognition.\nIt is what should be\nmathematically minimized.\nGood.\nJust to clarify, it\nshouldn't be simply minimized\nacross the board but\ntargeted, for example,\nso that the overall error\nin facial recognition\nis minimized with the\nconstraint that it is\nequal among different groups.\nBut unless you have\nequivalent training sets\nfor the different groups,\nthe statistical errors\nwon't be equivalent.\nAnd you can't quantify\nthe errors in advance\nto determine whether or not\nthey will be equivalent.\nIn other words, you can't choose\nthe loss function approach\nto solve the problem because\nthe fluctuations or randomness.\nThe problem is statistics.\nWe have to have\na very large data\nset to average out randomness\nto acceptably small percentages\nand make sure that our\ndata is representative.\nYes, but my point is that\nit's just not possible.\nI agree that we\ncould make the error\nrates in facial\nrecognition algorithms\nequal for Whites and Blacks\nand for men and women.\nBut what about all the other\nracial and ethnic minorities?\nAnd for that matter, what about\nall the different genders?\nEven if we could\nagree on what groups\nneed to have bias eliminated,\nwe can't practically\naddress them all.\nYeah, and that's not\neven how the field works.\nNo one's going to spend five\nor 10 years for each algorithm\nto eliminate bias.\nFor cutting-edge\nresearch, people just\ntry to hit 80%, sometimes 90%\naccuracy for a given algorithm\nand then publish a paper on it.\nThe incentives are such\nthat they can't spend years\ngetting 99% or so accuracy\nacross the board, at least\nfor new algorithms.\nThere just isn't enough data.\nBetter to just get\nsomething out there,\neven if it's not so good, so\nyou at least get credit for it.\nIf we could only\neliminate randomness,\nour problems would be solved.\nBut randomness is good because\nit's the basis of choice,\notherwise our minds would just\nfollow a deterministic path\nbased on our neural pathways\nand electrical signals.\nThe heart of it is\nquantum mechanics,\nwhich introduces\nintrinsic randomness.\nWell, randomness doesn't\ngive you choice, just chaos.\nThat's also the\nreason we have bias\nto begin with, because of\nrandom historical circumstances.\nWe want to eliminate bias,\nnot just make it random.\nIf it is random, then\nmaybe you will mitigate it\nfor minorities, or\nmaybe, at least for some,\nyou'll find a way to augment it.\n[SCOFFS] That is what\nI was saying, too.\nSo we seem to be stuck again.\nMathematics is the rigorous\nway to understand the world,\nbut it doesn't give us choice.\nIn the world described\nby mathematics,\nchoice is an illusion.\nProfessor, we ran\ninto the same impasse\nwhen we had this discussion\nlast week during spring break.\nBut how do we get out of it?\nI think I can be\nof some help here.\nSo you all agree that it is\ndesirable to eliminate bias,\nright?\nYeah.\nYes.\nSo you all think it is possible\nto mitigate bias depending\non what actions you take?\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSo you do think that can make\nchoices and not just randomly.\nMore well-grounded\nchoices are better than\nless well-grounded ones,\nsay, for addressing bias.\nI don't think we really\nhave a choice about things.\nPeople might think that they\ndo, but they don't really.\nWe can't choose where we are\nborn or how smart we are,\nand we can't choose if\nwe get hit by a car.\nWe think we are making a\nchoice, but we really aren't.\nIt's like Sophie said.\nIt's all just an illusion.\nYeah.\nYeah, you're right.\nRandomness doesn't help.\nYou've convinced me.\nWait.\nDid I have a choice, or\nwas I compelled to agree?\nNo.\nYour neurons told you to agree.\nYes, exactly.\nAnd randomness, a consequence\nof a chaotic quantum process,\njust makes what we\ndo not predictable\nbut doesn't mean that\nwe choose what we do.\nRight.\nWell, you have a choice whether\nyou're going to be biased\nor not.\nMhm.\nIndeed.\nIt does seem that\njudgments involve choice.\nBut Alyssa, if you were\ngiven the full understanding\nof a situation, wouldn't you\nalways take the best action?\nYeah, of course.\nNo.\nYou can't really choose whether\nanything is better or worse.\nIt's all just a value judgment.\nYou may be compelled to\ndo something by others,\nbut you never really\nfreely choose.\nDo you really believe\nthat, or are you\njust playing devil's advocate?\nOK.\nA little of both.\nBut even if I am just\nplaying devil's advocate,\nwhat's wrong with\nwhat I'm saying?\nWhat's wrong is that your model\nof human life is inadequate.\nIt doesn't describe\nwhat it really is.\nWe're not just some balls\nmoving around deterministically\nwith random noise interspersed\nlike a term in a Langevin\nequation.\nIsn't that true,\nProfessor Muller?\nWhat a great discussion this is.\nSounds like you had\na much better spring\nbreak discussing these questions\nthan going to the beach.\n[CHUCKLES]\nI think you're on the\nright track, Sophie.\nFunny.\nCoincidentally, that's\nmy first name too.\nAt any rate, you have\nunveiled a great tension\nin modern science.\nWe are brought up to think\nthat modern science is the way\nto describe the\nworld, but it seems\ninadequate to\ndescribe human things.\nEthical questions cannot be\nreducible to mathematics--\nsimilar to justice and\nbeauty, hope and suffering,\nand, for that\nmatter, even truth.\nYes, Glenda.\nAren't those things even more\nimportant than modern science?\nI would say so.\nNo.\nThose things are\narbitrary or a matter\nof individual's interests--\nwhat's in it for them.\nThat's the way to look\nat them scientifically.\nBias exists because people\nhave conflicting interests.\nSure, if you look at it\npurely scientifically,\nbut interest alone cannot\nbe adequate since people are\nwilling to sacrifice interests\nfor passions and, more\nimportantly, for things\nbeyond themselves.\nAt any rate, do most\nof us really know\nall of our interests?\nWe all have preferences that\ngo far beyond interests.\nPerhaps we can say at best that\nthose interests are intertwined\nwith different\napproaches to the world.\nBesides, aren't the most\nboring people the ones who say,\nI'm right, and, even if one\ncan never make value judgments,\nI have my own values\nand I stick with them?\n[CHUCKLES] Yeah, these are\nthe most irritating and boring\npeople.\nSo, now let's dig down a bit\nmore into the mathematics\nof AI and the sorting problem.\nPerhaps it's best to start\nwith a specific example.\nWhat's the reason for the\nbias in facial recognition\nthat we discussed\na little while ago?\nA biased training set due\nto historical inequity.\nOK.\nSo one of the issues\nis the training set.\nThe other issue\nis the algorithm,\nincluding its hyperparameters,\nall leading to how\nthe classification is done.\nThis is why different algorithms\ngive different error rates\nusing the same training data.\nAnything else?\nRight.\nSo those are the two key issues.\nHowever, within the\nchoice of algorithm,\nthere is the problem\nwith classification.\nLet me project\nthis data set, here\nwith points in red and blue.\nYou have many choices for\nputting the dividing surface.\nBut what if we\nchoose the wrong one?\nSome of the data may be\nmisclassified, won't it?\nYou mean like this?\nYes, exactly.\nSo how do you choose the\nright line ahead of time?\nThat is a problem.\nIt could be even worse if\nyour data set looks like this.\nBut then we don't have\nto stick with lines.\nWhy don't you draw\na curve around them?\nLike this?\nYes, exactly.\nNow you've classified\nthem all perfectly.\nWell, wait a second.\nIf you do that, it works\nfor the training set,\nbut it may not work for\nany additional data sets.\nIn fact, it might be\neven worse than the lines\nbecause you're overfitting\nto the training data.\nDo you mean like this?\nYeah.\nThat doesn't work.\nOh, yes.\nI see it.\nExactly.\nRemember this is a sorting\nalgorithm, here in two\ndimensions with two descriptors,\nthus it is quite limited.\nBut even if you do it in a very\nlarge number of dimensions with\na very large number\nof descriptors,\nyou are still projecting\na complicated system--\nshall we say a natural system--\nonto an artificial\nmathematical construct\nthat necessarily leaves\nmuch out of the description.\nOr if you want to stay in\nthe realm of mathematics,\nyou could say that due to\na necessary incomplete set\nof descriptors you\nwere fitting noise.\nThis allows you to get a perfect\nfit for your training set,\nbut then you have an even\nworse fit for your data set\nmoving forward.\nPatch.\nIn other words, we\nhave to accept the fact\nthat there will be errors.\nBut at least we could distribute\nthe errors evenly among groups.\nThat is what Alyssa said before.\nWe can try, but\nthen I'm worried we\nwon't include all the groups.\nEven if we could, there'll\nbe errors in the errors.\nUnless we have a very,\nvery large training\nset, which practically\nwe never have,\nwe won't be able to do that.\nYes.\nThe training set would\nhave to incorporate\nall the data in the world.\nYou know, that\nreminds me of a story\nI once heard, I think from\na South American writer,\nwhere someone makes a one-to-one\nscale map of their country\nwith all the details included.\n[CHUCKLES]\nHa, ha.\nWell, I grant the problem.\nBut then what do we do?\nWe all agree that we\nneed to eliminate bias,\nbut it seems so hard.\nWhat if we could at least\nhave a very extensive model\nthat for all practical purposes\ncaptures a given situation?\nWhich I guess is\nactually impossible\nbecause it would require a\ncomplete and accurate model\nof all the objects\nin the whole world.\nYes.\nAs engineers, we can at\nleast work to do that.\nIf the model is extensive\nenough, we can eliminate bias.\nBut then we'd be eliminating any\nchoice that we might have had.\nWe would be controlled\nby an algorithm.\nThat sounds-- that\nsounds tyrannical.\nIndeed.\nMathematization of human\nthings distorts them so much\nthat they become something\nwhich they are not.\nThis is actually the\nutilitarian approach.\nHuman things like joy, anger,\njustice, honor, beauty,\nand happiness are really\nnot mathematizable.\nWe lose all of what\nis important in them\nwhen we mathematize them.\nWe could in principle try to\ndo so and therein transform\nhuman reality.\nGlenda.\nThat doesn't sound appealing.\nIt sounds dreadful.\nYeah, that wouldn't be good.\nBut we can at least do\nit partially, can't we?\nYes.\nMaybe that would\nbe a good solution.\nYes.\nEven if those human\nthings cannot be described\nby mathematics, it is still the\nonly rigorous way to understand\nthe world.\nI'm not so sure anymore, but\nthe bias is in the data set,\nand it is in the algorithms.\nSo we must be able to adjust\nour models to solve the problem.\nMustn't we?\nWell, consider this-- our\nrecognition of the problem\nof bias is not mathematical.\nMathematics comes only\nafter such recognition.\nMathematics is something\nwe impose on our broader\nunderstanding of the world.\nWe can use it to develop\nmodels, but they will always\nbe just that, models\nwhich are necessarily\nincomplete descriptions.\nI see what you're\nsaying, I think.\nSophie.\nBut AI is based on mathematics.\nSo we have to fix this\nproblem in the algorithms\nvia fixing the algorithms, i.e.\nby using mathematics.\nDon't we?\nWell, we can think\nof things this way,\nbut that will lead us\nto a double whammy.\nWe cannot develop a\nnon-arbitrary definition\nof the criteria for the\ntraining set, and, two,\nwe cannot develop a\nnon-arbitrary definition\nof the error target for\nthe sorting algorithm.\nWell, I knew that we\nwere at an impasse,\nbut I didn't think it\nwas this big of one.\nProfessor, your\nclass has made us\nmore stuck than we were before.\nSo, what do we do?\nIs there another way?\nIndeed, Glenda, there is that.\nIt requires a reconsideration of\nour concerns and of the issue.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n[DOOR CLOSES]\nThank you.\nSophie.\nSo, what is the other way?\nWell, let's think about it.\nWe just showed that because of\nthe intrinsic incompleteness\nof models eliminating\nbias in all dimensions\nis mathematically impossible.\nWe could no doubt decrease\nbias among some groups\nto a certain degree, with an\nacceptably small but still\nsignificant margin of error.\nEven if we got rid of bias in\nsome predefined dimensions,\nwe would still have it\nin other dimensions.\nBut that's precisely it.\nWe want equality in at\nleast some dimensions,\nthe important ones.\nThat is good.\nHow do you choose which\ndimensions are important?\nAlvis.\nOne important\ndimension is wealth.\nGood.\nSo even you five, the\ntop engineering students\nin your class at the top\nengineering school, should get\npaid just as much as someone\nlike Dean, the paper collector.\nWell, he is a very nice\nfellow, if a bit strange.\nBut no, we think we should be\nrewarded for the contributions\nthat we make to society.\nBut wealth should be\ndistributed more equally.\nThat's right.\nBut how do you decide\nhow equal it should be?\nPerhaps the problem\nis once again\nthat mathematics in its\nhomogenization of kinds\nis not the right way\nto address the problem.\nLet me ask you this--\nis it really equality that\nyou want, or is it justice?\nJustice.\nYeah.\nI'll go with justice.\nGreat that you two\nagree on something.\nGlenda.\nThey should go hand in\nhand, justice and equality.\nYeah.\nIsn't equality justice?\nI think we need to add\nanother consideration,\nsince we are beginning to\ndelve into the complex human\nquestions underlying\nour definition\nand perception of bias.\nSo let me ask you this.\nWhich is most important--\nequality, justice,\nor happiness?\nSophie.\nI would say happiness.\nEven if someone has\nmore than you do,\nand even if they\ndon't deserve it,\nit doesn't matter to you\nas long as you are happy.\nThink of all the people\nborn into rich families.\nThey're typically\nnot happy since they\ndon't need to have a goal, and\ntherefore they don't have one.\nI would still have a goal if I\nwere born into a rich family.\nWhy do they need\na goal if they're\nhaving such a good time?\nBecause people need to\nhave a purpose to be happy.\nAnd how can people be happy\nif they're not treated fairly?\nSo we have equality,\njustice, and happiness,\nbut it is unclear which\nis most important.\nGlenda.\nCan't they be of\nequal importance?\nActually, no.\nThey are certainly interrelated.\nBut since they are at\nleast somewhat different\nand since, as we saw, they\ncan conflict, one of them\nhas to be most important, has to\ntake precedence over the other.\nI think that justice is more\nimportant than equality.\nAfter all, we don't want\neveryone to be the exact same,\nbut still justice and\nequality are related.\nPeople can be unequal because\nthey're treated unfairly.\nThey can also be unequal\ndue to luck, good or bad.\nI don't think that happiness\ncan be the standard.\nWe need equality, and that's\nwhy mathematics is still\nso important, because we\ncan employ it rigorously\nto make everyone equal.\nBut if everyone is the same,\nwouldn't the world be drab?\nI mean, what if all\nof us were the same?\nWe wouldn't even be able to\nhave this dialogue, as we'd all\nbe making the same point.\nThere would be\nnothing interesting,\nas everyone is reduced\nto a forced homogeneity.\nBesides, how do\nyou make everyone\nequal without\nviolating their rights?\nWe're going to have to\nviolate some rights to make\npeople at least more equal.\nBut then maybe I guess\nthat's not justice.\nYeah.\nIsn't it the essence of tyranny\nwhen rights are violated\nin the name of justice?\nYes.\nWe have strong reasons\nnot to want that.\nWe want equality,\nbut we certainly\ndon't want to violate\npeople's rights to get it.\nBut what do we do?\nHere we are at an impasse again.\nHow do we understand\nthis conflict\nbetween equality and rights?\nBy the way, professor,\nwhat about that other way\nthat you promised?\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nI was wondering when you\nwould want to go to that.\nDo you remember learning\nabout modern natural right\nfrom Professor Baer\nbefore spring break?\nYes, a bit.\nWe studied Locke's state of\nnature and its connection\nwith natural right, if that's\nwhat you're talking about.\nProfessor Baer\nalso made the case\nthat modern natural right is the\nbasis for the American regime\nand the reason for\nthis country's success.\nGood.\nAnd yes, that is\nexactly what I mean.\nIt's great that you\nremember reading\nLocke and about\nmodern natural right\nbeing the basis for\nthe American regime.\nOh.\nHello, Professor Knowles.\nWhat are you doing here?\nI hope I'm not bothering you.\nI heard that you were\ndiscussing modern natural right,\nand I wanted to join.\nThe stuff you heard\nme spew earlier\nwas a front that I\nhave to put forward\nto my colleagues in the\nphilosophy department,\nand some students who\nappreciate such things.\nIt's the only way I\ncould keep a job, which\nI need to be able to\npursue true philosophy.\nThat is refreshing to hear.\nAnd yes, please do join us.\nWe were just starting\non modern natural right.\nSo how does Locke view the\nproblem of AI and bias?\nPatch.\nLocke would think it\nwrong because bias\nviolates your natural right.\nYes, I agree.\nThat sounds right,\nbut I'm not sure\nbecause we said that justice is\nmore important than equality.\nBut it seems that equality\nis fundamental in Locke.\nBut then where is\njustice in Locke?\nLet's take this step by step.\nDoes anyone remember\nthe beginning?\nBut you said you were\nworking on these questions\nduring spring break.\nAlvis?\nWell, we were discussing them,\nbut we never actually went back\nto the texts from class.\nYeah.\nWe just wanted to figure\nthem out for ourselves.\nI guess you disapprove,\nProfessor Muller?\nOn the contrary.\nYou are a very\nimpressive group to have\nstayed here over spring\nbreak and investigated\nthese questions.\nAny teacher would be thrilled to\nhave even one student like you,\nand I have five.\nBut you said that you got stuck.\nWhat was your plan to\nget out of your impasse?\nWell, your class, of course.\n[LAUGHS]\nHush, Patch.\nYou seem not to realize\nthat Professor Muller is\nin a most mild way\nrebuking us for not\nusing the resources at hand.\nWell, let's use them now.\nProfessor, please remind us\nof Locke's starting point.\nOf course.\nLet's turn to second\ntreatise, chapter 1.\nProfessor Knowles, where do\nyou think we should start?\nI'd say the last section\nof paragraph one,\nstarting with \"he that.\"\nThat is exactly\nwhat I was thinking.\nGlenda, could you\nread the statement\nstarting with \"he that?\"\nOf course.\nHe that will not\ngive just occasion\nto think that all\ngovernment in the world\nis the product of only\nforce and violence\nmust of necessity find out\nanother rise of government.\nGood.\nSo Locke is giving\nus two options\nof the origin of government,\nforce or something else--\nmaybe something\nelse based on reason\nbut not narrow or\nmathematical reason.\nYes, of course.\nThat is much better.\nIt would be terrible to\nthink that politics is just\nabout force.\nI agree.\nIt should be about\nallowing people\nto be happy, as we said before.\nBut what does this\nalternative basis?\nYou can look at your\nbooks, you know.\nAlvis.\nIt is the state of nature.\nGood.\nWhat is the state of nature?\nWell, let's see.\nI actually underlined\nthis pretty extensively.\nIt is a state of perfect freedom\nand a state also of equality.\nYes.\nI remember now.\nBut how can it be a\nstate of perfect freedom\nif anyone can take your\nstuff and it's only up to you\nto protect it?\nYou don't remember?\nThat's the point.\nThere is no government,\nso we're all\nperfectly free in that sense.\nBut life is not\ndesirable since we're\nall individually vulnerable.\nThat's why we form\ngovernments, for security.\nVery good, Sophie, but\nyou're moving too fast.\nRemember Locke says but though\nthis be a state of liberty,\nyet it is not a\nstate of license.\nDo you recall why that is?\nOh, hold on.\nI have it right here.\nBecause of a law of nature.\nYes, that's it.\nLaws of nature are\nbased on reason.\nYeah.\nWe talked about that\nbefore spring break.\nNow I remember.\nIt's dumb to waste stuff,\nincluding your own life.\nWhat about these people\nthat waste their money\non luxuries, expensive\ncars and things?\nYeah.\nI'd be content with\na cheap rundown car.\nWhy should someone buy a\nFerrari when most of us\ncan't afford an old Kia?\nDoes anyone recall\nLocke's answer to this?\nPerhaps, once again,\nwe are moving too fast.\nLet's go step by step.\nWhat is the state\nof nature like?\nAlvis.\nIn addition to freedom and\nequality, there is a law.\nGood.\nWhat else?\nThere is punishment.\nIn paragraph seven, he\nsays everyone has a right\nto punish the transgressors\nof that law to such a degree\nas may hinder its violation.\nVery good, Sophie.\nI think we will see that\nour objection to bias\nis itself based on a sense\nthat there is a law of nature.\nHow does Locke characterize\nthis statement?\nHe says in paragraph nine that\nthis will seem a very strange\ndoctrine to some.\nExcellent.\nDoes it seem strange to you?\nWell, not any more strange\nthan the state of nature.\nWhy is the state\nof nature strange?\nSo nature is what you\nexperience when you go on a hike\nor go camping.\nWhat Locke is describing\nnever really existed.\nWhat do you think\nexisted in its place?\nSo humans evolved\nfrom humanoids,\nand they lived in tribes.\nThey weren't by themselves.\nRight, Patch.\nBut what is the basis of the\nrule of the tribe leader?\nPower.\nBut isn't this exactly what\nLocke said at the beginning?\nWe can have tribal\nrule based on power,\nor we can have an alternative,\nwhich Locke provides.\nBesides, don't you think\nhuman beings' natural state is\nfreedom and equality?\nThat all makes sense.\nBut then why does Locke call\nit a very strange doctrine?\nTo some.\nSee, I think that will\nfind that what is required\nis not so much a new doctrine,\nsay a learned latent structure\nfor algorithmic bias mitigation\nor domain adaptation,\nbut a reflection\non what doctrine\nsome find strange\nand others do not.\nWhat's strange to us actually\ncontradicts our own biases.\nPsychologically, we tend\nto resist those things\nbecause they point out\nour biases to ourselves.\nOh, I see.\nWhat we find strange is an\nindication of our own bias.\nThat's what Locke is saying.\nThank you, Professor Knowles.\nAnd I realize that he\ndefends this doctrine\nby arguing that governments\ncan punish foreigners\nwho break a law,\nwhich is related\nto the example in\nparagraph 14, when he says\nthat by the state of nature\nexists today, since all princes\nand rulers of\nindependent governments\nall through the world\nare in a state of nature.\nVery good, and then he\nbrings in the next paragraph\nthe weight of the writings\nof Hooker, or shall\nwe say the judicious Hooker.\nAnd he ends the chapter\nwith the idea of consent.\nSo political society is made\nlegitimate only by consent.\nWell, since we\nare short on time,\nI'll have to move on to\nchapter five on property.\nBut explore when\nyou can what he says\nabout the state of war and\nslavery in the Skip chapters.\nWe will also come back\nto other subtleties,\nlike why he calls the\ndoctrine by everyone\nin the state of nature\nhas executive power\nthis strange doctrine\nin paragraph 13\nand, for that\nmatter, why there is\nno authority in the state of\nnature besides each individual.\nSo what are his key\narguments on property?\nAlyssa.\nOne is that each of us has a\nproperty in our own person.\nThat's in paragraph 27.\nGood.\nAnd later in paragraph 27, that\nwe make things our property\nby mixing our labor\nwith things from nature.\nVery good.\nYeah.\nI like the acorn example.\nBy picking up an\nacorn, we make it ours.\nI guess that applies\nto fruit, too.\n[LAUGHTER]\nAnd he says in paragraph\n26 that the Earth is ours\nfor the support and\ncomfort of our being\nand that we're given\nreason to use it well.\nThat brings me back to\nmy point from before.\nSomeone isn't using it\nwell if they're rich\nand they hoard things.\nWell, you can only\nhoard so much.\nLike, who needs 10 Ferraris?\nI do.\nHa, ha.\nHa, ha, yourself.\nThe point is that you cannot\nhoard because your things will\nspoil.\nYes.\nThat is why he talks\nabout money somewhere.\nMoney doesn't go bad.\nYes, in paragraph 36.\nBut you'll see that he\nsays in paragraph 31\nthat everyone can take as\nmuch as he wants from nature,\nbut there is a limitation.\nWhat is that limitation that\nprevents us from accumulating\nso much that things spoil?\nWell, what is also present\nin nature besides things\nyou can take?\nOh, yes.\nThe law of reason.\nIt's stupid to hoard because\nthen you're just wasting stuff,\nand that's against\nthe law of reason.\nBut once there is money, you\ncan hoard it without spoiling.\nSo why isn't that wrong to do?\nBecause you put\nyour labor into it?\nBut what if you're just lucky?\nOr what if you inherited it?\nOK if I answer this one?\nIt's because someone else\nput their labor into it,\ntherefore they can give\nhowever they choose.\nExcellent.\nThanks.\nDo you recall how much\nLocke says labor increases\nthe value of what is in nature?\n100 times in paragraph 40.\n1,000 times in paragraph 43.\nBoth 10 and 100 times\nin paragraph 37.\nAnd since we mentioned\nparagraph 40,\nwe should point out\nhis famous statement\nin the subsequent one.\nA king of a large and\nfruitful territory in America\nfeeds, lodges, and is clad worse\nthan a day laborer in England.\nSo whatever the\nfactor of increase is,\nthe point is not just that\nlabor is almost all the value\nin property but that\nby protecting property\nwe will all benefit\nwith many good things.\nYes, like this university.\n[CHUCKLES]\nExactly.\nI still don't think it's fair\nthat some people have so much\nmore than others.\nBut we all benefit.\nBesides, if it weren't\nfor this system,\nyou wouldn't even be able\nto get that broken-down Kia\nthat you dream of.\nOh.\nHa, ha.\n[LAUGHTER]\nBut even if the pie\ngets bigger and bigger,\nsome people will\nstill control others\nbecause they have\na bigger piece,\nmaking those people unhappy.\nOr do you mean less free?\nIf so, it seems that AI doesn't\nsolve the problem at all.\nOf course, some people\ndo think that it can,\nthat mathematization\nof all things\ncan lead to a sort\nof techno utopia.\nLocke is giving us a choice.\nWe can be controlled by\nalgorithms designed by smart\nbut unworldly people working\nlong hours in some basement--\nor let's call it a cave--\nor we can be allowed\nour own choice.\nOf course, that choice\nshould be the product\nof thoughtful reflection,\nparticularly on our own biases.\nBut AI could give more\nfreedom, couldn't it?\nI see what you're saying.\nCertainly, it can bring\nbenefits in health care\nand transportation and make\nmany things more efficient.\nBut intrinsically it\ncan't solve the problem\nof bias even in itself.\nActually, it's even worse.\nThose who develop and\ntherefore control AI\nwill build AI systems biased\nfor their own benefit.\nHmm.\nHmm.\nHaving said that, I\nrealized that we somehow\nseem to have gotten\ndistracted from understanding\nhow natural right can help\nus to address bias in AI.\nAnd we only have a few\nminutes of class left.\nI was wondering when you\nwere going to realize that.\nWell, you convinced\nus that all AI systems\nwill be biased in\nsome dimensions\nno matter what you do.\nBut then you also\nconvinced us that property\nshould be respected.\nSo, what do we do about bias?\nYeah.\nAnd how should we\npunish people who write\nunacceptably biased AI systems?\nOr reward them for making\nacceptably biased AI systems.\nI mean unbiased AI systems.\n[LAUGHTER]\nYeah.\nWe can't reward\nor punish people,\naccording to Locke's system.\nOn the contrary,\nwe can reward them\nby buying their\nproducts if we like them\nor punish them by not\nbuying their products\nif we don't like them.\nSo transparency is the key?\nYes, if people are willing\nto pay for transparency.\nYou see, the law of\nnature addresses that too.\nAnd in most\ncontemporary approaches,\nthere is an\nassumption, one which\nwe have been\naddressing today too,\nthat bias is bad and\nshould be eradicated\nby technical mathematical means.\nWe now understand that a deeper\nreflection on the law of nature\nand the law of reason is\nneeded, but we engineers\nneeded to see the limitations\nof the mathematical or computer\nscience approach\nfirst before we turn\nto a broader or deeper one.\nYeah.\nI think I understand\nthis now, but it still\nhasn't changed one thing.\nI want a Ferrari.\n[SCOFFING, CHUCKLING]\nThe point is under the Lockean\nsystem we are all better off--\nhappier, we could say--\nbecause algorithms\nwith unacceptable\nbias will go away because\nno one will buy them.\nYou're starting to understand.\nEarlier, you mentioned\nutilitarianism,\nand you showed not only\nthat AI is tied up in it\nbut that it doesn't treat\nthe human things well.\nBut what I didn't\nreally understand\nis that we still need to\nmake utilitarian choices,\nlike allocation of resources.\nCould you show us how to\nthink about that necessity\nwithin the realm\nof human things?\nYes, I can.\nWe did say that utilitarianism\nas a form of thought\ntends to give an incomplete\naccount of human concerns\nand passions, no\nmatter how much we\nstrive to make the\nmathematical model complete.\nBut we did indicate that\nengineering is utilitarian\nand that it always strives\nto optimize some function.\nHow we should think about\nthat for human benefit\nwould be the subject\nfor next class.\n[BELL RINGS]\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n",
