  "text": "hey my name is Felipe and welcome to my \nchannel, in this video I'm going to show  \nyou a fully comprehensive computer vision roadmap \nI'm going to show you all the skills you should  \nlearn to become a computer vision engineer\nand all the different ways \nin which you can specialize in computer vision\nand I'm also giving you very specific resources \nyou can use in order to learn all the skills \nI show you in this roadmap and now let's get started\nso let's get started with \nthis computer vision roadmap, in this\nvideo I'm going to show you an entire roadmap in \norder to go from zero from scratch from having  \nabsolutely no background in IT whatsoever up to a \ncomplete expert computer visual engineer so let's  \nget started the first step you should follow \nin this roadmap is covering the fundamentals  \nand when I say fundamentals I mean Python and \nopencv these two skills are definitely the most  \nimportant skills you should start with in order to \nbecome a computer vision engineer, and this video,  \nthis computer vision roadmap is an updated version \nof one of my previous videos, and in this version  \nI have added some specific resources you can take \nyou can follow in order to learn all the different  \nskills I am going to show you in this roadmap so \nin order to Learn Python and in order to learn OpenCV  \nyou can take a look at these two resources I have \nadded over here and regarding opencv this is a  \nthree hours long fully comprehensive course of \nopencv with python and I definitely recommend  \nyou to check out this course but if you do not \nhave three hours in order to take this course  \nthen these are the most important lessons you \nshould take in order to cover the basics of  \nopencv with python so if you do have three hours \nthen please take a... take a look at this course but  \nif you do not don't worry you can just take some \nof these lessons and you are going to cover the  \nmost important aspects of opencv with python so \nthis is the first step you should take in order to  \nlearn computer vision, in order to become a computer \nvision engineer and now let's continue the next  \nstep in this roadmap is the basics of machine \nlearning, machine learning is very very very  \nimportant in computer vision and these are the \nmost important things you should learn, these are  \nthe four most important tasks in computer vision \nimage classification object detection semantic  \nsegmentation and pose detection and this is the \nway I recommend you to learn machine learning by  \nlearning how to solve these four very specific \nproblems, these four very specific tasks, so by  \nlearning how to build an image classifier how to \nbuild an object detector how to build a semantic  \nsegmentation algorithm and how to build a pose \ndetector oh my God you will have learned so much  \nmachine learning and you will be super super \nproficient in machine learning these are the  \nmost important machine learning tasks in computer \nvision and these are some very specific resources  \nyou could use in order to learn how to solve \nthese problems right these are some courses  \nand some tutorials I recommend you in order to \nsolve these problems in order to learn how to  \nsolve these problems and by doing so by solving \nthese problems you are going to learn how to use  \nsome very specific tools which are... let me show you \nscikit learn yolo V8 yolo nas pytorch tensorflow  \nand many many many more tools and please pay \nattention because this is very very very important  \nthese are the tools we use in order to solve these \nproblems right but the important thing is not the  \ntools we use the important thing is the problems \nwe are solving by using the tools right so my  \nrecommendation for you is do not focus on learning \nhow to use the very specific tools but focus on  \nhow you are going to solve each one of these \nproblems and by doing so you are going to learn  \nhow to use different tools right my recommendation \nfor you is do not focus on learning the tools  \nfocus on learning how to solve these very specific \nproblems but if you are one of those people who  \nprefer to learn the tools that's perfectly fine \nI have also added some resources for you right  \nbecause I know we all have different preferences \nso if you prefer to learn how to use the  \ntools these are some resources you could use right \nbut remember my recommendation is do not focus on  \nthe tools focus on how you're going to solve \nthe high level problems image classification  \nobject detection semantic segmentation and pose \ndetection which are perhaps the most important  \nmachine learning problems in computer vision now \nlet's continue and you can see that from here from  \nbasic machine learning you can take it in either \none of these two paths let's take it over here for  \nnow and later on I'm going to show you what's \nover here so following this path we have the  \nspecialization right now that you feel confident \nin Python and opencv, now that you have learned  \nthe basics of machine learning now it's time to \nspecialize right and you have many different ways  \nto specialize one of these different ways is low \nlevel programming and electronics which basically  \ninvolves C++ and how to work with an \nedge device for example Arduino or jetson nano  \nand the reason this is one of the ways in which \nyou can specialize in computer vision is because  \nalthough C++ is a very very very important \nprogramming language you can definitely take up  \nmany projects as a computer vision engineer \nand you can just become a computer vision  \nengineer without really doing anything related \nto low level programming or anything related to  \nelectronics right it's perfectly possible so this \nis one of the ways in which you can specialize if  \nyou want to go deep into low level programming if \nyou want to go deep into working with electronics  \nworking with robotics for example then you can \njust specialize and you can do it learning C++  \nand learning how to work with this type of \nedge devices now another way in which you can  \nspecialize is by taking the research path \nright, by doing research and this  \ninvolves learning very advanced machine learning \nand also very advanced mathematics there's a huge  \nmisconception in computer vision which is that you \ndefinitely need very advanced mathematics and you  \ndifferently need to know how to work with very \nAdvanced mathematical objects and operations in  \norder to do computer vision and that is not true \nthat's a misconception that is false I can tell  \nyou that you can definitely work in the field as \na computer vision engineer and you can definitely  \ntake many many projects and you can definitely \nmake a lot of money as a computer visual engineer  \nby knowing Python opencv and the basics of machine \nlearning only by knowing these skills you will be  \nable to solve the machine learning part of many \nmany projects and you will be able to solve many  \nprojects. Knowing the advanced mathematics and \nthe advanced machine learning and the advanced  \neverything is not absolutely needed that's why this \nis... I consider this is one of the ways in which you  \ncan specialize right and if you want to take this \nroute these are some very specific resources you  \ncould take right and I forgot to mention these \nare some very specific resources you can follow  \nin order to learn this other way to specialize in \ncomputer vision which is low level programming and  \nelectronics but let's continue now let's take \nit to the other way which you can specialize  \nwhich is generative Ai and this basically involves \nimage generation and also text generation right this is  \nsomething that I would say it's huge already \nit's already a very very important field in  \ncomputer vision and my thoughts are that in the \nnext few years this is going to be bigger and  \nbigger this is going to be a very very important \nfield in computer vision and these are some very  \nspecific tutorials from my own YouTube channel \nyou can take in order to learn how to work with  \nimage generation and text generation in a computer \nvision project now let's continue these are  \nsome of the ways in which you can specialize \nin computer vision these are definitely not  \nall the ways in which you can specialize there \ncould be other ways but I think these are some  \nof the most important paths you could take as \na computer vision engineer but now let's take  \nit back remember that from basic machine \nlearning we could take another path right let's  \nsee what's over here and this is where we have \nall the software related skills right because  \nremember as a computer vision engineer you are \nnot working on a vacuum right you are working  \nwith other software developers you are building \nproducts you are doing some things which involve  \nsoftware so the more you know about software \nthe more software related skills you may have  \nis going to be much much more better for you \nand these are some very specific examples of  \nsome very specific software skills which are very \nimportant in computer vision as a computer vision  \nengineer you definitely need to know how to work \nwith a Version Control software for example GitHub  \nyou'll definitely need to know how to work with \nDocker is going to be a plus for sure in your  \ncareer if you know how to work with Docker it's \nvery important you know how to work with a cloud  \nprovider with a cloud development platform for \nexample AWS Google cloud or Azure and it's also  \na plus it's something very important if you are \nfamiliar with web development technologies let me  \ntell you a very quick story about me about myself \nwhen I was just starting in computer vision I  \ncompletely underestimated how important it is all \nthese software related skills and I thought that  \nby learning Python opencv and the Very basics \nof machine learning the very Basics by learning  \nhow to build an image classifier, the very basics \nof machine learning I was all set I was ready to  \nwork in the top companies in the field to work \nin Google in Tesla in SpaceX... I thought I  \nwas ready, that was all, that was it, and I was \nwrong I was so so super wrong for many different  \nreasons and one of them is because I completely \nunderestimated all these software related skills  \nif you are going to work in computer vision \nyou'll definitely need to know something other  \nthan computer vision and this is very important \nbecause this is very often underestimated by many  \npeople in the computer vision industry or in \nthe machine learning industry there are many  \npeople who believe who think that by learning \nthe basics of machine learning that's it  \nthat's not all if you're going to work in the \nfield or you need to know something other than  \ncomputer vision and these are some very specific \nresources you could take in order to learn all  \nthese skills and also remember that working in a \ncompany as an employee it's only one of the many  \nmany different career choices you can take in your \nprofessional career you could also be something  \nlike a freelancer, a freelance computer vision \nengineer, and if you decide to be a freelancer  \nand a client hires you to do something like \nbuilding a machine learning model, building  \nan object detector and serving this model through \nan API and you tell the client 'okay I can help  \nyou building the model but in order to serve it \nthrough the API hire someone else because I don't  \neven know what's an API' the client is going to \nsay something like 'oh okay okay I am going to  \nhire someone else, I'm going to hire someone else \nto do the entire project is going to be much more  \naffordable it's going to be much more easier to \nmanage than if I hire many different developers  \nto make each one of the tasks in this project' so \nthis is especially the case if you decide to be  \nsomething like a freelancer because the moment \nyou tell your client you don't know how to do  \nsomething the moment this client replaces you by \nsomeone else so this is very important if you want  \nto be a freelancer as well now let's continue \nI have already show you the entire roadmap you  \nshould take in order to become a computer vision \nengineer with very specific resources and I have  \nalso shown you all the different ways in which \nyou can specialize as a computer visual engineer  \nnow let's continue because now it's time to \nshow you how to enhance your skillset, how to  \ngrow your skills and one of the ways in which you \ncan grow your skills as a computer vision engineer  \nis by working on projects by making projects by \ndoing projects by hands-on experience working  \non projects and there are two different ways in \nwhich you can do that one of them is by following  \ncoding tutorials and projects in YouTube, \nand there are many many projects you can take you  \ncan do on YouTube these are only a few examples \nof some of my tutorials of my projects in this  \nYouTube channel and you can also take many paid \ncourses right if you want to take your skills a  \nstep further if you really want to become like \nan absolute expert then you also have many paid  \nresources you could use in order to enhance your \nskillset even further right and these are only  \na few examples also from my own paid products for \nexample this is a project which is available in my  \nPatreon and in this project I show you the entire \nprocess of how to build a video summarization API  \nI take you from the requirements up to the project \ndeliverable and I show you every single step of  \nthis process how to do the planning how to do the \nsystem design how to work in the execution every  \nsingle step of this process and this is exactly \nhow a real world computer vision project looks like,\nthen this is another example this is also \navailable my Patreon and this is a very Advanced lesson  \non how to train a machine learning model and it \ninvolves how to control the randomness when you  \nare training a machine learning model this is \na very very Advanced lesson and these are a few  \nresources you will take in order to enhance your \nskillset as a computer vision engineer and then  \nyou also have other resources and in these other \nresources are for example books you could read  \nbooks on computer vision in order to improve \nyour skill set as a computer vision engineer  \nthese are only a few examples of some of the books \nyou could read in order to become a super absolute  \nexpert computer vision engineer then another very \ninteresting resource is joining a community and  \nthese are some examples this Discord server is \nthis YouTube channel Discord server right this is  \nour community and this is a very very interesting \nresource the way usually work is that the members  \nof our community post the projects in which \nthey are currently working in and everyone else  \nrecommend this user different things he or she can \ndo with his or her project we say something like  \nhey have you tried to do this have you tried to \ndo the other thing have you tried to do this with  \nthe data I don't know we collaborate in many \ndifferent ways so we help everyone with their  \ncomputer vision projects this is a very very very \ninteresting resource in order to go deeper into  \nyour knowledge of computer vision then these \nare some subreddits you could consider, computer  \nvision, machine learning, these are some super \nhigh levels subreddits but you also have  \nmany other subreddits which are very very valuable \nin order to learn more about a very very specific  \nniche for example this one about stable diffusion \nI have used this subreddit a lot lately because I  \nhave been learning a lot about stable diffusion and \nthis subreddit is perhaps one of the most valuable  \nresources in order to learn stable diffusion \nso these are only a few examples of some of the  \ncommunities and some of the subreddits you could \nuse and then another very interesting resource in  \norder to go deeper into your computer vision \nknowledge is joining a competition, competing  \nwith other people that's oh my God that's going \nto take your skill set a step further for sure in  \norder to do so I recommend you to use kaggle \nwhich is perhaps the most important and the  \nmost relevant site in order to do competitive \ncomputer vision in order to join a competition  \nin which you have to train a computer vision \nmodel and compete against other competitors so  \nthis is going to be all for this computer vision \nroadmap please let me know what you think in the  \ncomments below if you enjoyed this video I invite \nyou to click the like button and I also invite you  \nto subscribe to my
