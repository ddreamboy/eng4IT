  "text": "at first glance Microsoft OneDrive might\nbe a bit overwhelming or even confusing\nto use but if you know the basics and\nhow to use onedrive's functionalities\nproperly it's actually quite simple and\nstraightforward so let me show you what\nyou need to know when setting up or\nusing OneDrive to have the best\nexperience regardless if you're using it\nby the browser or your file explorer\nput simply OneDrive is Microsoft's cloud\nstorage service that stores and connects\nall your files you can create store\nmanage edit share backup restore or\ncollaborate with others via OneDrive and\nacross multiple devices it's not only\navailable for when you're online but it\neven lets you use your files in offline\nmode\none drive is included in all Microsoft\n365 Office 365 and SharePoint plans and\nalso can be purchased separately most of\nyou will have it available via your 365\nsubscription for personal use or at work\none more free way to make use of\nOneDrive is by creating an Outlook email\naddress this just takes a few steps and\nwill grant you five gigabytes of free\nstorage if you're using Windows 10 or 11\nOneDrive will already be pre-installed\non your computer and you can make use of\nit right away if not you can download it\nfrom this website either for your\ncomputer or your Mac I leave the link to\nthis website and the one where you can\ncreate your free outline email address\nin the description just as the link to\nmy free newsletter in which I share so\nmany more insights beyond the ones in my\nYouTube videos so make sure to subscribe\nnow and just as with any other Microsoft\napp OneDrive is also available for\nmobile both for Apple and Android\ndevices you can find it either in the\napp or the Play Store by searching for\nOneDrive having installed the app you\nwill be able to view edit or share your\nfiles not only on your desktop but also\nwhen being on the go\nback to your desktop computer where you\nwill see a little Cloud icon in your\ntaskbar which symbolizes OneDrive\navailability clicking on the icon you\nwill see a list of documents that have\nbeen uploaded or synchronized most\nrecently on top it will tell you if your\nOneDrive is currently up to date if it's\nprocessing changes or if there's a sync\nissue by clicking on the little gear\nicon on top right you will get to the\nOneDrive settings which I will cover\nlater in the video more important for\nnow are the three big buttons at the\nbottom that let you open the OneDrive\nfolder on your computer view it online\nin the browser or access a recycle bin\nby the browser as well let's first look\nat the browser version of OneDrive that\nlists all of your files and folders\nunderneath each other by default you can\nchange this view by clicking on the top\nleft and choose a compact list or tiles\non the left side you can find the\nnavigation bar that lets you access all\nof your files the ones recently created\nedited or uploaded your photos documents\nor files you have shared with other\npeople and the recycle bin you can\naccess the bin either like we just did\nor directly via the third button in your\nOneDrive overview when clicking on the\ncloud icon on your taskbar the browser\nview is very similar to the one you can\naccess via your file explorer either by\nclicking on open folder via the cloud\nsymbol or just by navigating to your\nOneDrive folder in your file explorer\nhaving clicked on it it will appear\nbesides all the other standard folders\nin your file explorer and show the same\nfiles and folders that you have seen in\nthe browser view\nstaying with the file explorer let's see\nhow you can edit and work with files and\nall this is no magic and really not very\ndifferent from just working on your\nlocal drive but there are some specifics\nyou need to know if you want to create a\nnew file just open for example a new\nword document and make sure to save it\nin your OneDrive deleting something from\nyour OneDrive is similarly simple and\ncan be done by pressing the delete\nbutton or by right clicking and deleting\nfor personal OneDrive accounts whatever\nhas been deleted will be kept in your\nrecycle bin for 30 days in case you\nwould like to restore a document\nthereafter it will be cleared to access\nthe recycle bin you need to go to your\nbrowser OneDrive view ideally via the\napp on your taskbar one of the best\nfeatures of OneDrive at least in my\nopinion is the ability to view each\ndocument's history and even have the\nability to restore older versions of\nthat document you just need to do a\nright click on any document with a\nhistory so if for example a word\nPowerPoint or an Excel file and click\nview history this will open a new window\nwith the files complete version history\nfrom the date of creation you will see a\nlist of automatic backups that OneDrive\ndid in the background or whenever the\ndocument was closed and saved as well as\nthe person that modified the documents\nhow long ago and what size the document\nhad at that point in time by clicking on\nthe three little dots that appear when\nhovering above a specific version you\ncan either restore or download this\nversion of the document but you cannot\nrestore an older version whilst the\ncurrent one is open but you can always\ndownload an earlier version which is\ngreat to for example compare a current\none with what has changed from two days\nago\nnow you might have seen and wondered\nalready about the different icons that\nare shown in the status column which is\nunique to OneDrive accessed via the file\nexplorer those symbols tell you the sync\nstatus of the respective OneDrive files\nin total there are more than 20\ndifferent symbols but I bet in 90 of the\ncases you will only need the following\nones the solid green circle with the\ncheck mark means this document is always\nsynchronized to your device this means\nit takes up space on your device but\nwill also be there even if you're\noffline the light green tick icon means\nthat this file used to be an online only\nfile that has been downloaded to your\ndevice having become a locally available\nfile again both when you are being\nonline or offline the blue cloud icon\nmeans that this file or folder is only\navailable online so it does not take up\nspace on your computer but can also only\nbe accessed if you are connected to the\ninternet whenever you see a people Icon\nit means that this file or folder has\nbeen shared with other people I will\ncover a few more sharing settings in\njust a bit and another important symbol\nis the blue Sync icon which means that\nthis file of folder is currently being\nsynced to the cloud you can also hover\nwith your mouse above the respective\nicon and it tells you what it means but\nthose icons cannot only be seen next to\nyour files and folders but also your\nOneDrive app icon in your taskbar might\nshow one of those icons from time to\ntime mostly it will be this one meaning\nthat OneDrive is currently being synced\nto the cloud or this one which means\nthat there is a sync issue usually you\ncan just click on the app symbol so it\nguides you through the bug fix but if\nyou would like to learn more about\nfixing sync or other issues with\nOneDrive let me know in the comments\ndown below as well as make sure to hit\nthe like button and subscribe to the\nchannel if you found the video helpful\nso far\nsharing is another great OneDrive\nfeature that allows you to collaborate\nwith others to share a file or folder\njust do a right click and go to share\nwithin the context menu just as the\nother five or so features below this is\nonly available when working with\nOneDrive documents having clicked share\nthis new window will pop up and lets you\nspecify the sharing options on top you\ncan edit the overall permissions and\nshare the file or follow with anyone or\njust with specific people at the bottom\nyou can also choose if that person has\nfull access and editor permission or if\nthey should just be able to view the\ncontent but cannot make any changes in\naddition you can set an expiration date\non which the permissions would expire\nfor example if someone would just need\nto have access for two days before\nsending type in the email address of the\nperson you would like to share the file\nas well as an optional message that they\nwill receive together with the sharing\nnotification via email alternatively you\ncould just copy the link to the filer\nfolder and share it for example directly\nvia WhatsApp or teams to change share\nsettings you need to go via the OneDrive\nbrowser version that you can access by\nright clicking on the file or folder and\nchoosing to view it online now click on\nshared next to the document you would\nlike to manage access for and adjust the\nsharing settings by either removing\nindividual people or changing their\npermissions\none other really great and maybe even\nunique feature about OneDrive is the\navailability of a personal Vault this is\na special folder that you can set up\nonly by having access via two-factor\nauthentication so to access the\ndocuments within the personal Vault you\nwould first need to log into your\ncomputer or OneDrive and second complete\nthe two-factor authentication with your\nphone or email to get inside your wallet\nthis extra layer of security is great if\nyou have documents like scans of your ID\npassport or driver's license that you\nwould like to store in a more secure\nplace\nnow going back to the OneDrive settings\nthat you can access via the cloud icon\non your taskbar there are some important\nthings you need to be aware of in\ngeneral I would recommend going through\nall of the different settings once so\nyou know what's available and what can\nbe changed one of the most important\nsettings in my opinion is the choice of\nfolders that you would like to\nsynchronize you can adjust this by going\nto your account and clicking on choose\nfolders the list shows you which photos\nor subfolders are currently being synced\nwith your computer and shown in your\nOneDrive file explorer view in case you\ndon't want to keep or don't need access\nto some folders locally you can just\nuntick the boxes and they will be\nunsynced this might make sense if you\nwant to free up a lot of space at once\nor if you just need some specific\nfolders on a second or third device such\nas a laptop that you're traveling with\neven though working with OneDrive should\nbe quite intuitive at least by now it's\nstill very important to keep it clean\nand or organized such that you will\nalways have an overview of your files\nand folders this however is not always\nan easy task which is why you should\nwatch this video next where I will show\nyou how you can organize your files and\nphotos so you will never lose sight of\nany document anymore\n",
