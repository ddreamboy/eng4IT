  "text": "this video is sponsored by AVG there are\nfive things that make a good cloud\nstorage service and so in this video I'm\ngoing to run you through what those five\nare and how each of these cloud storage\nproviders stack up they're some of the\nmost popular names you've probably heard\nof as well as some of the most popular\nAlternatives there have been a few\nchanges recently so this video should\nprovide you with an up-to-date guide if\nyou're looking for somewhere that is\nbest to store your data now links will\nbe down below this video for each of\nthem some of them have some pretty\nincredible discounts on them which we'll\ntalk about more in a moment so let's\nstart off with something that everybody\nstarts with and that is pricing so from\ncheapest to most expensive and for those\nthat you do pay monthly I'm going to\ngive you the full Year's cost just so we\ncan compare here and I'm going to throw\nthem up on the screen so we can see for\nyourself but I just want to point out\nsome differences here now firstly most\nof the prices there are for two\nterabytes of storage however iDrive\ngives you five terabytes and you also\nhave a special first year offer at just\n7.95 for the whole year which you can\nget using the link down below this video\nbut after that first year it then\nincreases to the still the lowest price\nof all the others but I just wanted to\nshow that comparison without the\ndiscounted pricing for now Microsoft\nOneDrive the most they offer is just one\nterabyte of data pcloud has a 10\ndiscount which I'll link again down\nbelow but other than that purely based\non pricing I drive absolutely smashed it\nout the park there so if you are purely\nlooking at pricing then I drive kind of\nwins at this stage sync also provides a\nvery affordable service in comparison\nwith its other features which we'll talk\nabout in a moment and the big players\nlike Google Apple Dropbox they all sit\nat the very top of that price point now\nif you do have a lot of data and perhaps\nyour after unlimited storage then you\ndon't have any options as a consumer but\nif you upgrade to some of the business\ntiers unlimited storage does actually\nbecome an option again I'm going to put\nthese prices up on the screen now but\nstill the pricing isn't that bad 30\nbucks a month at best and 100 bucks a\nmonth at worst for completely unlimited\nstorage which if you hold a you know a\nlot of data still isn't that bad but\nwhilst pricing is one thing that most\npeople focus in on first there are some\nkey differences that you need to be\naware of when choosing a service so in\nterms of features all of these services\nwill work on pretty much every device\nyou've got Apple Windows iPhone and\nAndroid with one exception of course\nwith iCloud whilst you can use it on\nWindows and Android devices I'd only\nreally recommend iCloud if you're an\nApple user with you know an iPhone a Mac\nand and or an iPad just because you get\nthat full Apple experience by doing so\nit's kind of like running Windows on a\nMac it does kind of work but it's just\nit's just not designed to do that so if\nyou do have a mixture of devices one of\nthe other services may be better suited\nnow again they all have fairly similar\nfeatures and similar desktop functions\nhere you can share files and folders\nsome of them even look similar but\npretty much all of these once installed\nwill just show themselves as an extra\nfolder on your computer which you can\nuse to move things in and out just like\nyou know any other folder does there is\none specific feature that I wanted to\ncall out here though which to most\npeople can make a significant difference\nto how they use the service and that's a\nfeature called Online files now Online\nfiles means you can still access all\nyour files and folders directly from\nyour computer's desktop you don't\nactually download the file until you\neither open the file or you choose to\ndownload it typically by like right\nclicking the file and choosing to\ndownload now most of the ones I've\ntested so far have this feature iDrive\ndoesn't have that feature sync does have\nthe feature but you have to download the\nsync cloud files beta clients which\nisn't really advertised anywhere and has\nbeen in beta for pretty much a year I\nthink but that does work well once you\nactually get there so what I want to do\nhere is to highlight some limitations\nhere which may take you one step closer\nagain to deciding which one is the best\nfor you now the first limitation is\naround the maximum file sizes again I'm\ngoing to show them on the screen here\nfrom smallest to largest but those sizes\nwill limit the size of individual files\nthat you can upload now reading through\nthese limitations for most people the\nonly one you might want to be careful\nwith here is iDrive and maybe iCloud\nbeing at 50 gig but with that said I did\nupload some larger files to r-drive and\niCloud and I didn't have any issues so\nit looks only to be a recommended limit\nrather than a hard stop now I know that\n10 gig files are kind of few and far\nbetween unless you like know that you're\ncreating those large types of files for\nexample some of the video files are\nuploaded from my editor can be up to 100\nGig in size but for most people all\nthose limits aren't going to cause you a\nproblem at all a quick shout out once\nagain to AVG for sponsoring this video\nAVG offers protection for Macs and PCs\nacross business and personal computers I\nactually remember using AVG Internet\nSecurity way back in the 90s on my dad's\ncomputer so they have Decades of\nexperience with a product that's always\nbeen excellent at blocking bad things\nfrom getting onto your machine to get up\nto 60 off for the first year click on\nthe link down below and check out their\nmulti award-winning security and\nfeatures such as enhanced\nanti-ransomware and additional\nprotection on accessing your webcam to a\nfirewall that blocks anything suspicious\nand with their 4.3 star rating on\ntrustpilot you can be sure that you're\nin safe hands so thank you once again to\nAVG for sponsoring this video and for\nsporting a small Creator such as myself\nnow the next potential limitation is how\nfast each of these services are in terms\nof uploads and download speeds so I'm\ngoing to throw the results up on the\nscreen once again rather than wasting\nyour time explaining each one but all of\nthese tests were done when uploading a\n10 gig file to each service and then\ndownloading that 10 gig file back again\nand I did this multiple times and at\ndifferent times of the day to check if\nit was consistent now most of them are\npretty close some of them really not\nsync.com shockingly slow I drive also\nnot great but then at seven bucks a year\nI kind of expect that OneDrive was also\npretty slow to download compared to the\nothers Dropbox was actually the fastest\nto download and then Google Drive was\nthe fastest to upload for me number\nthree or maybe four wheel now on the\nfive things every good cloud service\nneeds is to protect your data this is\ntypically by what they call data\nretention which is how long they'll\nstore old copies of your data sometimes\nit's how many versions of a file they'll\nstore now what none of these services do\nfor you is back up your data they do\nreplicate your data to like multiple\nlocations so there's no issues of losing\nyour data if one of their locations gets\nhit by like a fault or a natural\ndisaster but generally speaking it's\nalways best to use a different service\nto actually backup your data because\nwhat's the point of say Microsoft\nbacking out your data and then Microsoft\nstuff as an outage or if you delete\nsomething for example and you don't\nrealize it until a few months later it's\ntoo late to recover it but data\nretention is some something that some of\nthese cloud services do offer which\nmeans you have the ability to roll back\nand recover data to a certain point now\nI would argue here that sync.com\nactually has the best standard\nprotection at 180 days whereas you need\nto upgrade to Dropbox Pros or business\nlevel to get that same protection and of\ncourse at a higher cost pcloud also\noffers the option to upgrade to one year\nof retention which is actually pretty\ngood but does then make it very\nexpensive in comparison to the others so\nsync is now one of the cheapest and has\nsome of the best retention but some of\nthe slower speeds damn it's really not\nmaking my job here that easy but that\nisn't all because the next thing you\nshould be concerned about is the\nsecurity of your data normally it's the\nlast thing people worry about but I\nthink it is still very important to\ncover in one of these videos now firstly\nthe good news here is that all of the\nservices support two-factor\nauthentication as a bit of a standard\nbut I want to highlight a few here so\nGoogle Drive Dropbox OneDrive and as of\nJanuary 2023 Apple's own iCloud all\nsupport the use of one of these UB Keys\nwhich is as far as I'm concerned one of\nthe best ways to protect your count from\nbeing hacked so without having this\nphysical key for example you can't\naccess your data so it's very very\ndifficult for someone to get into your\naccount without your key now I'm going\nto leave a link down below to buy these\nbecause not many people seem to know\nabout them still but secondly is a\nphrase known as zero knowledge\nencryption now this means that even if\nsomeone did get into your account and\nfind your data they couldn't access it\nor do anything with it because they\ndon't have the decryption Keys now\nunfortunately the likes of Google Drive\nDropbox OneDrive and until recently\nApple they aren't zero knowledge now the\ncompanies themselves hold the keys to\nyour data so if someone does get in they\ncan browse your data and still take what\nthey want so if you want to secure your\ndata you want to use a zero knowledge\nservice now of the list we're looking at\nthat means iDrive sync and apple\nactually surprisingly but with apple\nit's not very obvious we actually have\nto go into the settings menu and enable\nit on one device for it to kind of roll\nit out to all your devices but I'll link\nto a video from a friend of mine Josh\nfrom All Things secured I'll pop it up\nhere on how to do that now pcloud is\nalso zero knowledge but you do have k\nfor their add-on which is called pcloud\ncrypto which is an awfully named product\nit sounds like something to do with\nBitcoin when it's completely not and\nthat is also a 50 a year add-on making\nit the most expensive option of all the\noptions we're looking at now now the\nlast thing I think is important when it\ncomes to Security is to see if any\nbreaches have recently happened and so\nas far as major breaches go only Dropbox\nhas had a recent one in November of 2022\nwhere names and addresses for employees\ncustomers leads and vendors were\npotentially stolen but no customer data\nwas compromised but honestly with that\nsaid even though none of the other\nservices had any major breaches we all\nknow that accounts get hacked like daily\nthere was the massive iCloud leak of you\nknow celebrity photos a few years ago a\nseemingly endless list of people who get\nthere Google and Microsoft accounts\ncompromised but this doesn't typically\nhappen because the service itself has a\npoor implementation of security and\nactually comes down to how we as users\nof those Services poorly Implement our\nown security so if you are honestly\nconcerned about the security of your own\ndata I.E not wanting anyone else to get\ntheir hands on it then I would recommend\nlooking for one of these zero knowledge\nencryption services so after taking all\nof this information into account where\nwould I place my recommendations well I\ndrive is cheap and secure but slow but\nat seven bucks for like the first year\nyou can't really complain there now\nsync.com feels like it's the best\nall-rounder it just sucks for me that\nit's so slow to upload and download in\nmy most recent tests but I would\nrecommend you give it a try first like\nmaybe you can find your speed results\nare a lot different to mine and you can\nalways just ask for refund if it doesn't\nwork well for you either otherwise you\ncan't actually go wrong with sticking\nwithin your own ecosystem so Apple\nMicrosoft or Google if you're already\nwith them given that you get all the\nextras like Microsoft desktop apps or\nthe Google Docs just make sure that you\nsecure your accounts properly with the\nUB key now the good news is that I\nwouldn't say any of these services are\nbad Services it's not like my password\nmanager review where I found some pretty\nsignificant issues with some of them but\nuntil next time\n[Music]\n",
