  "text": "[Music]\n[Applause]\nwhen i was 10 years old i was playing\ncool math games as you do on your free\ntime\nand i noticed something in the corner of\nmy eye while i was playing didn't\nimmediately give it too much attention\nbut after a while i realized the gravity\nof my situation and i quickly gasped for\nair\ni just won a new iphone 5s\nno way i thought to myself so of course\ni clicked the pop-up immediately\nand input my parents email address\nregular address phone number you know\nto get me the iphone of course\na few hours later my dad comes yelling\nat me that i downloaded something called\nmalware onto the computer\nbut i told him calm down just just wait\nfor the iphone okay\nnow waiting days became weeks weeks\nbecame months months became years and to\nthis day i still do not have an iphone\n5s ladies and gentlemen i believe i have\nbeen scammed\nnow\nthe reason i illustrate this many of you\nhave probably had a similar experience\nor under know somebody who's had a\nsimilar experience\nis that our relationship with technology\nhas been\nsimple like that it felt more like a\nwestern movie wherever every now and\nthen there were some bandits but you\nknow it was you could deal with it and\nyou could get a little google search in\nthere every now and then\nbut as technology becomes more complex\nso does our relationship with technology\nwhen i talk about technology becoming\nmore complex i'm mostly referring to the\nadvent of ai technology in today's day\nand age how many of you have a social\nmedia account\nplease raise your hands i should be\nseeing everybody because there's no way\nyou don't have a social media account in\nthis day and age\neverybody has a social media account and\nthe main\ninteraction with that social media\naccount is artificial intelligence or\na system that is designed to mimic human\nintelligence and learn through data now\nit gets a bad rap because of literally\nevery sci-fi movie however at the end of\nthe day it's such a cool concept to\nthink about\na system that can manipulate large\namounts of data and learn from it that's\nkind of incredible if you think about it\nwe could be solving problems like\ntransportation energy environment\nwe could count how many people in this\nroom have red shirts\nthat probably wouldn't be that useful\nbut at the very least we could do it\nall that being said instead of being\nused to solve those grand problems we\nare having it recommend us motivational\nshack clips on tick tock\nif i see him rip the paycheck in half\none more time i'm going to lose it\nnow with this obviously i'm referring to\nthe commercialization of artificial\nintelligence technology in terms of\nmarketing\nimagine if you will a man that is in\nyour house every day staring at you\nlike that watching your every move\nbreath everything you eat\nwhile you sleep it's pretty unnerving\nright and then all of a sudden every\nlike 10 minutes or so he tries to sell\nyou like a football or something\nthat is essentially how artificial\nintelligence is being used for marketing\nand frankly it's unearthing\nat the same time\nwhat if you know that same guy locked\nthe doors in your house and you couldn't\nescape and all you had was him standing\nright there selling you advertisements\neveryday and night watching you day and\nnight it\nit would be pretty creepy right can we\nall agree on that be pretty creepy i see\nsome head nods thank you\nuh\nfrankly\nthat is essentially what's being done\nthough\nyou at home\nat youtube yes we're getting meta with\nthis one\nmake sure to like comment and subscribe\nyou're probably eyeing that video over\nthere in the corner i see you yeah\nyou're probably gonna click that one and\nthen after that you're gonna find\nanother video you click that one you're\ngonna keep going down this rabbit hole\nchained to this endless scroll\ni like that endless scroll that sounds\ndramatic\nfrankly\nwhen you're chained to that endless\nworld it's hard to think about anything\nelse and while youtube continues to\nfeed you advertisement after\nadvertisement\nit gets it's pretty obvious that the\nreason that you're being shown content\nthat you'd like to watch that you'd want\nto see more of is so that you can be\nmarketed to so you can be advertised to\nagain closing the doors in your own\nhouse and having a guy watch you all the\ntime\ni mean it's a pretty extreme metaphor\nbut when you really think about it it\nkind of makes sense\nall of this\ninstead of being used to solve problems\nfrankly the way that big tech is using\nartificial intelligence\nis irresponsible and this is just a\nmicrocosm of the many ethical issues\nthat come with artificial intelligence\nyou have artificial intelligence and\nrace bias which is something that i\nnever thought i would say in my life\nyou have artificial intelligence making\nweapons why are we making weapons\nat the end of the day\nwe have to understand that there's\nsomething wrong with how we are doing\nartificial intelligence in its most\ncommercial form and so how are we going\nto address other ethical issues of\nartificial intelligence if we don't even\naddress the most basic one\nand that's why we need to start teaching\nkids how to use artificial intelligence\nin schools\nwe need you know let's let's face it big\ntech is not gonna stop\nyou know they're they're making billions\nof dollars and frankly\nif i was worth 44 billion dollars\nthis talk would be very different\nhey guys artificial intelligence is\ngreat and used perfectly\nfrankly\nthey're not going to stop so we need to\naddress the problem at its root\nthe future\nwe need to start teaching the future\ngen future problem solvers and airs if\nyou will who will be using artificial\nintelligence to solve problems\nhow to solve those problems with ai\nwe need to create an ethical framework\nfor them perhaps you know\nlet's let's focus again not on\nkeeping people chained to an endless\nscroll let's focus not on creating\npolitical divide within our country\nthrough echo chambers\nthat perhaps we can understand\nokay\nwe need to\nmake ai\nnot like this how we're doing it right\nnow so and make it more productive in\nthe future\nit's kind of like how we need to be\nteaching kids how to use the internet\nand how to be safe on the internet\nthough frankly we could be doing a\nbetter job with that as well\nat the end of the day\nunderstanding the power that these tools\nhave\nespecially when used\nproductively and ethically\nfor those who are wanting to teach the\nfuture generation the generation that's\nsupposed to save the world\nit's a fairly important conversation to\nhave\nwe need to be\ncreating programs creating clubs\ncreating classes creating educational\nmaterials to teach these kids not only\nabout the artificial intelligence\nsystems that will continue to be around\nin their future that they will\neventually have to create\nbut also\nto help them understand why we're what\nwe're doing wrong right now\nultimately if we can do that\nif we can do all that\nthen maybe i can forgive you for not\ngiving me my iphone 5s\nthank you\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n",
