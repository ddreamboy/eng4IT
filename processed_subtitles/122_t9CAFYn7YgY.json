  "text": "python or JavaScript which should you\nlearn let me break it down for you as\nsimply as possible ultimately what's\ngoing to determine the language you pick\ncomes down to what you want to build or\nwhat area of development you want to\nspecialize in both languages are great\nchoices but what they're best at differs\nquite a bit so let's start with what's\nthe same for both languages they're both\nbeginner friendly relatively easy to\nlearn in extreme demand and can lead you\nquite quickly into a career in Tech\neither is a great choice to start with\nand if you're already learning one I'd\nrecommend stick it out get the basics\ndown and then you can easily switch to\nanother language afterwards in fact most\ndevelopers I know including myself will\nlearn one of these languages first then\nvery quickly after learn the other one\nthey're great compliments to each other\nso if you're already learning JavaScript\nstick it out if you're already learning\npython stick it out and then later on\nyou can very quickly pick up the other\nlanguage now another thing you need to\nknow is that both of these languages are\ndynamically typed now to put it simp\nsimply what that means is they're a\nlittle bit more flexible to write code\nin but they may not be the best choice\nfor really large applications or\nanything that's performance critical but\nwhat that does mean is that learning one\nof these languages is not going to teach\nyou a drastically different set of\nfeatures than the other one so rest\nassured if you pick JavaScript almost\neverything you know is probably going to\napply to python same with python most of\nwhat you learn there is going to apply\nto JavaScript the main difference will\nbe some specific syntax features that\nyou can pick up pretty quick quickly so\npicking the wrong language is not a\nmassive mistake and at the end of the\nday you just want to get started but\nI'll give you some information that can\nhelp you make that decision so now let's\nget into the main differences keeping in\nmind what I said before that you want to\nfocus on the outcomes and the type of\nprojects you can build so with\nJavaScript you're going to be working a\nlot more on the front end it's going to\nbe a lot more Visual and you're going to\nbe able to create user interfaces make\nwebsites and immediately just make more\nVisual and interactable applications\ncompared to a language like python if\nyou're someone who wants to land a job\nand you're looking at frontend developer\npositions or full stack developer\npositions JavaScript is 100% the\nlanguage that you should be learning it\nvery quickly allows you to interact with\nHTML and CSS and by learning JavaScript\nas a product of that you're probably\ngoing to learn a bit more about HTML CSS\nand front-end web development in general\nnow to compare that with python Python's\na lot more focused on the back end and\nwith data it's really big for data\nanalysis so if you're someone who's\ninterested in AI automation machine\nlearning backend web development\nautomation tasks or scripting Python's\ngoing to be your go-to it's definitely\nnot as easy to create front-end or\nvisual applications with python however\nthe tasks that I listed it's really\nreally good at and you'll find it a\nlittle bit easier to make those type of\napplications with a language like python\ncompared to something like JavaScript\nnow at this point we definitely need to\ndiscuss Frameworks and libraries which\nkind of go hand inand with the language\nwhat you're learning when you're just\nstarting out picking either python or\nJavaScript isn't going to make a huge\ndifference the curriculum is going to be\nvery similar you're going to be learning\npretty much the same topics and the main\nthing that's going to differ is the\nsyntax and really the way in which you\nwrite code but that's something you can\nlearn pretty quickly and going between\ndifferent languages you'll very easily\npick up the differences in syntax the\nmajor differences are going to come when\nyou want to actually start building out\nlarge applications and you'll realize\nyou need to use some external tools now\nthese are typically your referred to as\nFrameworks libraries or packages they\nall have kind of a slightly different\nmeaning but in this case we'll group\nthem together now each language that I\nmentioned here Python and JavaScript\nhave a different set of very popular\nFrameworks and libraries that are used\nto create applications for example with\nJavaScript we have things like react\nview uh angular right these are really\npopular front-end web Frameworks that\nmake it really easy to build large\nscalable applications and they're\ntypically in demand as their own skill\nalongside ins JavaScript so if you want\nto be a front-end web developer you're\nprobably going to need to know something\nlike react and that means well you would\nhave had to know JavaScript right to be\nable to work with react now with python\nwe have popular Frameworks specifically\nfor data science or for automation tasks\nso things like pandas numpy scikit learn\nwe have uh natural language toolkits all\nof these types of things are really more\ningrained in Python and they don't\nnecessarily exist for JavaScript or if\nthey do they're not quite as Specialized\nor as in demand so what this leads me to\nrecommend is that if you already know\nthe type of projects you want to build\nor the jobs you might be interested in\ngo and look at the languages Frameworks\nPackages Etc that are being used for\nthose projects or that are required for\nthat job and then see the base language\nthat's required to use those specific\ntools a lot of times you'll need to know\nJavaScript as a prerequisite to learn\nthis framework or you'll need to know\npython to learn this package so that's\nwhere I would go and that's really\nwhat's going to be the major difference\nfor you the tooling you have access to\nand the type of things that you can\nbuild now with all of that said both of\nthese languages are still very general\npurpose knowing one of these languages\nallows you to build so many different\ntypes of applications and just because\nit's not the best at it doesn't mean you\ncan't do it for example you can make an\nentire website using purely python and a\nlittle bit of HTML and CSS Now is it\ngoing to be the best way to do that\nprobably not you're likely going to want\nto know some JavaScript and use that in\nyour project however you can still do it\nwith python it's possible to create user\ninterfaces it is even possible to make\nthings like mobile apps using python\nyou're just not recommended or what it's\nreally meant for now with JavaScript\nsame thing you can go and build machine\nlearning applications you can do data\nanalysis you can graph all kinds of\nnumbers but it's not going to be the\nbest with JavaScript compared to\nsomething like python where python is\nmore designed for that type of task at\nthe end of the day all programming\nlanguages are are tools to help you\nachieve something so you need to pick\nthe best tool for the job and that's why\nit's difficult when you're starting out\nto make this decision because you might\nnot even know the type of jobs that you\nwant to perform now what will mostly end\nup happening is you'll learn JavaScript\nand then you'll realize hey there's this\nthing I want to do that's kind of better\nin Python you might try to do it in\nJavaScript but at this point you're\nprobably good enough of a programmer\nthat you can go and learn a bit of\npython and you can achieve that task\nsame thing other way around you might be\nreally good at python but you want to\nimplement some frontend user interfaces\nin your application in that case you may\njust go and decide to learn a little bit\nof JavaScript exactly what you need to\nachieve that goal and this goes for all\ndifferent types of programming languages\nthat's why my advice is figure out the\ntype of things you want to build or the\ntype of jobs you want start learning\nthat first language that's most suited\ntowards kind of what you think you want\nto do and as you start learning it\nyou'll realize it's relatively easy to\ntransition into other languages and\nyou'll pick up the different tools that\nyou need for the type of jobs that\nyou're doing now at this point if you're\nstill unsure what I would encourage you\nto do is simply pick one of the\nlanguages get started learn the basics\nand then you can easily change to the\nother language if you decide that it's\nnot right for you if you're looking for\nsome resources to learn these languages\nI have all kinds of videos on my channel\nthat you can check out completely for\nfree but if you want a more premium\nresource you're a bit more serious and\nyou're really committed then I do\nactually have a software development\ncourse with course careers we've already\nhad some people graduate that course and\nland jobs quite quickly and what we do\nin there is teach you the fundamentals\nof programming and then allow you to\npick your specialization track once\nyou've gone through that so if you're\nnot sure you go through you learn all\nthe fundamentals then you can pick\nwhether you want to specialize in front\nend backend or devops and there's an\nadditional course taught by an industry\nexpert free of charge you simply pick it\nonce you graduate the fundamentals which\nis taught by me anyways you guys can\ncheck that out from the link in the\ndescription if you enjoyed the video\nmake sure you leave a like subscribe to\nthe channel and I will see you in the\nnext\n[Music]\none\n[Music]\n",
