  "text": "hi today we're going to talk about data\ngovernance now i know some of you are\nthinking this is really either boring or\nsuper complex\nbut we're going to use an analogy today\nto help drive home some of the key\nconcepts around data governance after\nall data governance is foundational and\ncritical to helping you take advantage\nof your data in the ai world\nnow recently i had the task of cleaning\nout a house as i prepared for a major\nmodernization and renovation\nthis just wasn't any ordinary house\nthough it's a house i bought from my\nparents who lived there for over 30\nyears and let's just say\nmy mom wasn't real good about throwing\naway things\nso the first thing i had to do was\nunderstand what i had so i started in\nthe basement and had to go through\nand discover\nall of the different items clothing bins\nphotographs family heirlooms\neverything that was down there\nthat process in the data world is called\ndiscovery\ndiscovery is a process of understanding\nall of the different data assets you\nhave across your repositories which may\nbe in the cloud on-prem or even from\nsome sas applications\nnow the easy part is discovering the\ndata that you know about the hard part\nis discovering the data that you don't\nknow about\nfor me\nthat was discovering all the different\nthings\nin my\nattic\nnow once i had the opportunity to go\nthrough each\ndifferent part of my house i had to\nstart classifying the items\ni had to understand if it was something\nthat was\na family heirloom whether it was a\npicture or a photograph set of\nphotographs\nor even toys financial records all kinds\nof different stuff\nin the data world the process of\nclassification is assigning data to\ndifferent categories\nwhether it's customer data product data\nfinancial data\nand providing that that label or that\nclassification to it\nnow after that this is where it gets\nreally fun in my world i had to go\nthrough and decide what to keep\nfor me i had my wife set forth some\npolicies about what we were keeping what\nwe were donating\nand what we were just throwing in the\ngarbage\nlet's take toys for example my mom loved\nto keep a lot of toys from when i was\ngrowing up\nin certain toys there were missing parts\nthe policy was\nif they were missing parts we would\ndonate them hoping that somebody may be\nable to use it if it was broken we would\nthrow it away\nnow\nwe started applying these rules\nrules are ways to help you enforce your\ndata policies and again policies are\nabout setting guidelines and standards\nabout what to do with your data in the\ndata world one policy that is very\ncommon yet critical is around personally\nidentifiable data\npersonally identifiable data such as a\nsocial security number must be masked\nthe rules help you enforce that if it is\na social security number you must mask\nit\nand that helps you enforce the policy\nnow for me\nas i went through the process\nof\nenforcing my policies i decided what i\nloved\nwhat i was throwing away\nand\nwhat i was donating\nto charity\nin the data world\nyou must go through the same process\nand as i did so in my world the things\nthat i was keeping\ni repackaged\nin bins and i labeled the different bins\ndescribing what was in each of them\nnow this is a little bit like metadata\nmetadata in the data world helps\ndescribe what that data asset is\nsimply put it's like a card catalog at a\nlibrary that describes a book it\nprovides the author the subject the\ncopyright\nin the data world it does much of the\nsame thing it tells you where the data\ncame from what it is\nso that when you want to use it it's\neasier to find and easier to use when\nthe time comes\nnow what was cool in my world was i\nfound a few things\nthat helped me\ngenerate some money\nthere were a couple of family heirlooms\nthat i didn't necessarily need anymore\nbut i was able to sell\nwouldn't that be cool like if you were\nable to monetize your data\nby understanding what it is and helping\nyour organization\nthat's the importance of data governance\nthat's the value that it brings to your\norganization\nfor me\nthe one thing i wish i could do\nwas automate that process\nthe great news for you\nin the data world you can automate it\nthanks for watching if you have any\nquestions please leave them in the\ncomments below also please remember to\nlike this video and subscribe to our\nchannel so we can continue to bring\ncontent that matters to you\n",
