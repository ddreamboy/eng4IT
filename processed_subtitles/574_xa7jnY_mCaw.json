  "text": "hi i'm victor in this video we are going\nto explore the concept of ubiquitous\ncomputing\nlet's first define the term ubiquitous\ncomputing\nis a concept of software engineering and\ncomputer science\nwhere computing is made to appear\nanytime and everywhere\nubiquitous computing can occur using any\ndevice\nin any location and in any format it is\nthe use of computers in\neveryday life this is also known as\npervasive computing\nthe terms ubiquitous and pervasive both\nmean\nexisting everywhere this is a post\ndesktop model of human computer\ninteraction\nin which information processing has been\nthoroughly integrated\ninto everyday objects and activities\nthis is the idea that almost any device\nfrom clothing to tools\nto appliances to cars to homes\ncan be embedded with chips to connect\nthe device to an infinite network of\ndevices\nit supports one user to many computing\ntasks\nand in one device with multiple\ncomputing tasks\nlike a smartphone\nthe father of ubiquitous computing is\nmark weisser\nwho was the chief scientist at xerox\npark\npalo alto research center in the u.s he\ncoined the term ubiquitous computing\naround 1988\nhe articulated the idea of ubiquitous\ncomputing\nhe stated that the highest ideal of\nubiquitous computing is to make\ncomputers so embedded\nso fitting so natural another known\npersonality in this concept\nis manual castles he suggested in his\nbook\nthe rise of the network society that\nthere is an ongoing shift from already\ndecentralized\nstandalone microcomputers and mainframes\ntowards entirely pervasive computing\nin its model of a pervasive computing\nsystem castos\nused the example of the internet as the\nstart of a pervasive computing system\nhe imagined a system where billions of\nminiature\nubiquitous interconnected devices will\nbe spread\nthe goal of ubiquitous computing is to\ncreate an environment where the\nconnectivity of devices are embedded\nin such a way that connectivity is\nunobtrusive and always available\nsuch devices characteristics may be very\ntiny\nsmall inexpensive and robust network\nprocessing\nit is either mobile or embedded in\nalmost any type of objects\nsuch as cars tools appliances\nclothing and various consumer goods all\ncommunicating through\nincreasingly interconnected networks\nhere are some examples of ubiquitous\ncomputing\ncomputer sensors in your floor that can\nmonitor your physical health\ncomputer in your car that can assist you\nwhen you drive to work\nreplacement of old electric meter with\nsmart meter\nsmart meters are tools used to manage\nand record electricity\nand performance of electronic devices in\nthe home\none of the advantages of smart meter is\nit eliminates manual monthly meter\nreadings\nautomatic intelligent lighting system\nand cooling system\nthe ubiquitous computing environment\nmight interconnect\nlighting and environmental controls with\npersonal biometric monitors\nwoven into clothing so that illumination\nand heating conditions\nin a room might be modulated\ncontinuously\nand gradually this is a smart thermostat\nit can be controlled with a phone tablet\nsmart speaker or other internet\nconnected device\nsmart thermostats typically allow you to\nschedule your desired temperature\nsettings\nand you can also incorporate them into\nhome automation systems\nrefrigerators that are aware of their\nsuitably tagged contents\nand are able to plan a variety of menus\nan interactive whiteboard it is a large\ninteractive display as a whiteboard for\neducation or business presentations\nit can either be a standalone\ntouchscreen computer used independently\nto perform tasks and operations\nor a connectable apparatus used as a\ntouch\npad to control computers from a\nprojector\nuse of rfid tags with both barcodes and\nqr codes\nit allows the consumer to connect to the\ninternet of things\nwith a simple scan of a smartphone or\ntablet\nmaking objects marked with a qr code or\nbarcode\nwould mean improving the retail\nenvironment for consumers\nbecause they will be more educated about\nthe item before purchasing and they will\nbe able to check for an item's\navailability\nlet's compare virtual reality and\nubiquitous computing\nvirtual reality puts people inside a\ncomputer-generated three-dimensional\nenvironment\non the other hand ubiquitous computing\nfocuses the computer to live out here\nin the world with people\nhere are some challenges of ubiquitous\ncomputing\nprivacy and security in a fully\nnetworked world with ubiquitous sensor\nequipped\ndevices several privacy and security\nissues may arise\nthe people in this environment will be\nworried about their privacy\nsince there is the potential of total\nmonitoring ubiquitous computing has a\nsocial impact on our society\nfor example how will an individual know\nif they are within a smart environment\nwhere embedded devices are gathering\ndata\nis it ethical to gather information from\nindividuals without their knowledge\nnext is volatility not only does the\nworld change\nbut also the set of users devices and\nsoftware components in an environment\nthey change over time with this the\ntrending device might be replaced fast\nby the technologies\nthat are to be released in the coming\ndays support for the current technology\nmay then be stopped\nthis results in incurring more expenses\nto individuals and businesses\nimpromptu interoperability this means\nmany technology producing companies\nproduce their own products\nspeaking their own proprietary language\nthis leads to non-interoperability\nbetween devices\nfrom different companies this results to\nlack of systems\nadministrations or regulations\nhere are some advantages brought to us\nby ubiquitous computing\nit processes information effectively and\nenhances effortless user experience\nit allows us to manage information\nefficiently\nit removes complexity of new technology\nsince they are designed to be used on a\nday-to-day basis\nit is designed to be integrated for\nman's use\nseamlessly or invisibly\nit allows socialization and faster\nguided decision\nmaking here are some uses of ubiquitous\ncomputing\ninformation access text or multimedia\ndocument retrieval\nlike when we are using an electronic\nbook\nthose uses can be performed through the\nhelp of the following hardware and\nsoftware technologies\nlike automatic indexing automated\nindexing is the process of assigning and\narranging index terms without human\nintervention\nthe index is produced using algorithms\nrule sets or machine learning\nnext is networking speech recognition\nwireless protocols and user sensitive\ndevices\nto end our discussion about ubiquitous\ncomputing let's discuss\nits key elements which are ubiquitous\nsensing\naccess middleware and networking\nubiquitous sensing uses a sensor it is a\ndevice that responds to a physical\nstimulus\nsuch as heat light sound pressure\nmagnetism or a particular motion and\ntransmits a resulting impulse\nas for measurement or operating a\ncontrol this gives\nsystems eyes and ears and adding more\nawareness to ubiquitous computing\nubiquitous access represents the ability\nfor a cloud service\nto be widely accessible by devices\ntransport protocols\ninterfaces and security technologies\nexample is when mobile computers\nor wearable computers access information\nnext is ubiquitous middleware it is\ntypically a software\nit shields an application from low level\ndetails that is interacting with\nubiquitous networking\nsensing and access the last key element\nis ubiquitous networking it is the\ndistribution of communications\ninfrastructure and wireless technologies\nthroughout the environment to enable\ncontinuous connectivity\nhere is an example where all these\nelements are identified\nthe floor detects user movements through\nits sensors\nwhich sends signals and are accepted by\na device with\napplication software the device sends\ndata to the cloud\nand useful or relevant information\nneeded may be returned\nthe information will then be shown to\nthe screen and effect devices\nthis next example is from the article\nentitled google's\nsmart bathroom patent put sensors in\nyour toilet\ntub and mirror by christian the looper\non\naugust 10 2016 at www.digitaltrends.com\nthe patent describes sensors in a bath\nmat that measures heart rate\nthrough the body's electrical patterns\nit has a camera in the bathroom mirror\nwhich would be able to detect things\nlike skin color variations\nit has sensors in the bathtub creating\nan ultrasonic bathtub that could perform\nan echo test\nadditional sensors may also be installed\nto detect blood pressure\nand to help keep track of the nervous\nendocrine\nand muscular systems all those data\ncould be collected\nand sent to health professionals with\nusers consent\naccording to google those collected data\ncould provide\nmuch more valuable data as it's\ncollected daily\nrather than once every few months the\npatent was filed by jeffrey rogers\nwho was director of engineering at\ngoogle when the patent was filed\nhere are the references\nthank you for watching\nplease don't forget to leave your\nfeedback please consider liking and\nsharing this video too\nagain this is victor thank you all for\nwatching\nyou\n",
