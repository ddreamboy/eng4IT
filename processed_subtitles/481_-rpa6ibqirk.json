  "text": "I recently got asked what is the top\ncyber security certification that you\nshould be pursuing this year in 2024 and\nin this video I'm going to go ahead and\nanswer that hey if you guys are new to\nthe channel my name is Nicholas Moy and\nin this channel I talk about cyber\nsecurity career advice and it career\nadvice and all that good stuff so if you\nare pursuing a career in it maybe you\ncurrently work in it but you're trying\nto transition to cyber security all\nthings like that this is the channel you\nwant to be subscribing to because I\nmyself have been working this field for\nabout 18 years now I've been the hiring\nmanager for big companies like JP Morgan\nand Chase deoe ernston young and a lot\nof big companies so I can help you uh\nkind of Skyrocket and navigate through\nall the different uh loopholes and\nsystems and pitfalls that we face as it\nprofessionals trying to transition into\ncyber security so if this is you if\nyou're stuck in a position that you feel\nunderpaid undervalued and you're not\nreally liking it you really want to move\nup you know if there's more you just\ndon't know how to get there and you're\ntrying to figure this out this is the\nchannel you want to be following so\nlet's go ahead and get into the the\nvideo for today so got a question\nrecently on one of my uh one of my\nvideos somebody dropped a comment there\nand they asked Nick what is the best\ncertification you could be pursuing um\nyou know to to build a successful career\nin cyber security all right uh and I\nmight have botched that a little bit but\nthe gist is there right what's the top\ncertification all right so here's the\nthing there is no one best magical\ngolden ticket certification that it's\nnot what it's there for I think if\nthat's the question that you're asking\nyou need to take a step back and and\nthink about what is the intention behind\na certification okay certification is\nnot a golden ticket to a job and and I\nthink a lot of people think that and\nthey study for certifications they try\nto acquire all these certifications and\nthey're they're continuing to get the\nnext certification thinking that's going\nto be the thing that gets them through\nthe door and it's not what it is what it\ncomes down to is your skills okay but\ngoing back to the idea of\ncertifications certifications are\nsomething that certify or attempt to\ncertify that you know a particular skill\nset the disconnect here\nwhich I don't think many of many people\nwithin the industry have really realized\nthat unless you've been in this industry\nfor almost two decades like I\nhave um the disconnect here is that the\ncertification exam doesn't necessarily\ntest that you know the skills and many\nof the certification exams are very\nBroad in nature and they're very uh\nvendor neutral in nature so there's not\nreally anything here to to test you on\nexcept Theory right like if I I got a\nbook over\nhere um Security Plus Security Plus\nstudy guide okay this whole entire book\nis based on Theory when you go to sit\nfor the exam about 85% of your questions\nare multiple choice questions asking you\nto identify or\nrecollect a particular technology\na particular cyber security principle a\nwhat would you do in this kind of\nsituation choose from the following\noptions it's things like that\nidentification recollection those types\nof responses when I was writing the\nquestions for the AWS certification\nexams that's exactly how they structured\nit's a multiple choice multiple\nanswer uh identify and recollect or\nrecall um the the the right answer\nthat's it okay there's nothing really to\nit um you just have to look at the the\nanswer options and choose the best\noption okay now I say 85% for the\nSecurity Plus because there's a few drag\nand drop options where you know you've\ngot like you know you've got like maybe\na a computer and and they want you to\nlike use your mouse to to hover over and\nand select the right thing right it's\nlike kind of like that drag and drop\nthing still multiple Choice it's\nstill not applicable to what we do here\nmy job I don't get paid $200,000 a year\nto go and and drag and drop stuff I get\npaid because I know the skills I get\npaid because I know the compliance\nregulations I get paid because I can\nadvise uh Business Leaders to make the\nright decisions in in cyber security\nright so when we talk about the best\ncertification it all comes down to what\nis your goal what are you trying to\naccomplish that whole thing okay when\nyou're just starting out you're trying\nto get a certification Security Plus it\nis a option it's a it's an option okay I\ndon't want to tell you that you should\nget the Security Plus and expect a job\nbecause a lot of people say that a lot\nof people go up on Tik Tok or here on\nYouTube and they'll tell you you want to\nget a job oh this right here\nthe federal government's going to be\ndrooling over you if you've got this\nSecurity Plus which is hilarious because\nthey don't and people buy this all the\ntime thinking that that's their golden\nticket or I'm going to get the CompTIA\nTrifecta like you actually did something\nit's not it's not these are just\nmultiple choice exams that are testing\nyour knowledge on you know A+ which is\nhow do you build a computer how do you\nrepair a computer network plus which is\nGeneral Network Concepts do you know\nwhat an IP is do you know what uh a CER\nblock is can you do a little\nmathematical you know uh uh I'm not a\nnetworking guy but you know you can you\ncan uh resize your network on paper okay\nwhich in real life we don't do that we\nhave calculators that do that for us um\nthat's it right it's just really testing\nyour knowledge and your awareness on\nHigh level principles within Network and\nthat's nwork plus right Security Plus\nsame thing high level principles\non Cyber SEC Concepts and you know what\na firewall is like stuff like that it's\nlike basic stuff you don't get a job by\nknowing that you get a job by knowing\nhow to implement the firewall by knowing\nhow to identify which um uh data\nregulations you need to follow for a\ninsurance company or you know what what\ncontrols you need to be selecting for\nyour cloud environment that you're\nmigrating to right it's it's it's that\nkind of thing and I apologize I have a\ncold so if I sound a little stuffy\nthat's why that's the idea okay that's\nthe idea behind those certifications\nso going back to the original question\nwhich one's the best certification to\nget all right depends on your goal if\nyou are trying to become a manager in\ncyber security the cissp is hands down\nthe best one now let me be clear if you\nhave not been working in it for 5 years\ndo not waste your time I don't care if\nyou can get the associate no one's going\nto give a damn if you've got the\nassociate of ISC Square no one cares\never I will never hire somebody because\nthey pass the\ncissp never okay I don't do\nthat um if you are trying to um if\nyou're trying to become a cloud security\nprofessional uh depending on the vendor\nyou know there's a couple good ones your\nAWS security is is a is a good exam it\ntells you or teaches you and forces you\nto understand the concepts of cloud\nnative Cloud native I'm being specific\nhere security tools within AWS so AWS\nnative security tools now what does\nnative mean that means AWS builds it AWS\nsells it it's included in the AWS\nconsole if you're an AWS user you have\naccess to it it's not a third party uh\npiece right and and the thing here the\nreason why I'm emphasizing this is\nbecause corporate you know people you\ndon't you don't know this until you're\nin it but corporations do not depend on\ncloud native security controls for\nseveral different reasons what they\ndon't always depend on it for several\ndifferent reasons reason\none uh they are multicloud and they need\nsomething that can spread across\nmultiple Cloud providers not just Amazon\nthey need they have Azure they have\nOracle they need that the spread across\neverything reason number two uh maybe\nthe tool is too expensive and they have\na cheaper option or maybe it's too\nexpensive for their need and so they are\ngoing to go with a cheaper option reason\nnumber three they've already purchased\nthe third party tool and it's sitting on\nthe shelf that's what we call shelfware\nand so now they have a need to use it\nthey're going to use it so they're not\ngoing to use the cloud native one reason\nnumber four uh could be that it's just\nit's just not good enough right reason\nnumber five it could be that it is a\ncomp it doesn't meet the compliance\nstandard that they need to meet example\nwould be fed ramp fed ramp you know it's\na new Federal Regulation for cloud\nproviders that um anyone who does\nbusiness with the government and they're\nusing the cloud uh maybe there's certain\nservices that AWS offers that's not fed\nramp High fed ramp medium compliant that\nwould be an example of that okay so when\nwe talk about Cloud security there are\ngood Cloud certifications to get okay\nthey will help you get your foot in the\ndoor that will help you understand the\nconcepts of cloud security if you're\ntrying to go for Dev SEC Ops there's not\nreally a lot out there um I do know of a\ncouple I\ndon't I I I can't I can't honestly um I\ncannot honestly uh what's the word\nwhat's the word what's the word I'm\nlooking\nfor condone it I don't I don't really\nsupport it so if you're trying to go for\nsomething Dev SEC Ops I would focus more\non the skills I would focus more on your\nskills if you're trying to go for appsc\nthere's nothing that I know of that's\ndecent that I would hire for it's not\nlike a a magic dream golden ticket okay\nso if you're trying to go for that I I\nwouldn't focus on certifications focus\non your your skills okay if you're going\nfor GRC governance risk and compliance\nuh do not focus on anything PCI DSS at\nthe moment you need to focus on your SAA\nso your cisa a which is your auditing\ncertification um over some time I would\nrecommend you go for the cism that's\nanother good one um and then let's see\nwhat else but notice here notice\nsomething I'm focusing on specialty I'm\nnot focusing on Broad generalized uh\ncertifications okay I'm not telling you\npentest plus if you want to go become a\npentester there are great certifications\nfor that the\nocp uh the pmpt those are all good\ncertifications that are Hands-On they\nteach you and they they solidify that\nyou know the knowledge is of of ethical\nhacking and penetration testing okay um\nso focusing on a role like when I'm\ntalking to you I'm telling you focus on\ncredentials that help solidify Your Role\ndon't go for the pentest plus don't go\nfor the cloud plus don't do a Security\nPlus don't do a\ncyssa plus or whatever that is from\nCompTIA don't do um you know any any of\nthose I I don't I don't recommend it cuz\nyou know if even if you did like I had\nthe Security Plus at one point if you\ngot the Security Plus cool\ngreat you'll never need to do it again\nbecause you understand the principle\nConcepts now you need to know the next\nstuff you need to know the meat and\npotatoes this right here is like taking\nyour dinner and mashing it up in a\nblender and feeding it to a baby with a\nstraw right it's it's just not stuff you\nneed it's not going to feed you it's not\ngoing to it's not going to give you what\nyou need and I guess doesn't feed you\nquite literally it does not feed you\nbecause you ain't making any money with\nthis\nthing so and if you are cool you got\nlucky but you know you're not really\ngoing to be make making big money you\nknow $100,000 $150,000 $200\n$250,000 because you got a Security Plus\nyou make that big money by focusing on\nthe role and the credentials behind it\nso that's like a what 12 minute 13\nminute video responding to your question\num but I hope this helps so couple\ntakeaways if you are looking to pursue a\ncareer in cyber security you want to get\na certification I do think that's a good\nidea there are certain certifications\nyou should be going after and uh it's\ngoing to be based on the role and your\ngoals right so the type of position you\nwant to hold that's the type of\ncertification you should be pursuing if\nif that's something that you want to\ndo\n",
