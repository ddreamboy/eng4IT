  "text": "now let's talk about or get\nunderstanding on the types of cloud\ncomputing we can categorize the\ndifferent types of cloud computing based\non two wide categories one being\ndeployment model and the other one being\nservers model let's talk about the\ndeployment model first deployment model\nis categorized into three types first\none is public and then private and then\nhybrid cloud in other words public Cloud\nprivate cloud and hybrid Cloud it'll be\neasy for me to explain and also it'll be\neasy for you to understand if I walk you\nthrough this example consider the\ndifferent types of vehicles we use to\ncommute from one place to another for\nexample if I want to travel I can pick a\nbus which is accessible to anyone I get\nin and I pay for the seat that I occupy\nand I pay for the time that I will be\ntraveling in it and I'm done cost is\nvery less here a similar kind of thing\nhappens in the public Cloud I pay only\nfor the resource that I use and I pay\nfor how long I use it if I use less I\npay less if I use more I I pay more for\nthat month simple on the other hand\nprivate cloud is like buying your own\ncar and using it for commuting purpose\nhere I pay a huge amount UPF front and\nit is all owned only by me I do not pay\nfor it in an odly fashion but completely\nand all upfront the cost here is very\nhuge and thirdly if I want the best of\nboth types like the comfort of the own\ncar and still don't want to pay all UPF\nfront otherwise want only to pay for the\ntime that I use the service I can rent a\ncar similarly I can have it in a hybrid\nenvironment meaning if I already have a\nDC I can integrated it with the cloud\nand use both the DCS and that would\nbecome an hybrid environment all right\nso that was good of an uh learning let's\nsummarize the types of cloud based on\ndeployment models and as we know now\nabout the public Cloud public cloud is\nan Cloud infrastructure that's made\navailable to the general public over the\ninternet and it is owned by the cloud\nprovider some of the major players as\nCloud providers are AWS Microsoft Azure\nIBM's blue cloud and suncloud and\nprivate Cloud now this Cloud\ninfrastructure is exclusively operated\nby a single organization it can be\nmanaged by organizations or third party\nand may exist on premises or off\npremises doesn't matter but the point\nhere is this is exclusively operated for\na single organization and some companies\nthat provide private cloud are AWS and\nVMware and hybrid Cloud gives the best\nof both public and the private Cloud for\nexample the federal agencies they opt\nfor private clouds for storing and\ndeveloping personal data and they use\npublic Cloud to share the non-sensitive\ndata with the general public or with\nother government departments now let's\ntalk about different clouds based on the\nservice model if we need to categorize\nthem broadly we can categorize them as\ninfrastructure as a service I s or\nplatform as a service P or software as a\nservice s they sometimes are referred to\nas is p and SAS now at this moment you\ncould be like this guy thinking Sam I\nthought you're done categorizing the\ncloud now you're going to talk about\nthree more categories which one should I\npick well let me explain if all that you\nwant is just an Wim and you have all the\nexpertise to install the software on top\nof it and make it work then go for is if\nyou only want a platform or an interface\nto program or an interface to upload a\nprogram and make it run then pick pass\nor if all that you want is a finished\nproduct hosted in the cloud and be able\nto access it through the internet then\ngo for SAS here you get a username and\npassword for an application and you can\nbegin to customize the application based\non your needs all right let's talk about\num IAS in a bit more detail I it gives\nbasic Computing infra it's based on uh\npay for what you use model and some of\nthe cloud providers who are big players\nare AWS Azure and Google and here the\nusers generally will be it admins in\npass the provider gives you a platform\nor a runtime environment for developing\ntesting and managing application it's\nplatform ready you buy the platform you\nupload your code and you start working\non it and it allows the software\ndevelopers to deploy applications\nwithout running the underlying\ninfrastructure and as you might have\nguessed by now the interesting\ncandidates who would use Pas is software\ndevelopers and in SAS everything is\nmanaged by the vendor be it the hardware\nor the software it's managed by the\nvendor and we pay for the service and we\npay for it through a pay as youo\nsubscription model and as you might have\nguessed the end users here would be End\ncustomer itself all right let's put\ntogether everything in the same page and\ncompare and contrast the different types\nof service models in this chart it\nexplains the difference between the four\nmodels starting from on premises to I as\nand then pass and S it is\nself-explanatory that the resources\nmanaged by us are huge in on premises\nand little less in is and further less\nor reduced in p and nothing to manage\nwhen it comes to SAS let me also explain\nthe different types of cloud services\nthrough an example like this let's say\nthat you have a crush on cake and you're\nplanning to bake one yourself now let's\nlook at the options you can have you can\nmake all the ingredients yourself be the\nfloor uh butter and uh you know put\ntogether and bake the whole thing\nyourself using your own oven pan you\nknow the needed water and the rest you\nget an idea right everything is yours\nand that's on premises all that you use\nis owned by you and nothing is managed\nby the vendor the other options you can\nhave is buy the ingredients and mix and\nbake the cake yourself now this would be\nlike I ass here the infra is managed by\nthe provider and we get to use it and\ncustomize it the way we want it here the\ncloud service isn't share responsibility\nthe other options you still have on hand\nis simply pick a phone and order a cake\nnow this is lot simpler than the rest we\ndiscussed so far you know it's simply\npicking the phone and ordering the cake\nand pay for it when it arrives simple\nand when it reaches home you will have\nto arrange the table garnish the cake if\nthat's needed and then enjoy the cake\nit's the same way with pass just get the\nplatform in which you would run your\ncode and upload your code and start\nrunning your application here you and\nthe vendor still share the\nresponsibility you still have one more\noption left that is simply go out and\ndine this is a lot lot simpler that it\nrequires no effort from us at all you\nbuy the fully finished and garnished\ncake and pay for it and walk out no\nresponsibility on making the cake it's\nthe same way with SAS we buy the\nfinished product product and pay for the\nfinished application I really hope you\nenjoy this video I'll meet you in the\nnext video thank\nyou hi there if you like this video\nsubscribe to the simply learn
