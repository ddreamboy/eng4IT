  "text": "so good afternoon everyone my name is\nGerry Ryder and it's my pleasure to host\nthis webinar today now on to our speaker\ntoday for those that weren't with us\nfurther previous webinar in this in this\nseries our speaker is Martin Schweitzer\nwho is a data technologist with Ann's in\nour Melbourne office Martin has a\nbackground in computer science and a\nparticular interest in visualization\ndata science and user interface design\nhe has a very professional background\nwhich includes photography working on\nlarge IT systems lecturing as well as\nrunning workshops and training courses\nmartin is currently seconded to Ann's\nfrom the Bureau of Meteorology\nwhere he is largely responsible for the\nclimate record of Australia today Martin\nis presenting the second in the series\nof two webinars on data visualization\nand today's focus will be on tools and\ntechniques so without any further ado\nI'll hand over to you Martin thanks\nJerry and thanks Suzanna is behind the\ncontrols I hope everybody can see my\nscreen so today we're going to look at\ncreating visualizations and pretty much\neverything you see is going to be live\nI'm using a tool called Jupiter notebook\nyou don't have to be familiar with this\ntool to follow along also be using\nPython for my examples but if you don't\nknow Python once again that shouldn't be\na problem because most of the tools and\ntechniques that have will be shown you\nwill be available in other languages\nwith example R and the languages like\nthat so I'll be going through a number\nof libraries and generally the strengths\nof each library where there can be used\nhow they can be used and as we\nprogressed progress will move from more\nstatic to more web-based type\nenvironments so chip the notebook runs\nin a web browser and so what you see\nhere is my web browser and I'll just max\nat winnards web browser and what it\nallows us to do is to type in Python\ncode and then executed immediately and\nthis is great for anybody doing research\nbecause a lot of the work is in\nexperimenting you try something you\nadjust a few parameters and so on the\nfirst two lines I've got is just to set\nup our environment and it's often we get\nerror messages showing so this will just\nhide them some of the lobbies we'll be\nexploring today\nthe first one is matplotlib I will be\nlooking at pandas one called Seabourn a\n- web-based called bouquet and pluckley\nand the last one is one that's used for\nmapping called base map and as I go into\neach one we'll talk about them in detail\nnow if anybody missed the first talk\nthat's not a problem because I'll\nexplain things as I go along but a\nnumber of these examples are showing how\nwe created the plots that you may have\nseen in the first talk also one of the\nthings I said in the first talk was when\ndoing any sort of visualization it's\nimportant to have some sort of story or\nsome sort of reason or something we're\ntrying to say with their visualizations\nso the first visualization I'm going to\nshow is actually based on a problem that\nI came across just while browsing the\nweb and I'll explain the problem\nbasically we have a room there are 50\npeople in the room and each person\nstarts with $100 each time the clock\nticks each person takes a random number\nyeah pics are called between 1 and 50\nand let's say their code says point 4 6\nthey'll give $1 to person 26 if they've\ngot someone in their hand if they've got\nno money at that point in time they\ndon't give anything so the question was\nafter a few thousand takes less a\nthousand how much money how will the\nmoney be distributed will it be fairly\nevenly distributed among the people will\nsome people have a lot of money and some\npeople a little and so on so I found\nthis quite interesting I wrote as small\nsimulation the first part of this code\nis the simulation so all that is\nsimulating\nwhat happens and I'm now using the lab\nrecalled Mack front lip matplotlib is as\nmuch as you can say there's a standard\nprotein library in Python the standard\nplotting library and in macro clip to\nplot my results that are got requires\none line so to run this I just press I'm\ngoing to press ctrl return and if\neverything works as it hope it will we\nget a plot so this one line of code gave\nme a plot it realized that there were\n50/50 elements and it taught and that\nthey values inside those elements were\nbetween 0 and 350 however this plot\ndoesn't really give us a picture of\nwhat's happened so what I'm going to do\nis sort it so that the people with the\nleast money come up first and the people\nwith the most money come last and so as\nI said this is an interactive\nenvironment so all after it is press and\nmake that change\npress shift enter again it runs it a\nthousand times now get a very different\nplot and yeah we can see that a lot of\npeople have beloved 50 dollars most of\nthem have below a hundred dollars and\nthey're very few people have between 250\nand 350 dollars so one of the things you\nwill notice yet I'll just change this\nonce again and now what I'm going to do\nis to save the plot as an SVG SVG is\nscalable vector graphics and I'll run\nthe plot again it will save it and I can\nnow open it in a web page so just a\npager and what we see is we've got a\nnice plot and the other thing about it\nthat's special about scalable vector\ngraphics is that it's scalable if I'm\nmake it bigger because it's a vector we\ndon't get any artifacts it just scales\nit gets bigger it gets smaller we don't\nlose any quality the next thing is we\ncan look at this and say well this sort\nof looks exponential how well does\nan exponential curve and so once again\nmatplotlib\nallows us to do this we're not going to\nrerun the simulation we'll just choose\nthe data from the last simulation and\nwhen we run it what we see is we get a\nnice little so what I've done is I said\nadded a LAN a polynomial of third degree\nthat fits those points and I've just\nnoticed that I haven't reset something\nfrom the last time I ran it some quickly\ndon't restart this and have to rerun the\nsimulation unfortunately and when we do\nthis again okay which is what I expected\nan orange line so initially what we see\nis we've got this thin orange line which\nnicely fits the points and by changing\nthe Patrick and said things like the\nline width equals fine run it again and\nwe get a thick orange line which is much\neasier to see but it's crossing over the\npoints so the next thing we can do is\njust say alpha which is the transparency\nso equals 0.5 which basically says make\nit 50% transparent and now we get a nice\nthick transparent line running through\nthose points so once again matplotlib\ngives us the ability to customize this\nline if we wanted X's instead of circles\nwe can change the plot of the points to\nX's and run again and we get X's so one\nof the characteristics that we often\nlook for when looking for a library is\nthis idea that simple things should be\nsimple complex things should be possible\nin other words we don't want a very long\nlearning curve we'll have to do a lot of\nwork to get a simple graph but if we do\nwant something special we want to be\nable to do it we don't want it tool\nthat's really simple to use but as soon\nas we want something a little bit out of\nthe ordinary sunny of the tool stops\nworking so we'll look at a few more\nexamples of metrically this one actually\ncomes from the documentation and easiest\nthing is to show it if\nlots of Cola broth it's using different\ncolors and we've just in this case\ngenerated some random numbers and make\nthem the size of the circle and\ngenerated a random number for where\naround the circle we've got at it and\nthen depending on the end of we plotting\nthe numbers in a different color\nonce again the code that's doing the\nplotting of those two lines once we've\ngenerated the data all we need our two\nlines of code and it gives us a really\nnice polar plot and yes another example\nonce again also from the documentation\nwhat we're doing with this one is we're\ngoing to display it interactively in\ncipta notebook but we're also going to\nsay that this time we're going to save\nit as a PDF so let's run this and there\nwe get four histograms it's the same\ndata each time but what it's\ndemonstrating dress is different ways in\nwhich we can create histograms so we can\nhave stacked we can have unfilled we can\nhave bars with legends etc and if we\nhave a look at the PDF that we've\ngenerated they were going once again\nbecause it's a PDF it's scalable and as\nwe scale we don't lose any quality it\njust is all done with vectors and gives\nus really nice output and and where\nthat's useful is if we're doing any kind\nof publication it's really nice to be\nable to save output either as SVG or PDF\nand include that in a publication this\nis one more showing the range of plots\nwe can do and this one is called a hex\npin plot so it's plotting with hexagons\nand\nwhat we're doing is it's kind of a cross\nbetween a scatterplot which cuts X\nvalues and Y values on a graph where\nwe've got like we may have the X values\nmaybe harmony\nthink somebody is eaten and the Y values\nmaybe something like the weight and we\nwant but those two against each other\nbut what this is also doing is plotting\nit against how frequently those values\noccur and we one of the nice things is\nit's really easy to do log scales what\nwe see is a nice graph showing us that\nthat white area in the center of values\nthat occur very often and as we move our\nvalues occurring less and less often the\nfollowing one is we've actually what\nwe're going to do is quickly look at a\ncomic some people may be familiar with\nthe web comic called xkcd the person\nrandall munroe\nis a very funny person but with quite a\nscientific bent and also quite strong\ncomputer skills this one is called stove\nownership and it shows his health before\nhe realized he could cook bacon whenever\nhe wanted and afterwards the thing about\nthis graph is that it's hand drawn and\nwhile sometimes we want graphs that look\nvery polished very professional there's\noften a perception when people see a\ngraph like that that the figures are\nvery accurate and this isn't was the\ncase so what people did was to create a\nstyle using McLaughlin that would\nrecreate the look and feel of the xkcd\nand this is quite long because there's\nquite a lot in fact they've taken two of\nthese comics and I'll quickly\nprop that using metric Lib and what we\nsee is a computer-generated reproduction\nof Randall Martinez\nwell if that's the one of his this is a\nhistogram in done in very much the same\nstyle which cut is another one of his\ncomics so taking the style I will read\nplot my simulation you'll remember the\nresults from my simulation so if we run\nthat again we see we get this thing and\nwhich once again so now that it doesn't\nlook slick and professional we see\nreally this is very much a simulation at\nthese figures aren't accurate and so on\nwhat this does do for us is it does give\nus an idea of the flexibility of\nmatplotlib so quickly restart the kernel\nbefore going into our next library and\nthe next library is called pandas pandas\nis a very useful library for anybody\nwho's working with spreadsheets who's\nworking with CSV files who's working\nwith data that's coming from an API\nacross the web and it also has its own\nplotting routines built in so in this\ncode year the first line which actually\ngoes over three lines\nI'm reading a file which is danced or\nreach levels it's a CSV file anybody who\nwatched the last presentation would be\nfamiliar that I showed some examples\nyou'll see the same examples again today\nso the first line reads the file the\nsecond line plots it using pandas\nplotting and the third line just adds a\nlegend to all sets at the label of the\nfarm\npercent fool so we'll run this code and\nthen we could get these our Melbourne\ngems and this is showing that the\nThompson is about 68 percent full and\nthings like turaga are 95% full so what\nwe've done is in one line we've read\nthat CSV file we've called it what we\nwant to call it columns one of the\ncolumns is called name and one of the\ncolumns is called P full for percentage\nfull and when we thought it\nbecause pandas knows about this thing\ncalled the earth or we have to say I\nwant to plot the name against the\npercentage fool and I want to bar chart\nand the voice has said I want to plot\nfrom the value sixty to a hundred so if\nI leave out those values but the same\ngraph it will plot from zero to a\nhundred body faults or just this one and\npart of the thing was to show that even\nthough we've got the same figures in the\nsame graph it looks different when we\nstart our scale from zero so once again\nthe Thompson is about 68 percent full\nand turaga is almost hundred percent\nfull the the point the take home point\nhere is that to create that plot took\ntwo lands of code and the third thing\nthat we showed last time was what's\nreally interesting there is the gap in\nvolume of these different dams and that\ngives us a much better picture of what's\nhappening so when we run that what we\nsee is because the Thompson dam is a\nreally big dam it's got over 200,000\ngigalitres of water deficit so even\nthose even though these dams on the\nright are almost full altogether they\ndon't even make up that deficit in the\ndam\nso that's matplotlib and its strength is\nthat it can pretty much come standard\nwith Python it's flexible and so on\nhowever its simplicity often comes at\nthe cost that it's not the best\npublication ready graphing tool you can\nget very nice publication ready graphs\nby doing a bit of work but what some\npeople have done is to do that work to\nmake it easier for people to create\nbetter graphs so one of those libraries\nis called Seaborn and Seaborn basically\nsits on top of matplotlib and simply\nadds some nice tiles so will reap lot\nthat same plot this time using Seaborn\nand all that all that we do\nis importing it and just saying and\ninitializing it so we've just added\nthose two lines everything else is\nexactly as the last example and we run\nthis and we see a totally well similar\ngraph but different styling and what\nSeabourn has done is to make it quite\neasy to change the styling so I'll say\nset the style to white run it again and\nwe see we get a nice clean graph and for\nexample in the next example what we will\ndo is we'll set the status tile but we\nwant to white grid and a muted palette\nand we will run that one and we get that\nwhite grid with a muted palette okay\nthe next twenty is just one of the well\none thing that's he ponders which a few\npackages are starting to do is that it\nactually includes its own datasets when\nyou install the package which is really\ngreat for when you're learning because\none of the worst things is you pick up a\npackage you can learn it but the first\nthing you've got it is find some data to\npretend so on\none of the data sets that c1 comes with\nis this one called flights and I really\nenjoy heat maps so this is just an\nexample of really simple he using\nSeaborn and some of its inbuilt data or\nsome of the data is provided and what we\nsee are VA is these going down the\nbottom are years across the y-axis or\nmonths and so roundabout 1960 July there\nwere lots of flights and the sort of in\nthe earlier years I guess there were\nfewer flights also during winter there\nfewer flights then in summer once again\ndone with Seaborn and done really with\ntwo three two lines of text to lines of\ncode which are those lines another data\nset that comes with Seaborn\nis called tubes and it's basically how\nmuch people would at restaurants so the\nfirst thing we'll do is to load the data\nset\nhave a look at the first ten rows of\nthis dataset so what we see is we've got\na few columns the first one is the\namount of the total bill how much tip\nwhat tip was left the sex of the person\nserving whether or not there were smoker\nwhat day of the week it was whether it\nwas lunch or dinner and the size of the\nparty so we're going to use that data\nset and have a look at a few Seabourn\ngraphs first one we're going to look at\nis a box plot and what we've done is\nwe've said we want for you to be whether\nthey smoke or not so the purplish color\nmeans there were smokers the greenish\ncolor means there weren't on the left\nhand side we've got the size of the\ntotal bill and across the bottom is day\nso it does seem that on Sundays maybe\npeople tip more and it would look like\non Sundays maybe for some reason\nwhatever smokers took more than\nnon-smokers another plot that is often\nused in similar ways to the box plot but\ncarries a bit more information in codes\na bit more information is what's known\nas a violent plant and these ones are\nquite easy in Seabourn and in this case\nwhat we've done is we've used a\ndifferent view for male and female and\nso basically you read this pretty much\nthe same as the box but there's the\nmedian there's one the top quarter of\nthe bottom quartile etc and some of the\ninformation is very much the same on\nSundays people seem to tip the most and\nwe concede they've been splitting this\ntime into male and female those people\nwho have the last one will remember I\ndemonstrated something called and scums\nquartet it's four data sets each with\nthe same means and linear regression\nlines but each data set looks very\ndifferent here's a very simple example\nof it being done in Seabourn we'll just\nhave a quick look at that and we see it\nwas quite\nsee in this case we sharing the y-axis\nacross the bottom we share in the x-axis\nof the two plots and all of this was\ndone in a very very compact way using\nSeaborn the next thing we're going to\nlook at is plotting data on maps and\nthis is goes back to a lot of what I do\nin my substantive job at the bureau so\nthe library that we use for a lot of our\nmapping is once again it's a standard\nwith Python it's called base map and the\nfirst one we're not actually plotting\nanything we just simply drawing a map\nand so it takes a little bit the first\ntime we run it but we've plotted a map\nof the world in a few lines of code it's\npretty much from there to there so the\nstory we also what we're really\ninterested in at this stage is Australia\nand this projection isn't as useful as\nwhat we're going to look at now which is\nthe sort of McKay turn so we'll just\nchange some of the parameters and this\nshould give us a map of Australia which\nis great looks a bit like the ones I\ndraw by hand so what I'm going to\ndemonstrate now is some more\nvisualization but it goes back to a\nproblem I was given about a year or two\nago so we haven't about a hundred and\ntwelve reference stations around\nAustralia and these are stations with a\nvery high quality data that have a long\nrecord about fifty years or longer and\nthese are very important in as reference\nstation is to see what's happening with\nthe climate of Australia and one of the\noutcomes of this the reference station\nset is called acorn and we do a\npublication where we publish the names\nof each station and one of the things we\nalso publish is for each session which\nare the closest relations to that\nstation so I wrote some code that worked\nout what the closest three stations were\nto each station this was\nFowler was given if once again I'm using\npandas to read it and so we've got for\nexample all squeak we've got the\nlatitude longitude the altitude and the\ndate it was opened as we can see these\nall have a very long record and so the\nfirst thing I let's plot these are using\nmatplotlib the first part we've seen\nthat grows the map this line after\nhaving read the file plots the date on\nthe maps that will just quickly prop\nthose stations so the black dots of\ncourse are the stations and they're 112\nof them around Australia so the question\nI was asked is after saying ok as a list\nfor each station these are the closest 3\nsessions to that particular station\nbeing scientists that was asking for\nsome questions they said but going to\none of the closest three stations from\neach station is it possible to get from\nany station to any other station now it\nmay seem that the obvious answer is yes\nbut the thing is because if I'm sitting\nyearn these may be my three closest\nstations but that does not mean that\nwhere I'm sitting which is around\nwithout maketh or that it's going to be\none of the closest three stations to\nthis station because this stations three\nclosest neighbors or maybe these three\nstations so the first thing I did\nbecause fill official was to try and\nvisualize it and what I did was to go\nback to a very old package which is but\nthat he is older I first used it\nprobably more than 20 years ago called\nbroth base and Python includes bindings\nfor graph is so we can think of this as\neach station is a node and we've got\nlines connecting it to the three closest\nstations so what I've done is to do\nsomething that will visualize that and\nso we will just run this current and it\ncreates a PDF and what we see in this\nPDF is that I've simply use the station\nnumbers to save space we can see the\nlayout of all the stations and move the\nquestion we\none of the things that we see for\nexample is that stations 7:05 even\nthough it's got three stations that are\nclosest to it\nthere's no station for which 7 0 4 5 is\nthe closest station and we can see it in\na few other places as well I think over\nyeah we've only got one line going from\n85 and 969 1 2 9 3 if anybody wants to\nguess this part is in fact these\nstations that are in Tasmania and if we\ngo back to a graph that we can see how\nthese are all close together that\nstation is close to that one but these\nare all closer to each other then the\nmain one so basically that graph helped\nus visualize and yes it turns out after\nwriting some code that there is no\nsingle path so the next question once\nagain these people being scientists is\nwhere would we have to add stations so\nthat the closest selected there's always\na way that we can get to another station\nby visiting one of the closest three so\nI came up with a new visualization and\nit's called a Voronoi plot and I'll run\nthis code and what a Voronoi cut does is\nit's not easy to show you a chart in a\nwebpage that I did so on this map you\nsee the a concept stations and you see\nall these polygons and what these\npolygons are every point inside this\npolygon for example is closer to this\nstation than to any other station that's\nnot inside the polygon so any point\ninside this polygon this point for\nexample is closer to there than it is to\nany of the surrounding stations\nso basically active adds that Erik react\nin two areas and we in a way saying ok\nwill the temperature there we could\nargue smile\ninfluenced by this station so if we've\ngot a temperature you and want to check\nit for accuracy or whatever we're more\nlikely to look here than one of these\nother stations but so what does this\nhave to do with where do we build a site\nwell if we consider this line the in any\npoint along this line is the point\nthat's the furthest point between this\nstation and the station and any point on\nthis line is the point that's the\nfurthest one between that station in\nthat station therefore if we were going\nto so any point on one of these edges\nyet is where these lines meet is that\npoint that's the furthest from all the\nadjoining stations so this point is\nfurthest from that one that one and that\none and obviously further than any other\nso what it comes down to is if we're\ngoing to build a new station we want it\non one of these points on one of these\nvertices so it's just another example of\nhow we can use visualizations to solve\nsome real problems so for the moment\nthat's all we're going to do with maps\nand we may return to it soon the next\nlibrary we're going to quickly have a\nlook at is called bouquet and bouquets\nthe first library it works with patent\nbut its output is targeted generally at\nwebpages so once again you remember an\nscums put it from a previous slide we'll\ndo it in bouquet and it's given us a\nreally nice graph of pens combs quartet\nand if one sees some of the original\ndrawings of it for example in toughness\nbut this is very close to the original\nso it was very easy to book it required\nsome work to make it look similar but we\ncould it was flexible enough that we\ncould I'll quickly show another one\nwhich is another famous machine learning\ndata set which is our\nand this one is plotting so what we're\nplotting is the petal width of different\nspecies against the petal length and we\nsee that some species are down yeah\nsome species the green ones are yeah and\nsome of you\nthe thing about bouquet is it allows us\nsome interactivity so we can do things\nlike zoom we can also pan and if we put\nthe output on a web page the web page\ncan have these same tools there's a\nwheel zoom we can go back to what it\nlooked like initially so that's quite\nokay and yes one that also came from\nthat last one called joy plots and the\nthing about this is we plotting a whole\nlot of variables against a common set of\naxes well just for the moment skippable\nplot lean because I want to look at a\nfew tools that are useful in web\ndevelopment so we live in - for a moment\nand the first one is one that I read a\nfew years ago so this is using Google\nMaps and I'm putting some date on it and\nthese are the icon set stations once\nagain and when we click on one we get a\ngraph of the climatology the average\nmonthly temperature so we're now in\nApril so the average maximum temperature\nfor Melbourne is normally 21 degrees\nthis is their average rainfall for\nMelbourne around 50mm we can also get\ntime series and we can zoom in on the\ntime series so this graph and the time\nseries were done using a tool called\nhigh charts pie charts is available free\nfor non-commercial use but it does\nrequire lessons for any kind of\ncommercial years and government this is\nalso considered commercial having said\nthat if you are doing webpages and you\nare looking for protein package it's\nworth considering heart charts and the\nnext example\nis another mapping library\nthis one is leaflet in this case this is\nsomething I did for work what we plot in\nhere is this data is coming from\nnetcdf and some people will be familiar\nand I've used netcdf and the data is\ncoming straight out of these netcdf\nfiles so we can the main purpose of this\nslide there is to show this library\nleaflet which basically allows us to put\ndate on top of maps in this case with\nits gridded data but we can also put the\nyeah we've got some geo jason we could\nalso be putting shape files and other\nthings there's things like utility\nboundaries which you can overlay on the\nmap so it basically allows us to overlay\nd8 on top of maps the third example I'll\nshow is one called\nopen layers and this was one of the more\ncomplex visualizations I did basically\nwhat this one is demonstrating is East\nCoast lows of the eastern seaboard of\nAustralia and all of this was overlaid\non this map using the map was done with\nopen layers so I think that's all I'll\ntalk about and I think finally what\nwe'll do is look at one more library and\none more example so the library we're\ngoing to look at is called Vega and once\nagain it's another simulation I came\nacross this thing called charondas\nparadox and for me it was quite\nmind-blowing so I just had to do that\nvisualization to make sure that I\nunderstood it and that it work so\nbasically I'll try and explain it\nquickly you've got three games you can\nplay and each of them involves a coin\nbeing spun and in game one the coin is\nmore likely to land on tails and so\neach time in Game one you bet on its in\nother words it's a losing strategy\nso that's game 1 in game 2 we\noccasionally choose coin 1 oh sorry\nwe've got coin to which most often lands\non heads but we don't choose coin 2 all\nthe time it just sorry we don't choose\nheads all the time\nsometimes we choose heads sometimes we\nchoose tails and most of the times we\nchoose heads but two or three times we\nchoose tails and it can be shown once\nagain the better losing strategy in game\n3 what we do is we randomly decide to\neither play game 1 again - so if game\none we definitely lose again - we\ndefinitely lose we would think that\nchoosing game 1 and game 2 we should\nalso lose if we just choose randomly\nbetween whether to play again 1 or game\n2 so in this one I've used the slab\nrecalled vaguer and I think the first\nthing I'll do is just run so I play this\ngame 10,000 times I play game a and plot\nthe results I play again be 10,000 times\nblood the result and then up I do p3\nwhich is where I randomly choose between\ngame 1 and game 2 and plug the results\nwe run the simulation p1 is when I play\ngame 1 and we can see I started off with\n$0 end up with minus $100 when I played\ngame 2 which was also a losing strategy\nI did actually quite badly I ended up\nwith minus 250 dollars but when I\nalternated randomly between the two\ngames I landed up in the black with plus\n150 so this adds or this - notebook will\nbe included after the talk are you\nwelcome to have a look at this and find\nthe mathematical explanation why it\nworks or you can also just google around\nthose paradox so what have we found out\nwell I guess one of the questions is if\nI want to do visualizations what's a\ngood tool so in brief matplotlib is a\ngood one to start with easy things are\neasy\nflexible things are possible it can do\ndozens of different visualizations it's\nvery good for static plots in other\nwords if you're going to publish your\nresults in a book or whatever and it\nalso integrates well with pythons maths\nand science toolkits it's and this if\nyou're familiar with math and it\nunderstands things like vampires on time\nand they're all tightly integrated\nSeabourn makes it easier to do let's say\npublication ready plots with meant plot\nlive\nbouquet has very nice output it targets\nwebpages it's got a slightly easier\nlearning curve in my plot lib and it\nlooks good out of the box partly one of\nthe things is it's based on a commercial\npackage and there's both commercial and\nnon-commercial versions of it available\nit leverages d3 for graphics d3 is a\nfantastic JavaScript graphics library\nthat unfortunately the stroke didn't\ngive us time for and because of that the\ninteraction is more extensive than\nbouquet and also the range of things one\nthing I didn't talk about a PD Vega or\nvery girl is that it's got a investment\nway of working in that it defines a\nlanguage for defining the graph and it\ndisplays it but when you create a graph\nwith Vega that graph includes all the\ndata that was used to create the graph\nso if you interested in making your\npublications in your data available so\nit's one thing to get see a graph in a\npaper and say okay well how do i\nreproduce this graph it's another thing\nto say okay this is the graph and this\nis all the data they've created this\ngraph so it's really worth considering\nif it's important to you to publish the\ndata with the graphs basemap is based on\nmatplotlib it sits on top of matplotlib\nit can be a bit clunky but it does the\njob\nCarter PI is still I don't think I\nhundred percent product\nI'm ready but it improves on basement\nmakes it easier to use and some great\nfeatures and then I'll quickly go\nthrough leaflet its advantages were that\nwait it's quick to learn and use and\nsupports many formats most particularly\nWMS and geo Jason openlayers\nis more feature well than leaflet it\nused to be a steeper learning curve than\nleaflet but modern what versions are\nactually much easier or they've improved\nthe learning they've made the learning\ncurve less steep I didn't get a chance\nto demonstrate caesium but it can\nutilize built-in 3G capabilities of\nbrowsers and it works just out of the\nbox you can install it and immediately\nyou've got a map up and running I\ninstalled it recently just ripped right\nout and about an hour later I decided to\ndownload some earthquake data from the\nUnited States geographical survey and\nwithin about 15 minutes I was displaying\nthat data on my Mac so it makes it\nreally easy what are my recommendations\nif you work with Python and you not\ninterested in learning a lot of\nprogramming and getting deeply into it\nbut you do need to work with data and\nyou're doing research I recommend learn\npandas use pandas for protecting for\nstatic parts and use Vega for the web\nthanks very much well thank you so much\nMartin for such an informative and\npractical presentation and bravely with\nso many live demos which we rarely see\nso thank you for that now we do have\ntime for questions so if people have\nquestions or comments please put them\ninto the question pod now is your chance\nwith the Martin online to ask any\nspecific questions about packages or\njust some of the things that you've seen\ntoday so please and\nto ask away we have got time for a few\nquestions\nso Martin we do have a question from\nMarlon what's your opinion on tools like\nto blow or to blue ta baa you two people\nhave asked about that one\nso tableau is what's known as a bi tool\nor business intelligence tool it's used\nin the bureau it's a commercial tool I\nthink I'm correct in saying that it's\nonly commercial there may be demo\nversions available from everything I\nunderstand it does what it's designed to\ndo extremely well and it so it's very\ngood at building dashboards I think it\noften assumes the idea that there's\ngoing to be a data warehouse available\nor at least the data Mart I know\nprevious versions work was used there\nwere some issues with creating websites\nthat were being presented to the public\nthis was because it wasn't wicked\ncompliant you know that wicker gives the\nweb accessibility guidelines and for\ngovernment work websites need to be\nweek' compliant it had some mapping\nfeatures but the maps only a large\nsingle layers which would have made\nsomething like what I demonstrated with\nthe rainfall maps very tricky because we\nwe had sometimes up to five or six\ndifferent layers on those maps so I\nguess I another one you sort of\nrecommend or there's many packages but I\nthink from everything I understand and\nI'm not a regular tableau user but it\nworks well for its design purpose and\none of the areas where no people have\nreally enjoyed using it is where they've\nwanted management app dashboards on\ntheir desktop to be able to monitor\nwhatever it was that they were\nmonitoring it thanks Matt in an end\nJohn has popped into the question pod\nthat there is a free public version\nof tableau to blue I get my mouth around\nit so if people are interested they\ncould go and check that out for\nthemselves\nCollins Aston Martin why Python and not\nRuby and he also has asked if met web or\nour make the grade\nokay a reason - and not prove is because\nI know Python and they don't know Ruby\nparticularly well when Ruby came out I\nstarted learning it and then other\nthings got in the way I don't think\nthere's any good reason why not Ruby but\nI can't talk with authority on harmony I\nthink one of the things is with data\nscience - and I really seem to have\ntaken a lot of that man chair between\ncontinent are I wouldn't it's six of one\nhalf a dozen of that there there are a\nlot of people using are there lot of\ndomains where people really love our\nbioinformatics and those one with very\ncommon every and as I said in the\nbeginning most of these visualizations\nin that are available enormous any\nlanguage that people look at or any\npopular language when people come up\nwith a library lamp ugly though other\npeople will create bindings for\ndifferent languages thanks Matt another\nquestion do you use other mapping tools\nlike arcmap that's another question from\nMarlon well at the bureau\nESRI products are very popular I\npersonally don't use off map and\nprobably just because of the nature of\nthe work that I'm doing and probably\nbecause of the current set of tool chain\nthat we've got I do use an open-source\nproduct called huges occasionally but\neven that I don't use often so most of\nmy work is done in the well of this time\nis done it using things got JavaScript\nand so I just used the JavaScript\nlibraries that over\nokay and a question from Susan who's\ninterested in a online tutorial for\nbeginners in data visualization so apart\nfrom recordings of your own webinars\nMartin is there any anything that you\ncould recommend to Susan that might you\nwant to take on notice I think it is a\nno definitely of a look but there's a\nlot of MOOCs\nso my go-to places are things like\nUdacity or EDX and likely I've been\nnoticing particularly with sort of the\ncurrent flavor of the month being\ndatasets a lot of these places are\noffering courses but yeah certainly\nI'll have a look at maybe we'll put a in\none of our snippets or something okay\nThank You Martin and that's probably a\nnice segue to to plug our updated web\npage now we Martin's kindly spent some\ntime updating the content of our web\npage on the ends website and I'm just\nshowing you the link here so a lot of\nthe tools and the libraries that\nMartin's spoken about in the webinars\nare available and described there so\nplease go and have a look at that and\nalso of course these webinar recordings\nwill be made available we have one last\nquestion Martin from Sophie do you\nrecommend code Academy I have been used\ncode Academy I've got an account or no\nbecause I keep getting emails from them\nbut I think it's pretty much there's a\nlot of good stuff available so I think\nthat's pretty much try and find\nsomething that suits you so that's a\ngreat timing for the end of our webinar\ntoday thank you all for coming along and\nbig thanks to Martin for two fantastic\nwebinars and presentations and making\nall the materials available through the\npresentations and through our updated\nwebpage we look forward to seeing you at\none of our future webinars and in the\nmeantime have a great afternoon\nthank you very much\n",
