  "text": "hello everyone my name is Alex zoos and\ntoday I'm going to talk to you about\nneurom machine\ntranslation the agenda for today why is\nthis important why am I talking about\ntranslation what was before\nnmt how does it work I want to break\nthat down into\ntwo um I want to focus on Google\nTranslates model the encoder coder\nportion of it and this model of zero\nshot\ntranslation I'm going to go through some\nexamples for you to give you a better\nunderstanding of the progress made with\nit and finally wrap up with a\nconclusion why is this\nimportant the translation industry is a\n$40 billion industry I never really\nthought about how important or how big\nof an industry this actually was also\naccording to New York Times Google\ntranslate alone serves more than 500\nmillion monthly users and translates\nabout 140 billion words per day that\nsounds insane um that's probably a\nportion of not everybody's just going to\nGoogle Translate but in your email and\neverything like that it has Auto\ntranslate um as a part of it so I'm sure\nthe numbers were inflated a little bit\nthere but it's nevertheless important\ngovernment military Community\nneeds maybe here in the US our\ngovernment right now as Congress doesn't\nneed translation so much but you think\nof the UN the European Union Asia not\neverybody has to not everybody is\nspeaking English you have to communicate\nwith people from in different\nlanguages military our Armed Forces who\nare going overseas we have to be able to\ncommunicate to the locals over there and\nour community\nhere in New York every day I'm sure you\nhear a different language that's not\nEnglish so it's really important that\nwe're able to communicate with one\nanother and\nglobalization if you want to start a\nbusiness abroad I don't think you'll be\nable to just speaking English especially\nif you go somewhere in\nAsia before\nnmt so before neurom machine translation\nGoogle especially used this phrase-based\nmodel which was pbmt\nwhere as you can see it's translating\nthis sentence word by word so he goes to\nthe curry restaurant was translating he\nto he goes to goes two to two the curry\nrestaurant was grouped as a phrase and\nthen translated into Japanese and\nreordered based on the Japanese grammar\nstructure you may think that this is\nfine I mean you get a\ntranslation not any of you I don't think\ncan understand translation can\nunderstand the Japanese but it's a fine\ntranslation but what happens when you\nget to more complicated sentences is you\nlose context you don't if you don't\nremember the previous words beforehand\nyou're going to get an inaccurate or\npoor translation and that's where nmt\ncomes\nin so nmt is a new approach to machine\ntranslation that uses a large neural\nnetwork to enhance performance in other\nwords the computer uses deep learning to\nbuild an artificial neural network to\nteach itself how to translate between\nlanguages it uses these neural networks\nto translate entire sentences without\nbreaking them down into smaller parts so\nI'm going to come back to this visual\nlet me restart it because I don't think\nyou're you have to pay attention here\nbecause each Chinese character is\nbeing read in this top encoder once the\nentire sentence is read it is then\nfinally decoded word one word at a time\nin English and one more time you'll see\nthis\nattention you'll see this\nattention here come\nup where that is giving a weighted\ndistribution over the encoded Chinese\nwords most relevant to generate that\nEnglish\nword and and the important thing about\nthis is it keeps the context of the\nsentence and as I mentioned\nbefore about this zero shot translation\nmodel this was one of the coolest things\nI thought when I was doing my research\nso this computer is being trained\ntrained to translate from English to\nKorean Korean to English English to\nJapanese and then Japanese to English\nand without seeing any training data for\nJapanese to Korean it has taught itself\nhow to translate from Jaan jaanese to\nKorean and Korean to Japanese so I\nthought that was a fascinating and huge\nadvancement for uh translation in\ngeneral and now I want to move on to\nsome examples just so you guys can\nreally get an understanding of what's\nHappening here so I have this Japanese\nsentence up top and Microsoft\ntranslator gives you two different\ntranslations one is the old statistical\nmodel or what Google translate called\nthe phrase based model the other is the\nnew neural model so this Japanese\nsentence up top translates down below\nthe morning 5:00 the evening paper 500\np.m. should\narrive that doesn't sound great and then\nyou have the other translation the\nmorning paper will arrive at 5:00 a.m.\nand evening paper at 5:00 p.m. that\nseems like a lot more a more of a proper\ntranslation to the left is is our\nstatistical old\nmodel it's you can see almost how it's\nword by word in that model how it\nwas let me show you\nwith my\npointer here so the morning five evening\nfive will arrive and it's broken down\nword by word this neural translation\njust sounds more natural or more\nappropriate when speaking to someone\nelse quick Japanese lesson for you guys\none of my favorite phrases is this word\nis this phrase called\nIchigo and it's not always easy to\ntranslate to English but using this\nJapanese English dictionary that I use\nonline a lot it's translated as a once-\nin a lifetime encounter and hence it\nshould be cherished as such so as I was\ndoing my research on nmt and seeing the\nprogress I was like wow I want to see\nwhat Google came up with for this I want\nto see the difference and I was really\nsurprised and shocked actually when I\ngot Forest Gump as the\nanswer\num I had no idea what was happening and\nwas very confused until I dug a little\ndeeper and found out that this is\nactually this is also the um subtitle to\nthe Japanese version of forest gum\nso as it was going through the neural\nnetwork it probably saw this more than\nit saw that more difficult\ntranslation and another interesting\nthing about it was when I put this\nthrough Microsoft translator the\nstatistical model was actually\ncloser as you can see one is gum and the\nother is once in a lifetime so it's\nstill difficult and maybe there are\ntimes when we should be using we should\nbe going back to that statistical model\nbut the neurom model has made huge\nprogress and that's what I want to\nconclude with neural machine\ntranslation is really\nimportant for our communities for the\nworld to be able to communicate with\npeople in in foreign\ncountries it's made significant progress\njust in the last year I'm I believe it\nwas last September September 2016 when\nGoogle\num release this and overnight Google\ntranslat um Google Translates results\nimprove significantly but it's not yet\nperfect as you can see it's getting\nthere but the most difficult thing you\ncan think about with translation is if\nyou have a technical sentence you can\ngive five human translators that\nsentence and you might get a different\nsentence back so it's not an easy topic\nbut it's very important\nand I'm really excited to see\nthe to see where this goes in the next\nyear or a few years and if you are\ninterested I highly recommend Stanford\nhas a um YouTube course uh on natural\nlanguage processing where one of the\nlectures focused on neurom machine\ntranslation Google has their research\nblogs and there's different various\narticles online about it so thank you\nfor taking the time to listen to me\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n",
