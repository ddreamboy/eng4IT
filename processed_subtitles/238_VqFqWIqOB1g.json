  "text": "foreign\ndo you use any navigation application to\ngo through traffic jams what happens\nwhen you scroll down through your social\nmedia feeds do you follow any\nrecommendation that any streaming\nservice might give you\nso by the end of the day we know that AI\nis there but do we actually understand\nwhat is going on and can we trust the\noutput of those applications\n[Music]\nforeign\nthe approach that we've taken to these\nkinds of Technologies is to say well\nconsumers can figure this out on their\nown they can read the terms and\nconditions on websites they can choose\nnot to participate in certain digital\nenvironments but increasingly these\nproducts and platforms are part of our\nLives they are part of the way that we\nprovide education they are part of the\nway that we look for jobs and that power\nimbalance cannot be addressed by simply\ngiving consumers more information or\ngiving them individual rights of\ncomplaint what we're ultimately going to\nhave to do if we're going to change the\nkind of structural ways in which these\nTechnologies are designed is to push the\nresponsibilities back on our designers\nback on the organizations who are\nrelying on Technologies to change their\npractices is\nTechnologies like artificial\nintelligence have the potential to\nempower people and to broaden their\nperspectives or\nthey can widen inequalities and really\ndon't contribute to address our societal\nchallenges but we cannot blame the\nTechnologies it's not about the\nTechnologies it's about us developing\nthe framework shaping the rules that\nwill allow these Technologies to deliver\nto what we want them to achieve\nand we need to make sure that we embed\nthose very important ethical principles\nthe protection and promotion of Human\nRights and human dignity that would at\nthe end determine the outcomes\nresponsible governance of AI\nTechnologies without the buy-in of big\nTech and other companies is impossible\nit is necessary for us to find ways in\nwhich to explain to them that ethics is\nnot about abstract principles\nethics should be bottom up it is a\ndynamic system it should enable\nInnovation and in the end lead to trust\nin products of these companies which\nwould lead to success in terms of\nwhatever their business aims are\nwe see how ethical debates end up\nplaying an important role in shaping the\nconversation of AI regulation over the\nlast five years we saw a plethora of\nCharters Declaration of AI ethical\nprinciples\n[Music]\nforeign\nwe are seeing right now that those\nprinciples are being applied on a very\npractical basis\na lot of countries in Latin America have\nalready come up with their National\nstrategies on artificial intelligence\nbut some countries in the region are\ngoing a step further they are actually\nregulating through hard law some of the\nprinciples of artificial intelligence\nin the European Union we're looking at\ndraft AI Acts in the U.S Congress is\nstarting to talk in great detail about\nMonopoly power of technology companies\nand you can see the wheels turning\nacross the world as countries move from\nawareness raising\nto strategy to attempts at\nimplementation attempts at regulation\n[Music]\nlack of accessibility to these\nTechnologies by definition would exclude\none from the debate on responsible\ngovernance because in effect the\ndecisions that are generated in such a\nprocess would just not apply to a person\nwho is not part of the data set so in\nfact you are deleted you don't exist\nwhat is linked to this as well is the\nissue that previously colonized\ncountries are excluded from\nconversations around what responsible\ngovernance would be and this just\nexacerbates the problem\nso there is a first step that needs to\nbe taken which is to understand\nwhich groups are excluded from this\nconversation because when we talk about\nregulation of AI we're talking about\nprivacy we're talking about that\nprotection we're talking about freedom\nof expression we are talking about very\nbasic human rights\nwhat makes the difference is to have\nsound regulatory Frameworks\nthat will protect privacy that will\nenhance transparency that will really\ndeliver on accountability but this is\nsomething we need to shape it needs to\nbe through a process where we listen to\neverybody and I feel that this is the\nonly way we can deliver strong bases for\nthe Technologies to deliver to our human\ngoals\nthe great risk at this point in time is\nthat artificial intelligence becomes a\narms race in which each country only\nfocus on its own context and see the\nother countries as competitors\nAI might build Bridges and connect\npeople and countries\nbut at the same time could be the other\nway around this is the debates that you\nshould care about because that's the\ndebate that is shaping up our future\nwith technology\n[Music]\n[Music]\n",
