  "text": "[Music]\nwell hello everyone my name is Devin\nKnight I will be your instructor for\ntoday to's class this is powerbi\nbeginner to Pro our 2023 Edition we have\nactually taught this class before but it\nwas almost two years ago and as you\nmight expect a lot of things change over\ntime and so we wanted to do a nice\nrefresher of this course that maybe some\nof you have seen before and you can see\nit on our YouTube channel today it is\nactually one of our most popular YouTube\nchannel or videos excuse me uh but we're\nexcited today to give you an updated\nrefreshed view of that because as you\nknow technology changes and it's always\ngood to see how powerbi works today as\nopposed to how it did two years ago so I\nam joined today by one of my colleagues\nManuel kintana he'll be popping up on\nscreen here for a moment he's going to\nbe answering questions in the chat so\nyou'll hear from him throughout the\nmorning and really through the afternoon\ndepending on where you're at locally uh\nbut he's gonna be answering a lot of the\nquestions through the chat as we work\nour way through today's classman well go\nahead and say hello hi everybody super\nuh super excited to be here um I've\nLoved everyone who's attended my events\nyou guys are in for a great ride here\nwith Devon if you're interested in\npowerbi be prepared to be wowed and\neverything's looking spectacular on the\nstream about a 7c delay Dev so we're\ngood to go perfect well thank you Manuel\nwell yeah as I said this is a a pretty\nlengthy three-hour powerbi course but it\nis for beginners so I want to make sure\nI set the context of who this class is\nmeant for if you've been working with\npowerbi for years this class is probably\nnot for you this is a beginner level\nclass where we're going to be teaching\nyou some of the basics of working with\npowerbi and I like to teach it as if\nyou've never done this before so that's\nmy goal is to teach powerbi for someone\nthat maybe totally brand new to it that\nyou'd be able to pick up a few things\nthroughout the day and maybe even those\nthat uh have been working with powerbi\nfor some time might be got get a little\nfew nuggets or tips here and there of\nthings that maybe they haven't seen\nbefore so what I'd like to do to start\nus off for today is to just share with\nyou a couple of the resources that you\nmay want for today uh I've got this\nshared on my screen let me actually show\nmy screen here there we go so a couple\nof the resources for today's class that\nyou need is you will absolutely need the\npowerbi desktop powerbi desktop\napplication is kind of the companion app\nthat goes with powerbi that allows you\nto design solutions that you'll\neventually publish to the cloud uh to be\nable to share your your results or your\nwork with others now the powerbi desktop\nis a Windows application so if you're\nwatching this and you're on a Mac\nunfortunately I have a little bit of bad\nnews for you you won't be able to\ninstall the powerbi desktop on a Windows\noperating system sorry on a Mac\noperating system Mac OS you will need to\nhave a Windows operating system to\ninstall the powerbi desktop now you can\ndo things like run parallels or virtual\nmachines with inside of your Mac\noperating system to do that but just a\nheads up that is potentially a roadblock\nfor some of you that may be watching or\ntrying to play along on a Mac the other\nlink that I have in the chat and by the\nway my colleagues will be sharing these\nlinks in the YouTube chat here as well\nuh these links I'm sharing with you you\ncan grab at any point but the second\nlink that I'm going to be sharing with\nyou is to the class files now the class\nfiles aren't super critical for today's\nclass uh the class files are actually\nsomething we're going to be doing live\ntogether anyways but you'll be able to\nfind my completed Solutions out uh out\nthere you'll also find a few uh images\nthat we're going to be using as\nbackgrounds with inside of our reports I\nshared a few few little nuggets there uh\nbut you can find those class files at\nthe link that I have in the uh on my\nscreen now but you can also I think my\ncolleagues will be sharing them within\nthe chat as well all right so that's a\ncouple of the things that you'll need\nfor today a couple of the resources\nlet's go back to full screen view here\nfor a moment and talk a little bit more\nabout what to expect for today's class\nnow this is uh a recorded class one of\nthe most common questions that we get is\nis this class recorded absolutely\nwhenever we stream to our YouTube\nchannel these classes will be recorded\nand available here for you to watch\nlater if you see any kind of glitches\nwith YouTube just all you can all don't\ndon't forget you can always rewind you\ncan even rewind live in YouTube and you\ncan kind of flip back a few seconds and\ncatch up back to where we were and catch\nyourself up so if I go too fast through\na section if you want to see something a\nsecond time you're on YouTube you can\njust kind of rewind it in the YouTube\nvideo and go back to where I was before\nI went maybe maybe perhaps it was my\nfault maybe I went a little bit too fast\nor maybe you stepped away for a moment\nyou can always rewind me and go watch\nthings a second time now I really don't\nhave a lot of slides other than the one\nI had open up on my screen a moment ago\nI really want to jump straight into the\napplication and get you familiar with\npowerbi because we have three hours\ntogether and tell you what I could spend\na full week with you uh talking about\npowerbi if you'd let me uh or if my if\nmy would let me do it for free that's\nthe other thing but uh what we're going\nto be doing today though is we're going\nto jump straight into the tool and we're\ngoing to use the powerbi desktop to\nconnect into and build a set of reports\nso I'm going to go back to sharing my\nscreen\nhere and I'm going to go ahead and get\nrid of the slides and we're going to\ntalk through first of all of course\nlaunching the powerbi desktop once we\nlaunch the powerbi desktop what are some\nof the areas that we need to be aware of\nuh what are some of the things that we\ncare about whenever we get into the\npower powerbi desktop and where do you\nneed to draw your attention to as you\nstart to work within the tool so I'm\ngoing to be starting by making the\nAssumption you have the powerbi desktop\ninstalled if you don't take a moment and\ninstall the powerbi desktop you can find\nthat uh either through links that are\nbeing shared in the chat from my\ncolleagues uh or you can also of course\nuse a search engine and search for the\npowerbi desktop download uh but I'm\ngoing to be starting launching the\npowerbi desktop today I'm going to take\nmyself off camera for a moment so you\ncan see my start menu here but I'm going\nto go ahead and start my Windows machine\nhere and look for the powerbi desktop\nwhich I have already installed and I'm\ngoing to launch the powerbi desktop like\nso pretty simple stuff so far just\nlaunching the application I'll bring\nmyself back on camera now now once the\npowerbi desktop launches it's going to\nbring up a little startup menu on our\nscreen which we should see Pop open in\nthe middle of my screen here in a moment\nthere it is it's that green background\nthat we're\nseeing and what we can do is we can kind\nof look at the interface that's provided\nto us and we can get a little bit of\ninteresting nuggets from this uh what\nyou'll find is on the leand side over\nhere this is where you can find some of\nthe more recent files that you've worked\non so if you've worked with inside of\npowerbi recently you can find those\nfiles again on the left uh you will find\nthere are some tutorial videos in the\nmiddle those tutorial videos are a\nlittle bit older at this point but you\ndo have some tutorial videos and then on\nthe right hand side there's some useful\nlinks that might be helpful to you as\nwell the one in particular that I tend\nto highlight is the powerbi blog now\npowerbi is updated rather frequently and\nthe powerbi team at Microsoft does a\npretty good job of documenting those\nchanges through their blog so I\ndefinitely keep a pretty close eye on\nthe blog to see what's changed what's\nnew uh whenever there's updates to the\ntool all right but once you're done with\nthat you can go ahead and close this out\nyou can hit the little close button in\nthe top right and that'll take us to the\nmain application here so I'm going to go\nahead and close that all right so here's\nthe powerbi desktop the main view that\nyou'll get used to using over time and\nthe first thing I want to show you is I\nmentioned just a moment ago that powerbi\nis updated very frequently so how do you\nknow which version of powerbi that\nyou're running because maybe you\ninstalled powerbi a year ago or four\nyears ago and you want to know which\nversion of the tool you're running on\nyour\nworkstation so if I wanted to uh go see\nthe version of the tool that I'm running\nI can do that by going up to the help\nmenu and I'll zoom in on this here for\nyou in a moment but I'm going to go up\nto the help\nmenu found right\nhere select about and then it'll pop\nthis open in the middle of your screen\nletting you know which version of the\npowerbi desktop you're running it\nactually it looks like I'm running a\nslightly old version myself there is a\nupdate that did come out in January I\nthink it was January 10th there was an\nupdate of the powerbi desktop I I\nthought mine was up to date even uh but\nthere there are very frequent updates\nand you can always kind of go to The\nHelp menu and about to see which version\nof the tool you're running so so if you\nfind that you're running a particularly\nolder version of the tool then you might\nwant to consider going ahead and\nupdating yours to update all you have to\ndo is download the new version of the\npowerbi desktop and you can just install\nit right on top of the old one you don't\nhave to uninstall the previous one you\njust simply install it and it will take\ncare of it for you all right so that's\nhow you know which version of the\ndesktop tool you're running go to help\nand then about all right so the next\nthing that we're going to do then is I\nwant to highlight the different areas of\nthe tool as a beginner that you really\nneed to to focus in on or that you need\nto be aware of so when you're working\nwith inside the powerbi desktop there's\nseveral areas that I want to draw your\nattention to starting with the git data\nbutton the git data button is your\nstarting place for any new powerbi\nsolution so if you're starting a powerbi\nsolution from the ground up you're going\nto go to the get data button to be able\nto connect to the data that you want to\nuse for the set of reports that you're\ntrying to build so the git data button\nis generally going to be the first place\nyou go whenever you're working with\ninside of powerbi that's a\ngeneralization there's going to be some\nexceptions to that but generally when\nyou're starting a new solution get data\nis where you\nstart the other button that kind of goes\nalong with it or often goes with it is\nthe transform data button over here on\nthe right a little bit further to the\nright and the transform data button is\nwhere you'll go anytime you want to do\nany kind of data manipulation or data\ncleansing to your solution the transform\ndata button launches a tool known as\npower query so when you select transform\ndata this is going to launch a tool\ncalled the power query editor okay now\nthese two buttons together tend to go\nalong in this phase that I and many of\nus at pragmatic Works call the data\nDiscovery phase so I usually like to\nbreak powerbi down into four different\nphases phase one which we'll talk about\nnow is maybe the data Discovery phase\nsometimes also referred to as the data\nshaping phase you can use those as\nsynonyms if you'd like but what you're\ndoing with inside of that data Discovery\nphase is you're going to be connecting\nto data okay so you're going to be\nconnecting to data using the get data\nbutton and then you're also going to be\nmanipulating data or performing data\ncleansing\nsteps and that will be done underneath\nthe transform data\nbutton okay so these two buttons are\ngoing to become very familiar with early\non with your development with inside of\npowerbi these are the first couple steps\nthat you'll use your going to go connect\nto data and then you're going to make\nsure that the data that you brought in\nis actually accurate that's the data\ncleansing step found underneath the\ntransform data section so that's phase\none and we'll talk about that a lot in\nour first hour then we'll kind of merge\ninto a few other topics as we go later\nand later on in the session now let's go\nahead and talk about the other three\nphases the three additional phases\nbecause it's helpful to kind of have a\nfull context of how each of these things\nuh works as you're looking at the Fuller\npicture of powerbi so phase number two\ntends to happen on these two buttons\nover here on the right hand side I sorry\nI said right I mean left uh on the left\nhand side you have a data\nView and you have the model\nview and these two buttons on the Le\nhand side these correlate with the\nsecond phase within your powerbi project\nwhich is oftentimes referred to as the\ndata modeling\nphase what are you doing with inside the\ndata modeling phase well there's\nactually quite a a bit but generally\nspeaking the data modeling phase is\ngoing to be where you're doing things\nlike creating\nrelationships okay so what I mean by\nthat is oftentimes you're going to be\nconnecting into more than one data\nsource and so by creating relationships\nthat allows you to connect those\ndifferent data sources together so say\nfor example you're trying to get an\nunderstanding of what profit like is for\nyour company well generally that's a\npretty complex question because you have\ndata in a lot of different places you\nmight have your income in one data\nsource Maybe income data is stored in a\nSQL server and maybe you have your\nexpenses are stored in Oracle and maybe\nyou have some data in spreadsheets and\naccess databases and data is kind of all\nover the place and so to be able to\nanswer this question that's kind of\noverarching the entire company often you\nneed to be able to create relationships\nbetween those different data sources\nyou're working with so creating\nrelationships is a major part of powerbi\nwe we in a three-hour session we'll have\njust a little bit of time to talk about\nit today uh but I am going to direct you\nto some lengthier sessions where we\nspent a lot of time talking about data\nmodeling uh those are sessions that\nwe've done in the past so you can\nactually watch those today even we we'll\nshare with you uh in a little bit where\nto find that all right so data modeling\nencompasses creating relationships it\nalso encompasses building\nhierarchies and forgive my spelling\nhierarchies is like my Nemesis I I never\nknow if I'm spelling hierarchies right\nbut building hierarchies is the idea of\nbeing able to group multiple Fields\ntogether for the purposes of later\nbuilding reports faster so by grouping\nthose fields together it creates this\nnatural hierarchy of data where you can\ndrill into say for example uh I want to\ndrill into this geography Geographic\nhierarchy and I want to drill into the\ncountry and I want to see okay I'm\nexpanding into the United States and\nthen I can drill down into uh the State\nof Florida where I'm from and then I can\nsee all the cities with inside Florida\nand I can drill down to the city level\nall the way down to a zip code level so\nthat's kind of the idea of a hierarchy\nis it allows you to drill deeper and\ndeeper into your uh data so hierarchies\nare a popular part of um your modeling\nthat you might do and by the way there's\nlots of other things within the modeling\nsteps that you're doing we're trying to\nkeep it a little basic here for today's\nsession and then the third thing I'll\nmention here around data modeling is\nalso encompassed with inside of your\ndata model is this idea of Dax\ncalculations I see lots of comments in\nthe chat about Dax I think folks knew\nthat was coming next right Dax is the\ndata\nanalysis I'll go a and type this\nout expression link\nokay so Dax is the language that you'll\nuse for building calculations so what I\nmean by that is you can kind of think of\nlike what you used you may have done in\nthe past in Excel some of you maybe have\nsome experience with Excel formulas and\nhave worked quite a bit with Excel Dax\nis kind of that idea of those Excel\nformulas you would have done in the past\nor at least it can be it's not exactly\nthe same as Excel formulas but there are\na lot of commonalities there but the\nidea of writing Dax Expressions is often\nwhere you would want to be able to\ncreate some some kind of additional\nmetric let's say that I wanted to\ncompare this year's Revenue to last\nyear's Revenue well to be able to do\nthat comparison you would need to know a\nlittle bit of Dax to be able to return\nback a formula that would show the\nprevious year the prior Year's Revenue\nso Dax is I wish something we could get\nsuper deep into today we're going to\nexplore it a little bit but I will refer\nyou back to some additional classes\nthese are also three-hour classes that\nwe've done on Dax that might be helpful\nto get you further along with Dax if\nyou're ready for that Dax is usually\nsomething that you want to learn and get\na little bit more in depth into after\nyou've been working with the basics of\npowerbi for a little bit then you'll\nwant to dig deeper into how Dax works\nokay all right so that's phase number\ntwo phase number three that we're going\nto talk about is up in the top left\nright above the previous two buttons\nthis would be the report\nView and with inside of the report view\nthis is where you will do what most\npeople think of when they think of\npowerbi Within the report view this is\nphase three this is your data\nvisualization phase and with inside of\nyour data visualization phase of course\nyou're going to be building\nreports okay you're going to be\ndesigning things like uh drill Downs you\nmight do things like tool tips uh we'll\nexplore a few of those things today uh\nyou may also do things like uh explore\ncustom visuals so custom visuals are an\naspect of powerbi that you can work with\nas well so there's lots of components\nhere I'm being being very brief mainly\nbecause the uh screen screen size I have\nhere but the data visualization phase is\nwhile many people think of that as one\nof the core things with powerbi you\nmight notice that the step number one\nand step number two tend to happen\nbefore you build your visuals you really\nneed to have a proper data model before\nyou can build visuals the way you expect\nthem to be returned back so uh while a\nlot of people try and jump rather\nquickly to the data visualization side\nof things within powerbi there's a lot\nof benefits to to investing time and\nbuilding a proper data model and again\nwe'll share some links to some other uh\nclasses that we've done in the past that\nwill give you uh what does a proper data\nmodel mean that right that's me saying\nkind of a very generic term there uh so\nI'll share uh later some classes where\nwe've actually spent some time talking\nmore about data\nmodeling all right so data visualization\nis a big part of powerbi but again phase\none and phase two oftentimes are things\nthat are happening first uh that you'll\nwant to focus in on before you start to\nbuild your visuals okay all right\nso the FI fourth and Final Phase here is\ngoing to be your sharing phase and\nthat's going to happen up here with the\npublish button over where the publish\nbutton can be found phase number four\nthis is your data sharing phase and with\ninside of the data sharing phase there's\na couple things that will happen here\nthis is actually most of this time is\nactually not spent in the powerbi\ndesktop you'll spend a little bit of\nbrief time within the powerbi desktop\nbut then after you publish your solution\nwhich is Step number one with inside of\nthis phase you'll publish your work but\nafter you publish your work where are\nyou publishing it to well you're\npublishing it to Microsoft cloud what's\nknown as the powerbi service and from\nthe powerbi service you'll be able to\nvery easily share your work with others\nso you'll share with\nothers and you'll also be able to do\nthings like schedule data\nrefreshes that's all what's going to\nhappen once you publish your work to the\npowerbi service that's where you're able\nto then share with others make make sure\nyour data stays up to date and then you\ncould also do things like uh roow LEL\nsecurity which we won't have time to\ntalk about Unfortunately today but the\nidea of Road level security at least is\nan important one because the idea of\nRoad level security is where you can not\nonly be able to present results to your\nusers but you can secure the data in the\nreports that you designed so they only\nsee the rows or the results that they're\nsupposed to see so you can make sure\nthat hey Jimmy only sees the southeast\ndata Sandra only sees the Northwest Data\nand while I have only one report they're\nonly seeing the data that's relevant to\nthem and that's all those are all steps\nthat happen with inside of the powerbi\nservice that last one road level\nsecurity is actually something that's\ndone both in the desktop tool and in the\nservice uh so there's a lot that goes\ninto that all right now we're GNA move\non from this if you want to take a\nscreenshot of this I'm done I'm done you\ncan kind of uh move on from this so if\nyou want to take a screenshot for your\nnotes you'll have this available and\nwe're going to move on to our uh first\ndemonstration and it's really going to\nbe a continu demonstration that we're\ngoing to be doing here coming up next\nand what we're going to be doing in our\ndemonstration is walking through pulling\nin some data then using that data to do\nsome data manipulation which is that\nstep number one remember phase one is\nall around data cleansing and that's\nwhat we're going to walk you through is\nhow to connect to data and then after\nyou connect to that data then how do we\nuh start to shape the data to make sure\nthat it is cleansed and we're looking at\nAccurate results then we'll build a data\nmodel we'll talk about building\nrelationships and hierarchies and do a\nlittle bit of Dax today and then we'll\nfinally publish our solution so that's\nkind of our steps here as we get going\ntoday all right and I'm going to tell\nyou what I'm going to kill my teams just\nso it's not popping up on us here that\nwould be frustrating to see teams\npopping up the whole time here I thought\nI did that but apparently not there we\ngo now I did all right so here's the use\ncase that we have for today and by the\nway if you attended our session that we\ndid that was named the same thing two\nyears ago this is going to be the same\nuse case the same demo but you'll see a\nfew different things as powerbi has\nchanged a little bit throughout the last\ntwo years since we did the session last\nbut what I'd like you to do is put your\nimagination cap on here with me for a\nmoment and imagine that you work for a\nbank and the bank that you work for they\nare interested in focusing in on opening\nup another physical brick-and Mort\nlocation right another physical location\nwhere they can serve their customers and\nthere's a there's a lot of internal data\nwith inside of the organization to tell\nthem where that's probably best to do\nthey you have the frequency of your\nvisits from your customers you have the\nhighest density of area where your\ncustomers live but what you like to do\nis to try and bring in some additional\nsupplemental data that maybe can\ninfluence your decision it may not be\nthe overarching reason why you choose\none location or another but it's going\nto be an influencing factor into why you\ndecide where you're going to open up\nyour next banking location and so what\nwe're going to do is we're going to walk\nthrough pulling in some data and the\ndata file by the way that I'm going to\nshow you is in the class files however\nyou don't have to have the class files\nto follow along with this because what\nI'm going to be doing is actually\nshowing you how you can get this uh file\nthat uh we're going to be pulling from a\nwebsite the reason I shared the FI the\ndata source with inside the class files\nis in case any for some reason someone\ncouldn't get to the website that I'm\ngoing to be showing you you'll have a\nbackup plan there you can go look in the\nclass files that I've shared as well all\nright so let me take myself off camera\nand let's shift back in here to My Demo\nand what we're going to be doing is I'm\ngoing to launch open a web browser on my\nscreen you can pick whichever web\nbrowser you prefer and what I'm going to\ndo once I open up my web browser I'm\ngoing to go with chrome\ntoday and what I'm going to do is I'm\ngoing to go to the website\ndata.gov okay so here's the website\nwe're going to right here if you want to\nfollow along you can\nokay\ndata.gov all right so open up your web\nbrowser and go to\ndata.gov and once we go to data.gov what\nI'd like to do is then search for a\nparticular data set that's going to help\nanswer the question where banks have\nbeen unsuccessful in the past because\nthat's going to be an influencing Factor\non where we decide we're going to open\nup our next physical location okay so if\nI want to be able to determine that I\nknow there's a data set on this website\nagain this is on data.gov right now and\nI'm going to search with inside of the\nsearch bar found right here by the way\nthere's loads of data sets here there's\nmore than 335,000 data sets to choose\nfrom but the one that I'm going to look\nfor is one called FDI C failed Banks so\nfor those of you following along you can\ntype that in FDIC failed Banks and then\nonce you do go ahead and hit the little\nsearch over here on the right hand side\nso FDIC failed Banks let me zoom in on\nthat just in case it's a little small to\nread and I'll go ahead and hit the enter\nkey or search to be able to navigate to\nthat all right now this is for me at\nleast it returns back 30 data sets if\nyou notice it returns back a different\nnumber of data sets for you don't get\ntoo hung up on that but what I do want\nyou to do is to follow along with me and\nwe're going to go navigate to this data\nset right here called FDIC failed Bank\nlist and I'm going to select the data\nset by clicking on the name of it on the\ntop right\nhere okay so for those of you following\nalong you can go ahead and click on FDIC\nfailed Bank list the title at the top\nand that will take us into the data set\nthat we're going to be using\ntoday all right so once I've navigated\nhere this will take me to where I can\nactually find the file that's going to\nhave all the data that we want for the\npurposes of today's class and there's an\ninteresting way that we can work with\nthis uh powerbi will allow me to connect\neither to a file that I have stored\nsomewhere locally on my workstation or\none of the really interesting things\nthat powerbi allows you to do is you can\nactually point to a website or a URL\nwhere data is stored now as what I if I\nwas teaching this class interactively\nnormally what I would ask you is what\nwould be the benefit of me pointing to a\nweb URL rather than downloading the file\nlocally since this is a little bit less\ninteractive I won't be able to see your\nresponses in a timely manner because\nthere's a little bit of a delay with\nYouTube uh I'll go ahead and answer\nmyself the benefit here of pointing to a\nweb location or a URL as opposed to\ndownloading the file locally is that the\ndata is going to change right and I want\nto make sure that I'm pointing to the\nmost upto-date view of the data that I\ncould possibly find if I were to\ndownload the file locally that would\nmean I need to go download the file\nanytime there's new changes or updates\nto the data I'd have to go download it\nagain opposed to if I point to the URL I\nknow I'm pointing to the the true source\nof where the data can be found so to be\nable to do that in today's session what\nI'm going to do is I found right here\nand you're probably hopefully seeing it\nas well a comma separated values file\nthat we can use and we can connect into\nnow rather than downloading it so here's\nwhat I want you to be careful with I\ndon't want you to download the file\nwhere you see the download button\ninstead of downloading it what we're\ngoing to do is we're going to rightclick\nnot left click but we're going to right\nclick on the download button and we're\ngoing to select that we want to copy the\nlink address now if you're using a\ndifferent web browser yours may say copy\nshortcut or copy link whatever it may be\nyou're going to copy the URL for that\ndownload button basically where can the\ndata be found behind the scenes because\nwe're going to be using that with inside\nof powerbi and my colleagues that are\nman that are taking care of the chat\nthey can share with you this link as\nwell in case for some reason you have\nproblems making it to this\nwebsite but I'm going to go ahead and\ncop Cy this link address right here\nagain all we did there just to reiterate\nI right clicked on this not left clicked\nright clicked and select copy link\naddress now that I have that URL copied\nI'm going to go back over to the powerbi\ndesktop and I'm going to use that URL\ninside of the powerbi desktop now I'm\ngoing to try and make this interactive\neven though it's a little difficult to\ndo with a delay but let me ask you this\nquestion where do I go now now that I\nhave that URL where's the first place I\nwould go to be able to tell powerbi that\nI want to connect to that data source we\ntalked about it earlier in my drawing\nwhere would I need to go to be able to\nconnect into my data let's see there's\nabout a seven to 10c delay but let's see\nif anybody can guess where's the\nlocation that I should go there we go\nnow we're getting some answers in there\nthank you yvon uh Rachel nice Ellen nice\njob Paula well done yes the get data\nbutton is where we want to go so if I go\nup to the get data button at the top of\nmy screen remember that's to be found\nright up top here we talked about that\none earlier if I go up to the get data\nbutton found right here this will list\noff many of the different data sources\nthat I have available to me now you'll\nnotice here it says common data sources\nthese are not all of the data sources\nthat are available these are the ones\nthat are basically their Microsoft data\nsources but there's far more data\nsources in fact there's more than 150\nadditional data sources that you can\nconnect into if you choose the more\noption down here on the bottom I'm not\nactually going to click on more but I\nwant you to know there's far more data\nsources available than what you see\nlisted on my screen right now if you\nclick more okay but for the purposes of\nwhat we're doing right now what we're\ngoing to do is I'm going to again select\nthe get data button right here and then\nI'm going to select the web option I saw\nsomebody got that right in the chat as\nwell we're going to do web after you\nclick on get data okay so that's the\npath that we're doing right now Peter\nyou're right on get data then web all\nright so I'm going to go ahead and do\nthat on my screen as well hopefully\nyou're following along again if I do\nanything too fast don't forget this is a\nuh YouTube video you can always rewind\nme uh even though this is live right now\nyou can go and Rewind me and watch it\nagain all right so I'm going to go ahead\nand select get data then choose\nweb and once I choose web it's going to\npop open in the middle of my screen\nwhere I can provide the URL that we're\ngoing to be using for today's example so\nuh you can either take the example that\nwas provided in the chat that would be\nthe file that I'm going to paste in\nright now\nor you can rewind and you can see where\ndid I get this URL I got this URL that I\njust pasted in right here I got that\nfrom the data.gov website so if you if\nyou're struggling to find where did I\nget this from there is a link in the uh\nchat uh maybe Minh well if you don't\nmind sharing it again now that we're\npasting it in here right now uh but\nyou'll also be able to rewind the video\na little bit and see how I got\nthat all right very good so now that I\npasted in that URL we're going to go\nahead and click okay right here and\nclicking okay that will allow us to uh\ntake this to the next step basically we\ncan connect into the data and then we\ncan start to use this and pull the data\nin from the website okay even though\nit's a CSV file we're pulling it from\nthe web okay it looks like menwell\nshared the link in there again so if you\nmissed it earlier you can grab that link\nin the chat now all right so I'm going\nto hit okay and this is going to take us\ninto the next step where it'll promp us\nto authenticate authenticate meaning how\nare we going to be connecting into the\ndata uh you can see we have several\ndifferent options I don't want to get\ntoo hung up in this area but what we're\ngoing to be doing for today's example is\nwe're going to be connecting using the\nanonymous example and uh Antonio I'm\ngonna star your question because I think\nwe'll come back to that question here in\njust a\nmoment all right so what you'll find\nhere in the uh on my screen right now is\nthe different methods of how we can\nauthenticate to the website that we just\nprovided that would be the fdic.gov\nwebsite in our scenario we're going to\nbe connecting using the anonymous\nconnector which is the default selection\nand then you can go ahead and get ahead\nof me a little bit and click connect\nokay so if you want to step ahead of me\na few clicks hit connect here and then\nwhat I'm going to do is I'm going to\nanswer Antonio's question that I saw in\nthe chat because it's very relevant to\nwhere we're at right now so Antonio's\nquestion was around the advanced options\nso what I asked you to do is you can go\nahead and hit connect I'm going to take\na step back and answer the question that\nyou see below my my face right now um he\nasked about the advanced options that\nare found right here what the advanced\noptions allow you to do is you can\nactually parameterize the URL so if I\nwere to click on the advanced option\nhere it would allow me to parse out\nparts of the URL and I could pass in\ndifferent parameters in the URL so for\nexample let's say the URL that I'm using\nas a data source has in it a parameter\nfor the year and I want to be able to\ndynamically pass in which year of of\nresults I want to return back\nthis is one of the ways you can do that\nso the advanced options the short answer\nto that question is the advanced options\nallow you to parameterize the URL and\njust return back certain results so\nthere good question thank you for that\nall right let's go ahead and click okay\nand I'm going to catch back up to you\nremember what I told you to do just a\nmoment ago go ahead and click connect\nright here and by clicking connect that\nwill allow us to uh take the next steps\nin this wizard that we're looking at\nright now so I'm going to go ahead and\nclick connect\nall right so once I do that hopefully\nI'm catching up to you now what you're\ngoing to find on this next screen is a\npreview of the results of the data that\nwe're about to get into so this is just\ngiving us a sampling of the data that we\nare going to be connecting into so what\nyou'll find is there's a couple buttons\non the bottom here that I really want to\ndraw your attention into so let me go\nahead and focus in on this area down\nhere on the\nbottom all right so there's three\nbuttons on the bottom here uh the the\ncancel button think is pretty\nself-explanatory I'm not going to get\ntoo deep into the cancel button but\nlet's talk about the other ones here\nokay what we're going to see here is we\nhave load and transform data and I want\nto describe the difference between these\ntwo to you first of all the load button\nwhat it allows you to do is it will\nimmediately load the results of your in\nthis case CSV file but will it will\nimmediately load the results of your\ndata into the powerbi data\nmodel okay so the data model with inside\na powerbi remember we talked about phase\nnumber two being the data modeling phase\nthis would if you hit load that would\njump you ahead to phase number two okay\nthat's what that's what load would do\nhere for me the other option here called\ntransform data what transform data does\ninstead is it is actually going to\nlaunch the power query\neditor with which allows you to\nperform data cleansing steps okay so the\noption here the idea with the transform\ndata button is it will allow me to then\nuh not only Connect into the data but\nthen also make sure that I'm actually\ngetting accurate results returned back I\nwant to make sure that I have results\nthat I'm displaying that not only are\npretty and beautiful with inside of a\nreport but they're actually accurate and\nthat's a big part of what we're what\nwe're trying to do here okay and good\nquestion there in the chat looks like uh\nmanuell has kind of promoted that up we\nare talking about that now so load would\nbe I so let's let's let's word it this\nway I would choose load under pretty\nrare circumstances generally I would\nchoose load is uh when I'm connecting\ninto a data source that really doesn't\nhave that many data cleansing needs for\nexample if I was connecting into a data\nwarehouse which some of you have a data\nwarehouse probably more of you don't\nhave a data warehouse but a data\nwarehouse is a database designed by your\nit Department generally that it's\nalready kind of perfected that's already\ngone through a data cleansing steps so\nif you're connecting into a data source\nthat already has those data cleansing\nsteps done then I would choose load if\nI'm connecting into a data source that\nstill requires me to do some data\ncleansing then I would choose transform\ndata and that's more often what you\nwould do here transform data is probably\nI'd say more than 90% of the time what\nyou're going to choose when you're\nworking with inside of this section okay\nso I'm going to go ahead and choose\ntransform data you can do that as well\nif you're following along now there are\nquite a few of us that are actually\nclicking this at the same time so don't\nbe surprised if uh it may need a little\nbit of a uh a little bit of time to be\nable to pull this in looks like mine\npulled in pretty quickly here though but\nwhat I'm going to be doing here is I'm\ngoing to walk you through a few small\ndata cleansing steps that you can do\nthere's lots of things that we can do\nwith inside of this editor in fact what\nI mentioned just a few moments ago was\nwhen you click on the transform data\nbutton remember I told you it's going to\nlaunch a new window called the power\nquery editor\nand you'll actually see that right here\nthe power query editor window has been\nlaunched inside of the powerbi desktop\nso the powerbi desktop is the\napplication that we're using but it\nlaunches this new window called the\npower query editor that allows us to\nperform the data cleansing steps that we\nneed okay good question uh that just\npopped up in the chat as well again from\nAntonio let me go ahead and pop that up\nuh his question was if you load can you\ntransform later or do you have to start\nover great question if you had chose the\nload option that I showed earlier you\ncan always come back and click transform\ndata here later on if you needed to as\nwell okay so if you make a mistake and\nyou need to come back to this window\nthat I'm showing transform data right\nhere will always bring you back great\nquestion all right so now that we have\nuh the transform data editor open also\nknown as power query editor uh we're\ngoing to actually walk you through a few\nthings with inside of here to perform a\nfew data cleansing steps now one of the\nmost rud rudimentary data cleansing\nsteps that you can do is to remove\ncolumns just bring back the columns you\nactually need right so if I wanted to\nremove certain columns that are not\nnecessary then I can do that in a number\nof different ways and and by the way\nit's worth mentioning that with inside\nof the power query editor that I'm\nshowing right now there's usually about\nthree or four different ways to\naccomplish the same thing so if you have\nbeen working with powerbi for some time\nand you're like oh I do that a different\nway that's okay uh that's okay that you\ndo it differently as long as you know\nhow to do it that's fine there's just\nmultiple ways to be able to solve\nproblems here inside of the power query\nand powerbi for that matter so the way\nthat I'm going to guide you through how\nto remove columns that we don't need is\nI'm going to show you\nunderneath let me zoom in on this for\nyou underneath the Home tab at the top\nwhich you should already be looking at\nbut underneath the Home tab there is a\nbutton here called choose columns and\nwe're going to select underneath choose\ncolumns we're going to select choose\ncolumns again found right here okay so\nunderneath home go navigate over to\nchoose columns right here and then\nselect choose columns a second time\nwhenever you press the down button\nokay all right so once I do that on my\nscreen as well we will see a new\ndialogue box pop up in the middle of my\nscreen asking me which columns do I want\nto include and which columns do I want\nto exclude Now the default is it's just\ngoing to include every single column\nyou'll see there's a check mark next to\nevery column uh listed here but the\nreason why I particularly like this\neditor for removing removing columns\nlike I mentioned there's more than one\nway you can do this but the reason why I\nlike this editor is if you're dealing\nwith a particularly wide data set and\nwhen I say wide I mean you have a lot of\ncolumns like some of you might be\ndealing with data sets that have\nhundreds of columns the thing I really\nlike about this particular feature for\nremoving columns is there's a search\ncapability up top and if I wanted to\nlook for a particular column I could\ntype in the column name and it will\nreturn back the column that want to\neither add or remove that's one of the\nbig benefits of using this particular\nfeature is it gives you the ability to\nsearch for columns and it makes it a lot\neasier to find columns as needed as well\nnow for today's example we are just\ngoing to remove three columns and the\nthree columns that we want to remove are\ngoing to be the CT column and I'll zoom\nin on this in a moment the acquiring\ninstitution column and the fund column\nso the three you're going to remove are\nthese two and this one here as\nwell so take a moment uncheck those\nthree columns that I'm showing on my\nscreen right\nnow and after you uncheck those three\ncolumns which by the way you can add\nthem back in later so just because you\nremove them now doesn't mean you can't\ncome back and get them again later but\nwe're going to uncheck those three\ncolumns and then towards the bottom of\nthis dialogue box you'll click okay all\nright so uncheck these three and then\nclick okay on the\nbottom all right so now that you've done\nthat you'll go ahead and select okay and\nyou'll notice the number of columns that\nare appearing on my screen have now been\nreduced so I now only see four columns\nin my list that I'm going to be a have\navailable to work with now as we make\nthese changes as we apply transforms to\nour data set on the far right hand side\nof my screen and when I mean far right I\nmean way far over on the right right\nhere on the far right hand side of your\nscreen you'll likely see a DOT a pane on\nthe far right called query settings and\nif for some reason you don't query\nsettings let me show you what happens if\nyou for some reason close query settings\nlike mine's now disappeared you can find\nit by going under the view menu and\nquery settings right here this is only\nif you don't see it the majority of you\nshould see query settings but for the\nthe handful of you that for some reason\ndon't see query settings you'll go to\nview and query settings to find\nit all right so what you'll find over\nhere on the right hand side where query\nsettings is this is where you can do a\ncouple things this is where one you can\nrename your query right so right now my\nquery is called Bank list with no space\nnot a very good name this is also\nhowever below where you can see all of\nthe data transforms that you've applied\nto your data set so we want to make a\ncouple changes here first let's go ahead\nand rename our query so right here where\nthe query is called Bank list I'm going\nto rename my query to something more\nappropriate I'm going to call this\nfailed Banks something like that with a\nspace spaces are okay here uh by the way\none thing worth noting here spaces in\nyour column names are okay in powerbi as\nwell many of you that come from maybe\nmore of a database design background are\nprobably used to not putting spaces in\nyour column names not the case in\npowerbi powerbi it's not only okay to\nput spaces in your column names it's\nactually encouraged because you're\ntrying to prepare your columns here in\npowerbi for what your final end users\nare going to want to see and they're\nprobably going to want to see spaces in\nthe column\nnames all right so I can come over here\non the far right and I can rename my\nquery now the other thing and this is a\nquestion from enena so let me promote\nena's question here Irena asked if I\nremove the wrong columns can I add them\nback and the answer is yes here's how\nyou can do that if I made a mistake and\nI remove the wrong columns I can always\ncome back over here to the query\nsettings pane this is not only the area\nwhere you can rename your queries this\nis also Below in the applied step\nsection right here this is where you can\nmake changes to any of the transforms\nthat you performed so to the question if\nI made a mistake and I need to go back\nand make a change how can I do that well\nyou can either edit your transform or\nyou can delete your transform right here\nso what these will do this is your edit\nbutton whenever you see the little gear\nicon you can edit that step you did and\nyou can change which uh which items or\nwhich uh uh which columns you removed or\ndidn't remove and then on the left hand\nside if you just realize that you just\nflat out want to delete it you can come\nover here and you can delete the step as\nwell so to the question from marinaa\ngreat question you would click on the\nedit button that I'm pointing at right\nnow the little gear icon if you realize\nyou made a mistake and you wanted to go\nadd or remove different columns great\nquestion all right let me hide let me\nunzoom for a moment and hide that\nquestion there we go all right so the\napplied step section is going to become\nyour friend you'll find a lot of times\nyou'll go revisit the applied step\nsection when whenever you make a mistake\nor maybe you just need to go back and\nmake a change to what you did previously\nthis applied step section over on the\nright hand side you will visit quite\nfrequently all right so now that we've\nremoved the columns that we don't need\nnow let's think a little bit more\ncreatively with how we'll work with this\ndata and one of the things I know I want\nto do is I want to be able to place this\ndata inside of a map I want to be able\nto map my data uh so that way I can see\nwhere all of these failed banks are\noccurring\ngeographically so one of the challenges\nwith mapping data when you only have\ncity and state and you don't have like\nlatitude longitude is often times you\nmight find that the same city can appear\nin more than one state so I happen to\nlive in the city called Jacksonville\nFlorida but there's more than one\nJacksonville in in the United States\nthere's there's uh a dozen or more uh\nJacksonville within the United States\nand so what I want to do is I want to\nmake sure that whenever we refer to\nJacksonville or Columbus or what name\nname the city right I want to make sure\nthat it's very clear on which\nJacksonville or which Columbus Ohio or\nColumbus Georgia we're talking about so\nwhat I'm going to walk you through is\nhow you can combine two columns together\nnow again like I mentioned earlier\nthere's often times there's more than\none way to accomplish this Pro solve\nthis problem I could select both of the\ncolumns I can click on the column names\nup top here and multi select them by\nholding control and then I could write\nclick and merge them that's one way you\ncan do it but I want to show you a\nslightly different way to solve this\nproblem uh and the reason why why I want\nto show you this different method is\nbecause I think it'll get the wheels\nturning on some other things you might\nbe able to do when you're working with\ninside of the power query editor okay\nnow the feature that I want to show you\nis called\ncolumn from example and what column from\nexample does is it allows you as a\ndeveloper of this query to provide an\nexample of what you end you want what\nyou want the end result to look like\nstumbling over my words there a little\nbit but I got it out so if I want to\ncombine the city and state together I\nwould feed into this column from example\nfeature an example of what I want the\nresults to look like if I wanted it to\nbe City comma State I would do something\nlike that and then powerbi will figure\nout the pattern of what I'm trying to do\nwith the data and then it will replicate\nit for every Row in my data set so it's\na really neat feature um it's a really\npowerful feature that leverages some AI\ncapability behind the scenes to be able\nto find patterns and what you're doing\nand then replicate it for every Row in\nyour data\nset all right so let's go ahead and do\nthis uh the column from example feature\ncan be found by going underneath the add\ncolumn tab found right\nhere and then after you expand the add\ncolumn tab you'll select column from\nexamples and then from all columns right\nhere okay I'll keep this on my screen\nfor a few seconds but again you feel\nfree to pause me at any point even\nthough this is a live event you can\npause me rewind me YouTube allows you to\ndo that all right so we're going to go\nup to add column column from example and\nthen from all columns okay now by\nselecting that what's going to happen on\nmy screen is we're going to see a new\nblank column appear over on the right\nhand side so there's this new empty\ncolumn right here nothing is inside of\nit yet it's simply a blank column that\nwe're going to be able to use and what\nwe're going to do with it is in the\nblank cells with inside of that column\nwe're going to provide an example of\nwhat we want the end result to look like\nso if I'm looking at this at a row level\nhere so let's say I'm looking at this\nparticular row right here what I would\ndo is I would type into this section the\nexample of the city and state combined\ntogether so to give you a little example\nwhat this looks like let me zoom in on\nthis for\nyou I'm going to come into the cell in\nunderneath column one this new column\nwe've created and I'll double click to\nget the cursor to appear with inside of\nthat cell and you can use the\nintelligence here to help you out a\nlittle bit but I tend to find it's a\nlittle better just to type it so I'm\ngoing to go ahead and type in\nalmin comma with a space Kansas the\nabbreviation for Kansas and after I\nprovide in that sample result and I hit\nenter it's going to determine what I'm\ntrying to do and it's going to\nreplicated for every Row in my data set\nso it it figured out powerbi was smart\nenough to figure out that oh you're\ntrying to combine the city and state\ntogether and so what it did was it\nmerged those two together with inside of\nthis new column based on the example\nthat we provided again all I did was to\nreproduce that just to show you again I\ntyped in almina let spell it right\nspelling does matter here by the way so\nif you misspell it it won't work but I\ntyped in Alina comma Kansas hit enter\nand then every row below had this new\nresult that came through now while we're\nhere we can also rename the column you\ncan rename columns later as well but if\nyou ever want to rename a column all you\nhave to do is double click on the column\nheader so right here where it says\nmerged if I double click on that I can\ntype a new name on top of the old name\nand replace it so if I want I can rename\nthis instead of calling it merged I can\ncall it city state something like that\nso I can give the new column name just\nby double clicking on the column header\nand typing a new name on top of the old\nname okay all right so let's go ahead\nand click okay once we're done with this\nnow you can go ahead and click okay I\nwant to show you one thing in the top\nleft here\nin the top left you'll notice that what\npowerbi has done for me it is it figured\nout the pattern of what I was trying to\ndo and then it actually wrote what's\nknown as M query M query m stands for\nmashup by the way but it wrote some M\nquery behind the scenes for us to be\nable to process the data transformation\nthat we're trying to do so what you're\nseeing Right Here is known as\ninquery M query is used with inside of\nthe power query editor I think I saw\nthis question pop up earlier let me see\nif I can actually promote\nit yeah here we go I'm going to promote\nthis question that it came up earlier I\nwas waiting for the right time to answer\nit now's a good time to answer it uh\nthere was a question is Dax the same as\nM and no they're actually different from\neach other what m is used for is more\nfor data cleansing data Transformations\ndata shaping whereas Dax the opposite is\nused for more analytical calculations\nthat you're trying to build so think of\nM as your data cleansing language which\nby the way you're probably not writing M\nby itself very much you're probably\nusing this user interface to do a lot of\nthe M code for you uh but Dax is one\nthat you probably will get a lot more\nHands-On with and Dax is going to be\nused for more of those analytical\ncalculations that you want to build so\nthink of Dax as like I want to be able\nto know and compare this year's Revenue\nto last year's Revenue to be able to\ndetermine what last year's Revenue was\nyou're going to need to know how to do\nthat in Dax using a function like same\nperiod last year kind of thing okay all\nright so good question there earlier I\nheld on to it I wasn't ignoring your\nquestion just wanted the right time to\nanswer it so let me go ahead and get\nthat\ncleared uh uh\noh Manuel can you figure a hi current\ncomment there we go got it all right so\nthat's now that we've kind of got an\nunderstanding of that so it's writing M\nhere for us and there is a question man\nAntonio is killing it with these great\nquestions here not not to pick on his\nquestions a lot but he's got some really\ngood ones Antonio asked the question can\nyou modify or import mcode you\nabsolutely can do that I'm not going to\ngo too deep into it today but I will\nshow you where to go uh I want to make\nsure we kind of keep on Pace where we\nwant to be uh so Anton I'm Gonna Keep\nyour question up on my screen for a\nmoment I will answer that uh but before\nI do let me go ahead and make sure I\nwalk everybody through the next step\nthat I haven't done yet I just need to\nSimply click the okay button here and\nthat will finalize the column that I've\ncreated okay so I'm going to go ahead\nand click okay and that will create that\nnew citystate column all right so\nAntonio's question that I still have up\non my screen is can you modify\nthe M code that's written and you\nabsolutely can modify it if you want to\nmodify the M code for any reason you can\ndo that underneath the Home tab so you\nwould go underneath home and actually\nthere's two different places you can do\nit uh you can go underneath home and\nthen you can select Advanced editor\nright here and I'm not going to open\nthat today because that'll take us down\na rabbit hole I don't want to go down\nfor a beginner course but you can modify\nthe be the M code by going to the Advan\neditor you'll also notice I have this\nlittle formula bar right here I can\nmodify the M code in the formula bar if\nfor some reason you're not seeing the\nformula bar you can find the formula bar\nby going underneath the view menu right\nhere and that will allow you to expose\nthe formula bar if you're not seeing it\nfor some reason okay all right good\nquestion all right so now that we've got\nthat new column created for city state\nI'm ready to start presenting these\nresults in a report I want to be able to\nvisualize this data I want to be able to\nanswer a question here and many of you\nthat have attended these sessions with\nus may already be familiar with this\ndata set so you may know but one of the\ncommon things let's see if we can make\nthis a little interactive and if you\nalready know the answer don't don't\nanswer here with me let's let's play a\ngame here I want to know which state and\nthis is all us data by the way US state\nwhich US state is going to have the most\nfailed Banks answer in the chat let me\nknow which one you think which US state\nis going to have the most failed Banks\njust for fun let's have a little fun\nwith it here and see if we can answer uh\nwhich one we think is going to have the\nmost failed Banks okay all right so we\ngot a couple answers starting to come\nthrough all right I'm I'm purposely\nasking it right now before you can uh\nsee the answer on your screen so we got\nsome good guesses Texas Illinois\nCalifornia Louisiana we've gotten lots\nof good uh good guesses come through all\nright so how can we answer the question\nif I want to know which state has the\nmost failed Banks how can I figure that\nout well I can figure that out by going\nup to first we have to get out of the\npower query quer editor so don't forget\nright now at the moment we are inside\nthis tool called the power query editor\nbut what we want to do is we want to now\ntake the data that we have been working\non and load it into our data model so we\ncan actually start to build some visuals\non top of it okay we got lots of good\nguest that's continuing to come through\non which state people had or think had\nthe most failed Banks so here's what I\nwant to do if I want to see which state\nhas the most failed Banks I need to load\nthis data into my data model so I can\nactually build a visual on it so to do\nthat I'm going to go up to the top left\nunderneath the Home tab if you're not\nlooking at home already you'll want to\ngo to home and we're going to select\nclose and apply and then select close\nand apply again all right now let me\nexplain what close and apply means here\nto make sure this is really clear for\nyou when you select close and apply what\nclose means is it's going to close the\npower\nquery editor all right don't forget\nright now we have this power query\neditor open right here when we click on\nclose it's going to close the power\nquery editor now what apply\nmeans apply means it's going to load the\nresults of your\nquery into the data\nmodel now before we can actually use\nthis data we need to get it loaded into\nthe data model and so what the apply\nportion of the close and apply does is\nit loads the data into the data model so\nwe can actually start to use it okay so\nthat's just to be clear close and apply\ncloses the power query editor and it\nloads the data into our data model all\nright so I'm going to go ahead and\nchoose this on my screen if you're\nfollowing along I have on my screen\nright now what I'm about to do I'm G to\ngo to home close and apply and close and\napply again all right so I'm going to do\nit on my\nscreen home close and apply close and\napply all right our goal here is I want\nto figure out which state is going to\nhave the most failed Banks so let's see\nif we can figure out which one has the\nmost failed banks for us here now what\nyou'll notice in the middle of my screen\nright now is it's loading the data into\nour data model and there's not a whole\nlot of data here but it should load in a\npretty small data set right 563 rows is\nnot a very large data set but it's\nloaded in all of the data from that CSV\nfile into our data set now if it fails\nor it has a problem loading for you just\ngive it another try the reason why you\ncould have an issue loading it in is we\nhave you know several hundred people\nthat are watching this at the same time\nand if we all try and do this at the\nsame time as you can imagine it may be a\nlittle slower pulling that data in but\nonce you load the data in what you'll\nfind on the right hand side of your\nscreen is under your Fields list found\nright here you now have this table that\nappears for you so you now have a failed\nBanks table that's available and I'm\nseeing lots of people in the chat have\nnow figured out the right answer they\ngood um of which state has the most\nfailed Banks and that's what I want to\ndo with you is I actually want to guide\nyou through how to create our first\nvisual from the table that I'm showing\non my screen right now to be able to\nactually see the answer to that question\nquestion of which state has the most\nfailed Banks okay all right so let's go\nahead and show you how to build a visual\nso if I want to build a visual answering\nthe question which state has the most\nfailed Banks we can do that by going\ninto the visualizations pane found right\nhere so here's your visualizations Pane\nand the visual that I want you to build\nwith me is going to be a bar chart this\nis a stacked bar chart right here and if\nyou're following long you can go ahead\nand select the stack bar chart that I'm\nshowing and highlighting right now on my\nscreen and then we're going to start to\nadd in some Fields into that stack bar\nchart together here in a few moments but\nthe first step that we're going to do\ntogether is you're going to go ahead and\nselect that stack bar chart that I'm\npointing at right now all right so I'm\ngoing to go ahead and choose that and\nselect that on my\nscreen and you'll notice over on the Le\nhand side of my screen that this new\nvisual appears with inside of my design\ncanvas and you can resize it you can\nreshape it you can move it around by\ngrabbing it you can really kind of place\nit wherever you want but what I want to\ndo is I want to start to add in some new\nFields into it so if I want to add new\nfields and by the way it's telling me to\nadd new Fields right here right it says\nselect our drag fields to populate the\nvisual what it's telling you to do is\nyou need to go over to the fields list\nand start to bring in various Fields\ninto this visual so you can actually see\nsome results now if I want to see some\nresults in this visual the first thing\nthat you need to be aware of is you have\nto select the visual so one thing to be\nuh cognizant of is you can select either\nthe background of your report and you'll\nnotice it deselects the visual or if you\nclick on the visual you now have it\nselected the reason why I'm kind of\nemphasizing this and why it's important\nis because if you don't have the visual\nselected like if I click in the\nbackground here powerbi thinks I'm going\nto try and create another new visual\nwith the visual selected powerbi thinks\nI'm trying to edit the visual which is\nwhat we're trying to do right now so\nyour big clue to know whether or not you\nhave the visual select is you'll see\nthese little anchor points appear around\nthe edges that's how you know you have\nthe visual selected and you can start to\nactually add things or change the visual\nitself if you don't see those little\nanchor points around it you don't have\nit selected all right so with the visual\nselected we're going to go work our way\nover to the fields list on the right\nhand side so here's our Fields list\nright\nhere and with inside of the fields list\nwe're going to expand the failed Banks\ntable now sounds like lots of you have\nalready done this you're a little ahead\nof me no problem we're going to go and\ngo up to and expand the failed Banks\ntable so you'll see this little Chevron\nhere a little arrow that you can click\non that will expand or collapse the\ntable with inside of the fail Banks\ntable we're going to be creating and\nbringing in a few of the fields into the\nfields list right here okay so we're\ngoing to be dragging and dropping Fields\nover in this\narea all right so what we're going to do\nis we're going to take first the state\ncolumn because we want to know which\nstate has the most failed Banks we're\ngoing to grab the state column and we're\ngoing to drag and drop it into the Y AIS\nnow I should mention this if\nyour uh if your powerbi desktop doesn't\nsay y access if it says access and\nvalues that means you're running a\npretty significantly old version of the\npowerbi desktop and I would recommend\nthat you go update because you're going\nto find there's a lot of things\ndifferent if you're running that old of\na version uh but so just a heads up if\nyour says something slightly different\nright here that means you're running an\nolder version of the tool hopefully\neveryone says y AIS and xais and you're\ngoing to drag the state column into the\ny- axis and we're then going to bring\nthe bank name column into the xaxis and\nthe reason we're bringing the bank name\ninto the x-axis is for the time being I\njust want to do a simple count to count\nall of the failed Banks count all of the\nnumber of banks that I find here all\nright so I'm showing on my screen right\nnow what I'm about to do so you're a\nlittle ahead of me but go ahead and drag\nin state into y- axis and Bank name into\nxaxis all right so let me go ahead and\ndo that on my own as well I'm going to\ndrag the state into the y- axis and I'm\ngoing to drag the bank name into the\nxaxis and if you missed a step there you\ncan go ahead and Rewind the video watch\nit again make sure you're up to speed\nwith what we do that what what we just\ndid now you'll notice when I dragged in\nthe bank name to the x-axis it\nautomatically did a count of Bank name\nthat's because whatever you put in the X\nAIS is going to need to be aggregated in\nsome way uh what I mean by aggregated is\nuh an aggregate is like a count a sum A\nMin a Max an average something like that\nthose are that's what an aggregate is\nand you can change the aggregate that's\nused by clicking the little down arrow\nhere and I can change between a account\nand account distinct right now because\nI'm looking at text I can only really do\ncounts on it but if it was a number\nvalue I could do an average I can do a\nMin a Max a sum those are things that\nyou can do on integers whereas on a text\ncolumn I can either count or do a count\ndistinct\nall right so now that we have that in\nhere I can zoom out and we can see that\nthose of you that answered in the chat\nGeorgia Georgia was the state that had\nthe most failed Banks we can see that on\nthe top right here Georgia the the the\nleader I don't know if they should be\nproud about this one but Georgia Then\nfollowed by my home state so I'm not GNA\nmake fun of Georgia because I'm right\nbehind them with Florida uh Illinois\nCalifornia Minnesota Washington kind of\nround up the top five or six there so it\nkind of shows you here what what's\ninteresting about this and I did a lot\nof talking to get us here right we've\nbeen we've been going for an hour but\nthis is this shows you how you can go\nfrom having no data at all remember we\nstarted this session with nothing and\nthen we kind of built out where we can\nactually start to now start to see\nvisuals come together that we can use\nand we're very quickly able to answer\nquestions like which state had the most\nfailed Banks I didn't know the answer to\nthat until we built out this solution\nand now we can very clearly and easily\nsee that Georgia was the state with the\nmost failed Banks very cool\nokay all right so uh I think think we're\nlooking good here now the next thing\nthat we're going to do is we're going to\nstart to merge into phase number two all\nright so phase number two is going to be\nour data modeling phase all right so\nwe're starting hour number two it's\nprobably a good time to start phase\nnumber two phase number two is all\naround data modeling and how to ensure\nthat we create relationships between\nmultiple sources it's also where we can\ndo things like create hierarchies and\nwhere we can write Dax calculations now\num menwell if you could hopefully you\nhave the link handy and if not I think I\nhave it handy here as well uh we're\ngoing to share a link to a three-hour\nclass very similar to like what we're\ndoing today around data modeling and it\nwas done what by one of my colleagues\nand and Manuel's colleague Mitchell\nPearson it's a great session it's three\nhours just like we're doing today on\nnothing but data modeling so data\nmodeling is a very very important part\nof powerbi in fact it's often an element\nof powerbi that people Overlook even\nthough it's probably one of the most\nimportant things you can do in data\nmodeling so I want to I want even though\nI'm only going to have so much time to\ncover it today I want to make sure you\nhave that three-hour resource and\nmenwell is also shared a secondary Link\nin there to a I would say a a another\ngood more compact version of that if you\ndon't have three hours to learn about\ndata modeling follow the second link\nthat he put in the chat it's about a 24\nminute video those are both really good\nbut it's all around designing a data\nmodel to make sure that you have a\nproper design and solution for building\nyour reports later on okay so those two\nvideos that were shared in the chat one\nis uh by Mitchell that's the three-hour\none one's by Manuel it's about a 25\nminute one they're both very good uh but\nit's a very important part we're only\nunfortunately going to have just a\nlittle bit of time to dig into it here\ntoday uh now we're at a good point for\nquestion I see Matt uh uh Manuel is uh\nkeying me in on a question here from\nMatt Matt asked the question how do you\nchange the table heading from count of\nBank Name by state to something more\nuserfriendly that's a great question\nMatt and you asked it at a great time so\nif I wanted to be able to rename either\nthe let's say for example what we see\ndown here on the the uh the X sorry yeah\nthe x-axis on the bottom or maybe we\neven want to change the title of the\nvisual that's certainly something you\ncan do so to Max question if we wanted\nto be able to adjust things like the\nnames with inside of our visuals we can\ncertainly do that and there's a couple\ndifferent ways you can do that and I\nI'll take this question then we'll kind\nof move on to our data modeling section\nif I wanted to rename that to say total\nBanks instead of count the banks I can\ndo that by going over to my Fields pane\nhere's your Fields pane right here right\nand then from with inside of your Fields\npane you can go down to where you see\ncount the bank name underneath the x\naxis and I saw some people saw they they\nnoticed that their X and Y axis was\nflipped just make sure you put them in\nthe right slot right put the state and\nthe Y AIS and the count to bank name and\nthe x-axis but if I wanted to rename\nthis instead of showing count a bank\nname you could either go and rename it\ninside of your model that would be\ninside the table or a more temporary\nsolution is I can go ahead and rename it\nright here so if I were to double click\nwhere it says count a bank name I can\nrename it just for this one Visual and I\ncan rename it something like total Banks\nright here and if I double click on that\nit gives me the ability to rename it\nagain that's only renaming it for this\none visual if I wanted to have a\ndifferent name for all visuals then I\nwould go and I would rename it with ins\nside of the field list over here on the\nright hand side I double click on it\nhere and I can give it a totally new\nname from the\ntable but if I zoom out notice now\nwhenever whenever I go to look at my\nvisual it now says total Banks down here\ninstead of count the bank so much better\na better way more userfriendly as Matt's\nquestion indicated there more user\nfriendly way to be able to uh display\nand and show uh new columns but renaming\nit in one place only does it for one\nvisual rename it in the table does it\nfor the entire data model that's kind of\nthe difference\nthere all right so let's talk about data\nmodeling here now let's shift gears a\nlittle bit and start to talk about\nbuilding out a proper data model now\nright now as you can see we only have\none table with inside of our data model\nyou can look under your Fields list and\nyou can see we have one table called\nfailed Banks but traditionally you're\ngoing to have more than one table in a\ndata model and that's really where I\nwould I would reference you to go look\nat those links that men well shared to\nthe three hour uh data modeling session\nor the 25 minute data modeling video to\nlearn more about how to kind of properly\nmodel your data but one of the things I\ndo want to show you at least for today\nfor our session where we're covering a\nlot more topics is how you can add in\nmore than one table and then also we're\ngoing to talk a little bit about the\nsignificance of a particular type of\ntable with inside of your data model\ncalled a date table all right so for to\nhave this discussion for a moment I'm\ngoing to go ahead and bring my\nwhiteboard up up on screen\nlike so and I'm just going to draw on\nthe screen here for a little bit and\nwe're going to be talking about a date\ntable all right so let's first of all\ntalk about what is a date table all\nright so a date table is often something\nthat you will have with inside of your\nBI Solutions and I'm specifically saying\nbi not just powerbi other Solutions\noutside of powerbi that are considered\nbusiness intelligence Solutions will\noftentimes also have a date table and\nthe reason why a date table is so\nhelpful and and and can help you in your\ndesign is a couple reasons so let's\nlet's talk about first of all the why\nwhy do I need to have a DAT\ntable\nOkay the reason why it's helpful for you\nto have a date table there's I'm going\nto give you three reasons but there's\nprobably even more reasons than this but\nthe reason why a date table can be\nreally helpful with inside of your\nSolutions is one maybe you're trying to\nanalyze very specific types of dates so\nlet's say for example you have\nspecial dates you want to analyze\nor let's say you want to compare so what\ndo I mean by that let's say you want to\ncompare holidays or you want to compare\nweekends or weekdays or any other type\nof special dates that you might care\nabout there's lots of other examples you\ncould probably come up with so let's say\nfor example you're a retailer in the US\nuh the you in the United States and and\nmany other countries I think have\nadopted it over time but there's a lot\nof special sales holidays like Black\nFriday or uh Cyber Monday right those\nare huge sales holidays with inside of\nthe United States and many other\ncountries as well and if I wanted to be\nable to compare this year's sales on\nBlack Friday versus last year's sales on\nBlack Friday or Cyber Monday I probably\nneed to have some indicator with inside\nof my date table letting me know when\nthat date occurred this year compared to\nwhen that date occurred last year\nbecause the the actual date itself is\ngoing to change it's always a Friday or\nit's always a Monday but that the date\nitself is going to rotate or change a\nlittle bit based on the year and so\nhaving a date table allows me to be able\nto monitor special dates or when it was\na weekend or when it was a weekday\nthat's one of the reasons why you might\nconsider having a date table another\nreason why you might consider having a\ndate table is if you're dealing with a\nfiscal\ncalendar okay so some of you are\nprobably familiar with what a fiscal\ncalendar is others may not be uh but a\nfiscal calendar is something that\noftentimes your accounting team will use\nto be able to uh do budgeting across a\nyear but the years are often times\ndifferent than a traditional calendar\nfor example Microsoft small little\ncompany known as Microsoft right kidding\nof course they're huge uh but Microsoft\nuses a fiscal calendar that begins in\nJuly okay so what that means is if you\nask Microsoft for as far as their fiscal\ncalendar goes when does the year begin\nthey're going to tell you the beginning\nof July is when they started the year\n2023 as far as their fiscal calendar\ngoes okay and so their fiscal calendar\nends in on June 30th and so the the\nfiscal year of 2024 would begin on July\n1st for them coming up so there's a lot\nof companies that use fiscal calendars\nMicrosoft is not the only one many of\nyou probably do as well and the reason\nwhy it's helpful to have a date table is\na date table will help you map a\ntraditional calendar date to a fiscal\ndate and so with inside of your date\ntable you'll have a list of your\ntraditional calendar dates and then\nright next to it you'll have a fiscal\nperiod and a fiscal year and a fiscal\nquarter so that's why it's really\nhelpful to have that's another reason\nwhy it's really helpful to have a date\ntable is when you're trying to anal\nanalyze things over a fiscal\ncalendar all right the third reason and\na very popular reason why you would\nconsider having a date table is if you\nare trying to design Dax time\nintelligence okay so let's spell that's\nalways fun when you miss misspell\nintelligence uh but Dax time\nintelligence time intelligence is with\ninside of the uh data analysis\nexpression language that's what Dax is\nagain as reminder but using the time\nintelligence functions with inside of\nDax allow you to be able to compare\nperiod over period or a 12-month rolling\naverage or if you wanted to really do\nany kind of time analysis you generally\nneed to have a date table first before\nyou do it there's some time intelligence\nfunctions that you can do without a date\ntable but there's some others that are\nreally beneficial for you to have that\ndate table that you created that you\ndesigned that has your fiscal calendar\nin it to be able to do that time\nintellig\nanalysis so when I say time intelligence\nI'm talking about things like analyzing\nyear to dat or quarter to dates or maybe\nI want to look at uh year-over-year\nor maybe I want to see a 12month rolling\naverage something like that those are\nexamples of time intelligence functions\nyou might build into your data model and\nit's far easier to do those if you have\na date table already okay all right so\nnow that we answered the why that's why\nneed to have a date table let's answer\nthe question of how do you create a t\ndate table how do I get a t how do I get\none okay so there's a couple different\nways you can get a date table one you\ncan import a dates\ntable from your data\nsource so if you're connecting into a\ndata warehouse for example uh by\nconnecting into a data warehouse your\ndata warehouse likely already has a date\ntable and you would simply connect to\nthat date table and use it with inside\nof your model so step number one there\nor option number one would be I have a\ndate table in my data Boy base and I'm\njust going to connect to it because it's\nalready got all the things I need so\nthat would be the easiest example the\neasiest option but it's not maybe\nnecessarily the most common option not\neveryone is going to have a date table\nthey can pull from from with inside of\ntheir data source\nalready okay so that's one thing to\nconsider if your data source has a date\ntable great use it if not then you need\nto consider other options all right so\nlet's talk about what what the other\noptions are and menu well if you can get\nhandy there should be a URL to a date\ntable script uh if you can share that in\nthe chat that will go along with the\nnext little item here so the next thing\nthat you could do is you could create a\ndate\ntable using power query and more\nspecifically using the M formula\nlanguage all right so you can use M\nquery to be able to design your own date\ntable and Manuel is going to share a\nlink in the chat to a Blog that I wrote\na number of years ago that will actually\ncreate a date table for you\nautomatically all you have to do is copy\nand paste my code and there it is you\nput it in there now but you can copy and\npaste my code inside of that blog and\nyou can bring it into Power query and it\nwill create a DAT table for you I\nparticularly like that method I think\nit's a great method for creating a date\ntable however we won't be using that\nmethod today and the reason why I'm not\ngoing to be using that method today is\nbecause I want to show you the third\nmethod which is Dax uh the I really want\nto get you a little bit of a peak into\nwhat Dax is because it's so much more\ncommonly uh needed uh than the inquery\noption the the writing inqueries is\nsomething that's done far more rarely\nthan writing Dax and so I think this is\na great opportunity for me to show you\nhow to write Dax by using uh uh by\ncreating a date table so I'm going to\nguide you through that but uh Manuel did\nshare a link in the chat if you're\ninterested and learning about how to\ncreate a date table using M query follow\nthe link he put in the chat and that'll\nkind of take you there all right now the\nthird option which is what we're going\nto be doing in our example today is\nwe're going to design a date table using\nDax again Dax being the data\nanalysis expression\nlanguage okay and again the reason why\nI'm going to show you the Dax method I\nactually kind of like the power query\nmethod a little bit more but the reason\nwhy I want to do the Dax method today I\nthink it's a great way to help you learn\nDax a little bit in a beginner session\nlike today um and we're going to be\nexposed into some of the basics of\nwriting Dax by using that method today\nso both methods are fine by the way\nreally there's not a right or wrong\nanswer to which of the bottom three you\nchoose you can choose to import it\nthat's fine you can create it with it a\npower query that's fine uh you can do it\nwith Dax that I'm which is what I'm\ngoing to be showing you today that's\nequally fine there's not a right or\nwrong answer to what you choose here\nokay now there is a question the in the\nchat and unfortunately because I'm in my\ndrawing mode here I won't be able to uh\ngo go promote it but uh how is this\ndifferent than the auto date table so\npowerbi does create a date table behind\nthe scenes for you to do some things the\nread and thank you men for promoting\nthat uh the reason why I prefer to\ncreate my own date table as opposed to\nusing the auto one is for some of these\ntop reasons we mentioned here uh powerbi\ndoes kind of create a little bit of a\nsecret date table behind the scenes for\nyou uh and uh it's it's great that you\nhave that option available to you but my\npreference is to create my own date\ntable so I have a lot more control over\nit so I can have my own special columns\nthat I want to be part of it nothing\nwrong with using that date table that's\ncreated for you but it's kind of hidden\nfrom you you don't actually see the DAT\ntable that powerbi creates for you uh\nwhereas this one is much more visible\nand you can design it you can do\nwhatever you want with it okay all right\nso if you want to screenshot of these\nnotes now is a great time to take it\nbecause we are going to be moving on\ninto our next section here uh in in this\nnext section I'm going to show you\nexactly what we just described here I'm\ngoing to show you this method right here\nof how to create a date table that's\nwhat we're going to be covering next\nokay all right and and uh there's a\ncomment in the chat there is a great\nthirdparty I'll go Ahad and promote this\nthey're uh there it's uh from sqlbi they\nhave a great tool called Bravo uh and I\nbelieve it's a free tool um that will\nactually create a date table for you as\nwell definitely check that out that's at\nSQL bi.com uh they're another great\ncompany by the way they do some of the\nsame stuff we do but hey we're we're\nfriendly with them uh they have a great\ntool called Bravo out there that will\nactually create a date table for you all\nright but I'm going to show you how to\ndo it on your own let's say you don't\nnecessarily want to use another tool I'm\ngoing to show you how to create a date\ntable on your own and we're going to be\ndoing it using the Dax method that I\ntalked about earlier all right so if I\nwant to create a date table on my own\nwhat the way I'm going to guide you\nthrough doing this is to go navigate\nover on the left hand side we're going\nto go navigate over to the data view\nfound right here so if you're following\nalong with me go to the data view on the\nleft hand side to be able to follow\nalong\nokay all right so I'm going to go ahead\nand select the data view that little\nicon on the left and this is by the way\nwhat the data view does is it literally\nshows you a view of your data it's kind\nof like a readon Excel you can't you\ncan't come in here and change any of the\ndata you can read it all you can't\nchange it necessarily but you can look\nat it and the thing I like about this\nview is when you're creating a date\ntable with Dax is it'll actually allow\nyou to see the columns and the data\nbehind the columns that you're creating\nas you go so what we're going to do is\nwe're going to start by creating a new\ntable again we went to the data view so\nif you're following along make sure you\nselect the data view here with us first\nand then under the data view we're going\nto go up to the top and select table\ntools it should already be open by\ndefault and then we're going to select\nnew table right here so we're going to\ncreate a new table with Dax by selecting\nthe new table option under theath table\ntools\nand we're going to be doing this using\nDax all right so I'm going to go ahead\nand select new\ntable and when we do that this is going\nto be our first exposure into the Dax\nformula language here okay so with\ninside of the Dax formula language this\nallows us to be able to create\ncalculated formulas calculated tables\ncalculated measures to be able to\nenhance our model and create new objects\nthat our users can take advantage of\nwhenever they're building out reports\nnow the way that this is exposed with\ninside of the tool is you'll notice this\nnew formula bar appears at the top of my\nscreen and to make this a little easier\nto see I'm going to zoom in on this and\nfor those of you on a Windows device\nyou'll use the control key in your mouse\nwheel if you want to zoom in or zoom out\nof that formula bar Control Plus Mouse\nwheel will allow you to zoom in and zoom\nout okay all right so over here now in\nthe formula bar a couple things I want\nto point out to you everything to the\nleft left of the equal sign right here\neverything to the left of the equal sign\nis going to be the name of our object so\nthe name of our table the name of our\ncolumn the name of our measure whatever\nit is we're working on and then\neverything to the right of the equal\nsign is going to be the definition of\nthat objects okay so what I mean by\ndefinition is this means Dex so you're\ngoing to name it to the left of the\nequal sign and then to the right of the\nequal sign we're going to uh\nactually uh provide the definition of it\nokay all right so here's what we're\ngoing to do is in that formula bar we're\ngoing to go ahead and rename the table\nso where it says table we're going to\nrename it instead of calling our table\ntable we're going to go ahead and rename\nthe table to be called calendar and I'm\ngonna zoom in on this even more just to\nmake sure it's really clear for you I'm\ngoing to go ahead and type in\ncalendar\nokay all right then that's going to be\nthe name of our new table and then to\nthe right of the equal sign we're going\nto need to write the Dax that will\nDefine what our table is going to return\nback and we're going to use a particular\nfunction called calendar\nAuto okay now the calendar Auto function\nwhich you can see on my screen right\nhere what it does is it scans all of the\ndate columns you have with inside of\nyour data your data model so it's going\nto look at any date columns I have with\ninside of my data model and what it will\ndo is it will create this continuous\nlist of dates continuous meaning there's\nno breaks there's no there's no missing\ndates but it's going to create this\ncontinuous list of dates into a new\ntable for me it's going to start at the\nvery first day of the first year that I\nhave with inside of my data model and\nthen it's going to end on the last year\nof the it'll just end on December 31st\nof the last year I have with inside of\nall my date values so calendar Auto\nautomatically generates this list of\ndate values inside of this new table\nokay and I see a question why are we\ncreating a date table you may want to\nrewind the video a little bit we did\nsome whiteboarding where we talked about\nthe why uh you can go back a little bit\nand we answer that question of why we're\ndoing this all right so I'm going to go\nahead and select calendar\nAuto and uh by the way this is called\nintellisense let me briefly mention this\nas I start to type in the name of the\nthe function I want to use this is Dax\nand you'll notice this little section\nright here this is called intellig\nand it's designed to help you write Dax\nso if you're not really familiar with\nwriting Dax you can leverage this\nintellisense to help you be able to\nreturn back values that you know if\nyou're not an expert in Dax and you\ndon't know every single uh function\nthat's available to you then you can use\nthe intelligence to kind of guide you\nthrough uh writing it here if you need\nit\nokay if the intelligence isn't working\nfor you uh unfortunately I can't share\nscreens with you to see what's going on\nbut you may want to just uh backspace a\nlittle bit try again all right but we're\ngoing to go ahead and type in calendar\nAuto and I can actually click on it\nright here if I wanted to and underneath\ncalendar Auto this would allow me to be\nable to return back that special\ncalendar Auto function okay and if I go\nahead and do a close parenthesis on this\nthat would close out this function now\none thing worth noting there is special\ncapabilities with calendar Auto if\nyou're dealing with a fiscal calendar\nremember we talked about fiscal\ncalendars earlier that that's one of the\nreasons why you might consider using\nthis function because you can tell it\nwhen is the end of your fiscal year when\nyou use the calendar Auto function now\nwe're not going to be taking advantage\nof that capability today but I did want\nyou to know that there's some\ncapabilities when you're trying to build\nout a date table and include fiscal\nvalues with\nit all right so we're going to go ahead\nand type in calendar Auto and do an open\nand close\nparenthesis and uh I'll tell you what\nI'll do I'm actually going to put my\ncalculation here in the chat for you so\nfor those of you following along you'll\nbe able to kind of look in the chat and\nI put my function there but I'm going to\nuse this calendar Auto function to\nreturn back a list of all of the date\nvalues that I could use with inside of\nmy data set okay now again all calendar\nAuto did was it scanned the date columns\nthat I have and we do have one date\ncolumn called closing date and it\nreturned back and it uh returned back a\nlist of all of the possible dates we\nmight need this is a distinct list\nmeaning it's a unique list of date\nvalues that we have available to us with\ninside of this new column that got\ncreated for us right here so you can see\nthis new column called Date got created\nafter we use that calendar Auto function\nokay all right very good uh question in\nthe chat what if we need two more years\nto do some forecasting or something like\nthat so uh calendar Auto might not be\nthe right answer if that's the problem\nthat you're trying to solve so the\nquestion that's popped up below my face\nright now is what if I need need Beyond\njust the current years that are\nappearing whenever I use calendar Auto\nin that case you might want to use a\ndifferent function called\ncalendar but not calendar Auto but just\ncalendar and what the calendar function\nwould allow you to do is you can pass in\nspecifically which start date and end\ndate you want to have whenever you're\nusing the calendar function so there is\nan alternative there if you uh need to\nhave future dates as well then that's\nkind of what you can do to be able to\nmanage\nthat all right very good so now that we\nhave this new column and new table\ncreated by the way you can see my new\ntable over here called calendar it\nappears you'll notice the little cal\ncalculator icon on it that tells you\nthat little calendar uh calculator icon\nindicates that it is a\ncalculated table so it indicates to you\nthat it is a a table that was created\nusing Dax uh if you see that little\ncalculator icon on it right now our\ncalendar table only has one column but\nwe're going to add a few other columns\nto it is as well okay so if we want to\nadd in a second column in a third and a\nfourth column we'll actually have a\ntotal of four that we create here if we\nwant to add in another column into this\ndata set we can do that by going up to\nthe table tools tab\nagain and this time we're not going to\nclick new table because we already did\nthat this time we're going to create a\nnew column so for those of you following\nalong we're going to create a second\ncolumn here and we're going to do that\nby going up to table tools and then\nselecting new column\nall right so I'm going to go ahead and\nselect\nthat all right so what this is going to\ndo is it's going to pop open another new\nformula so if you look up in the formula\nbar here you'll notice it's kind of\nblank again waiting for us to create a\nnew column and what we're going to do is\nwe're going to create a uh a year column\nI want to have a column that parses out\nthe year from the date so if I wanted to\ncreate a slicer or a filter where I just\nwanted to filter on the year 2022 or\n2023 or 2024 whatever the Year may be I\nwant to have a column where I can select\nwhich year that I want to filter on so\nback inside the formula bar up at the\ntop here we're going to rename the\ncolumn remember my tip for earlier\neverything to the left of the equal sign\nis the name of the column everything to\nthe right of the equal sign is going to\nbe the definition of that column so to\nthe left of the equal sign we're going\nto rename this column\nyear and then to the right of the equal\nsign we're going to uh give this a\nproper function and don't worry we will\ntake a break here shortly I see uh we're\ngoing to take a break right at an hour\nand a half which which is about five\nminutes uh so the year function or the\nyear column that we're going to do is\nwe're going to leverage the function\ncalled year with inside a powerbi and\nyou'll notice there's lots of other\nfunctions in powerbi that leverage year\ncapabilities like same period last year\nor previous year or start of year lots\nof other functions you can use here but\nthe one that we're going to use is the\nyear function and we're going to pass\ninto the year function a date column\nokay so using the year function we can\npass in our date column that we see\nright here and the way that you\nreference a date column is you reference\nreally any column Name by using square\nbrackets so think of brackets like this\nthat's a bracket and that's how you\nrefer to a column name with inside a\npowerbi so if I use the square bracket\ngetting a little over ancy there with my\nbrackets if I use the square bracket\nyou'll notice intelligence immediately\ntries to help me out and it lists all of\nthe column names that I have with inside\nof this table that I I could potentially\nselect\nfrom so what I want to do is I'm going\nto select the date\ncolumn and you could type it in there if\nyou want rather than selecting it like I\ndid you'll notice Intellis since\ncontinues to try to help you out you can\nignore this additional help that it's\ntrying to do and just do a close\nparentheses so what we what we did here\nis we said that we want to parse out the\nyear from the dat\nand I want to only return back the year\nall right I'll put that in the chat for\nyou as well well so yeah to Sydney's\nquestion here square brackets is equal\nto column names now sometimes you may\nalso want to refer to the table name as\nwell Ina just in case that same column\nname exists in multiple tables you can\nalso refer to the table name as well if\nyou use single quotes So it would look\nsomething like this this is optional the\nthe table name is optional here but but\nif you want to be very precise with how\nyou refer to column names you can first\nrefer to the table name which is called\ncalendar and then the column name is\ngoing to be in Brackets table names and\nsingle quotes column names and brackets\nall right but the the table name is\nactually optional here we don't have to\ndo it unless you really want to refer to\nthe table name okay all right yeah if\nyou missed something just go ahead and\nRewind a little bit you can rewind the\nvideo and catch back up all right so\nwe're going to create two more columns\nbefore we take our break uh to create\nanother column we're going to do that by\ngoing back up to table tools again okay\nso I'm going to go back up to table\ntools and underneath table tools we're\ngoing to select new column again right\nhere okay we're going to create two more\ncolumns so I'm going to go back up to\ntable tools and select new\ncolumn and in this third column that we\nnow have we're going to name this\none month\nnumber and there's a specific reason why\nwe're calling it month number that will\ncome into play after our break so hang\ntight I'll I'll answer the questions of\nwhy we're creating a month number column\nwe're going to also create a month name\ncolumn here in a few moments as well so\nI'm sure there'll be some questions\naround why we have two month columns I'm\nleading you a little bit into our demo\nafter our break so uh just call this\none's going to be called month number\nand then to the right of the equal sign\nwe're going to define the month number\ncolumn using the month\nfunction and remember we used the year\nfunction in the previous example this\ntime we're going to use the month\nfunction\nhere and just like we did last time\nwe're going to pass the date column into\nit so if you would like to put the table\nname in it I saw some people like uh\nsome people in the chat like to put the\ntable name in it as a best practice no\nproblem you can put the table name in it\nuh so table name would be calendar and\nthen the column name that we're going to\nrefer to here is going to be our date\ncolumn\nall right so all we're doing in this\nexample again is we're saying here's our\nmonth sorry here's our date column I\nwant to parse out the month number from\nthe date and that's what we have on our\nscreen right now is we're using this\nmonth function to say return back the\ndate the the sorry return back the\nnumber of the month from the date that\nwe're looking at okay so yours should\nlook something like this I'll put this\nin the chat for\nyou so if you want to copy my code from\nthe chat you should see it in there as\nwell all right so now that I have that\nnew column created we're going to create\none final one before break and this one\nis going to return back the name of the\nmonth so I want to have the month number\nbut I also want to have the month name\nso we're going to create one final\ncolumn again going back up to table\ntools we're going to select new column\nfor the final time\nhere okay so I'm going to go ahead and\ndo it on my screen as well table tools\nand then new\ncolumn and menuel there should be a\nreference I gave you a link to if you\ndon't mind sharing that here coming up\nuh it's going to be to more information\nabout the format function if you can\nhave that handy uh but what I'm going to\nuse this time is we're going to name\nthis fourth and final column that we're\ncreating we're just going to call this\nmonth you can call it month name if you\nwant but I'm going to just leave it as\nmonth by itself and then what I'd like\nto do with this one is I want to return\nback the name of the month rather than\nthe number of the month and there's\ngoing to be some reasons for us having\nboth of these columns that we'll discuss\nlater but we're going to start by\ncreating uh a new function using the a\nnew column created using the format\nfunction\nokay all right so we're going to go\nahead and using the format function\nwe're going to tell it that we want to\nformat that date column that we created\nearlier so we're going to refer to that\ndate column and we're going to format\nthe date column in a particular way I'm\ngoing to use four lowercase\nM and using those four lowercase M that\nwill allow us to format the month\nspelled out so if I hit enter now you'll\nnotice that it creates this new column\nfor me called month and then all of the\nvalues here are returned with the\nspelled out month name I could also do\nthree lowercase M and it'll bring a\nmonth abbreviation I could optionally do\nthree lowercase Ms with y y y and it\nwill bring back the month and year so\nyou got a couple different options there\nbut what we're going to do for our\nexample is I'm just going to return back\nthe month name but the point is I want\nto show you how the format function has\na lot of different options available to\nyou I would certainly recommend\nexploring that link that Manuel put in\nthe chat for you there's lots of other\nways you can use that format function\nBeyond even just dates you can use it\nfor other purposes as\nwell\nokay all right very good well uh we now\nhave our date table created we have our\nfour columns our date column year column\nmonth number column and month column now\nwe are going to take a break so we're\ndue for a break we're about an hour and\na half in a little bit more than an hour\nand a half we're going to take a\n10minute break and then when we come\nback from break we're going to keep\nmoving forward we got a few other things\nwe're going to talk about but let's go\nI'm going to put a 10-minute timer on my\nscreen so you know when to return back\nI'll see everybody back in 10 minutes\nand uh good luck so far see you\nthen\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne e\n[Music]\nn\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\n[Music]\ne\ne\ne e\nall right everyone we are ready to come\nback I'm going go ahe and take this off\nmy screen and I want to share a few\nthings as we come back from our break\nhopefully that break was timely for you\nI saw quite a few people were were ready\nfor a break as so was I uh but what I\nwant to talk about briefly as we return\nback is if there is interest for\nadditional training obviously pragmatic\nWorks hopefully many of you are already\nfamiliar with us but our sole focus is\ncentered around training and education\nthat's everything that we do at\npragmatic works is focused on that now\nfor those of you attending today's\nsession uh and this is we do have a\nspecial offer that's going to be center\naround our live top boot camps so if you\nlike the idea of live training if you\nenjoy uh in-depth training obviously\ntoday's three-hour class I will not be\nable to make you an expert in powerbi in\nthree hours however we definitely have\nthe tools to be able to get you there\nand so I want to share with you I'll\npull this up on my screen here for a\nmoment uh we have going on through the\nend of this month you can let me hide\nthis I'm not sure if you're seeing that\nor not but there we go but going through\nthe end of February you can look at any\nof our boot camps and get $250 off so if\nyou have an interest in being able to\nattend some of our live training we do\nhave a lot of live boot camps that we\nteach we have three different boot camps\nthat we teach on powerbi we have a more\ntraditional powerbi boot camp that's\nfour days long we have a Dax boot camp\nthat's four days on nothing but Dax so\nif you really are eager to learn more\nabout Dax I would certainly recommend\nour Dax boot camp and then we also have\nuh a pagea reports boot camp as well\nthat's a three-day course and so if\nyou're looking to go more in depth into\nany of those areas pagein dat reports is\npart of powerbi uh we have many\ndifferent boot camps on those different\ntypes of courses and so when you go to\nour website I'll pull up our website\nhere in just a moment but when you go to\nour website and you select a boot camp\nyou can put in the code L WTN learned\nwith the Nerds 250 and that will get you\n$250 off our your boot camp so just to\ngive you a little peek at that uh these\nclasses I see questions are they in\nDubai these are all virtually taught uh\nso they are virtually generally taught\nin Eastern Time Zone uh but you can find\nwe have a pretty big list of boot camps\nthat are coming up on a variety of\ntopics not just powerbi but we have some\non Azure uh power apps t-sql t-sql by\nthe way is a great skill to learn even\nfor powerbi developers I would certainly\nrecommend going through our offerings of\nboot camps I'll put this link in the\nchat so if you want to take a peek at\nboot camps we offer you can scroll\nthrough see which one's appropriate for\nyou but these are really designed to go\nin depth go go beyond the basics of what\nwe can do in a three-hour session or\neven a one-day session and check check\nout what we have there and see if that\nmight be a good fit for you uh we have\nmany different boot camps that are\ncoming up and again that discount that I\nput on my screen I'll pop it up one more\ntime just so you can see that again that\ndiscount is good through the 28th of\nthis month but you can schedule them for\nboot camps that go till the end of April\nso uh keep that in mind that is 2023\nmake sure in case someone's watching\nthis as a recording a year from now it's\nuh 202 three is when that's four all\nright very good well thank you so much\nif you have questions on those as well\nfeel free to uh I'm sure our team will\nbe happy to answer any kind of questions\naround the sale in the chat so that's\navailable U for your uh for for any\nquestions you might have all right great\nso I'm going to take that off my screen\nnow thank you so much for listening and\nbeing patient for for hearing about our\nboot camp offering what I want to\ncontinue with now is to get back to the\ndemonstration that we left off on and uh\nwhat we're going to be focusing in on\nover the next half of our day is we're\ngoing to be looking at our data model\nand data visualizations and then we'll\nwrap up with the powerbi service so we\ngot quite a bit to cover in an hour and\na half here so we will at times go a\nlittle faster and don't don't worry\ndon't don't forget this is recorded you\ncan always go back rewind a little bit\nand go back to see something again as\nwell okay all right so we left off we\ncreated our date table this on my screen\nright now is exactly where we left off\nand then what we're going to be doing is\nwe're going to uh uh go a little deeper\ninto what do we now do with this date\ntable so we created this date table now\nwhat do we do with it right so I want to\nbe able to leverage this date table with\ninside of my model I want to be able to\nactually see the uh results of my date\ntable with inside of a visual so if we\nwant to actually leverage this date\ntable we created in a visual we're going\nto work our way back over to the report\nview right here this is the report view\nokay\nall right so if you're following along\nwith me navigate back over to the report\nview for a moment and inside the report\nview what we're going to do is we're\ngoing to create another new visual okay\nand if we want to create a new visual we\nneed to make sure we click in the\nbackground of the report okay don't have\nthe other visuals selected and with no\nother visuals selected we're going to\ncreate a quick little column chart to\nshow us the number of failed banks by\nmonth for example so if I go to select\nthe Stacked column chart right here that\nwill allow us to Monitor and show by\nmonth the number of failed banks that we\nwant there's lots of other visuals we\ncould choose we're going to go ahead and\nselect the Stacked column chart for this\nexample all right so I'm going to go\nahead and select stacked column\nchart and that will bring the stack\ncolumn chart on our design canvas here\nand we can reshape it or resize it\nhowever you want I'm going to lay it out\nkind of like this like so and with\ninside of my stack column chart I can\nstart to bring in new Fields into it\nright so just like we did in our first\nvisual it's all about dragging and\ndropping the visuals into the design\nCanvas OR into the fields pane the the\nvisualizations pane so that way you can\nstart to build out uh your Visual and\nactually get data return back in your\nvisual so what I'd like to do in this\nexample is I'm going to go over to my\nFields list on the far right so this is\nour Fields list on the far right over\nhere again we're in the report view now\nand I'd like to be able to see the\nnumber of failed banks by month so to do\nthat I'm going to drag in the month\ncolumn into the x axis like so and I'm\ngoing to bring in the bank name column\nright here into the Y AIS just a little\nbit lower below it and just as we saw\nearlier where we saw the count to banks\nby State this now should return back the\ncount to banks by uh by month\nokay all right all right so I've showed\nyou on my screen what I'm about to do\nnow let's actually do it myself so I'm\ngoing to go ahead and bring in the month\ncolumn down into the xaxis like so and\nI'm going to bring the bank name column\ndown into the Y AIS like that okay so\nyour screen should look like what you're\nfinding right here xais has month y AIS\nhas count to bank now if I zoom out for\na moment you'll notice the visual that\nit creates probably is not what we\nexpected we're actually seeing the same\nnumber of banks appearing for every\nsingle month this would appear as though\n563 failed Banks happened on every\nsingle month clearly that's not right\nand so this is actually uncovering a\nproblem in our data model the problem is\nthat there's no connection between the\ntwo tables that we're using so if you\nlook over on the field list you can see\nthat we're using the calendar table and\nthe month column and we're using the\nfailed Banks table and the bank name\ncolumn however the thing that we're\nmissing and Jackie is right on in the\nchat there is we need to create a\nrelationship between those two tables by\ndefault it did not create a relationship\nfor us some sometimes powerbi can do\nthat but in this scenario it didn't\nactually create this relationship\nbetween the two tables for us and the\nresult of that is we see the same number\nof failed banks for every single month\nnot quite what we\nexpected so if I want to be able to fix\nthis problem we need to pay a visit over\nto the model view on the left hand side\nso on the left hand side of my screen\nright here we're going to go to the\nmodel view and from with inside the\nmodel view that's where we can create\nrelationships if they don't already\nexist okay and again by creating this\nrelationship the the problem that we're\ntrying to solve is that we see the same\nnumber of failed banks for every month\nthat's the problem we're trying to solve\nhere all right so if you want to follow\nalong with me we're going to go over to\nthat model view that you see right\nhere I'll go ahead and select it on my\nscreen as well and the model View kind\nof looks like a database diagram right\nit's going to show you a diagram of all\nof the tables that you have with inside\nof your data model you can zoom in on\nthis by the way if you use your uh hold\ndown the control key and use your mouse\nwheel you can zoom in on this a little\nbit to make it a little easier to see\nbut what I'd like to do is I want to be\nable to create the relationship between\nthese two tables now the question for\nyou is probably how do I know what the\ntwo uh how how do I know how do I Define\nthe relationship between these two\ntables and here's the thing you really\nhave to think about from your point of\nview when you're doing this on your own\nwhat you need to ask yourself is this\nquestion what is the commonality between\nthese two tables what is the thing that\nboth of these two tables have in common\nand when you look at it pretty closely\nyou'll probably be able to figure out\nthat the commonality between these two\ntables is the date right you have a date\ncolumn in the date the calendar table\nand you have a closing date column in\nthe fail Banks table that's really the\ncommonality between those two tables or\nthe two tables we're looking\nat so if I wanted to create a\nrelationship between these two tables we\ncan do that by simply dragging the date\ncolumn and when I say drag I mean you're\ngoing to click on date and you're going\nto click and drag date on top of closing\ndate right here click and drag one on\ntop of the other now a common question\nthat we get will can is can you drag\nclosing date on top of Date and\nabsolutely you can do that powerbi is\nactually smart enough to figure out what\ndirection the relationship needs to go\nregardless of which direction you drag\nthe\nrelationship so what happens after you\ndo that drag and drop and let me show\nyou that one more time what happens when\nyou drag closing date on top of Date\nyou'll\nfind that it automatically designs the\nrelationship for you it automatically\ncreates the relationship for you and\nyou're seeing that on my screen here\nthat line that relationship line between\nthe two tables is the indication that\nthese two tables are able to communicate\nwith each other now when you hover your\nmouse above the line you'll actually see\nthat it highlights The Columns that are\nthe basis of the relationship so when I\nput my mouse above the line notice that\nit highlights the date column and the\nclosing date column those are the\ncolumns that are the basis of the\nrelationship here\nokay so there's a great question and I'm\ngoing to go ahead and pop this up from\nMarty Marty asked the question that\nthey've seen double lines occasionally\ndouble arrows so what you might be\nnoticing on my screen right now is I\nhave this single arrow pointing right\nhere and so the question is what is that\nwhat does that mean uh that Arrow\nindicates the direction that filters can\noccur so whenever you go to build a\nreport and you say that you want to\nfilter the number of fail banks by year\nyou're allowed to do filters going in\nthis Direction only based on on how the\nrelationships are designed right now\nthat's what this little uh Arrow\nindicates that's the direction that\nfilters are allowed to navigate the\ndirection that filters are allowed to go\nif you see double arrows double arrows\nwould look like this don't worry about\nhow I'm getting it just want to show you\nif you see double arrows like this\nthat's what Marty's talking about that\nmeans that filters can go in either\ndirection you can filter fail you can\nfilter down calendar from fail Banks and\nyou can filter fail Banks from calendar\neither Direct is allowed there now there\nare some extra implications of you\nhaving that turned on we don't really\nneed that for today I'm going to leave\nit back how it was I just wanted you to\nknow that's the difference that's what\nthe arrow means there the arrow\nindicates the direction that filters are\nallowed to be applied which Which Way\ncan they go okay good question let me go\nahead and hide that one all right so the\nother thing that's worth noting here is\nthe indicators that you see right here\nand right here this is what's known as a\none to many relationship or many to one\nthe the way that it's aligned right now\nbut let's the more common way of\nphrasing it is this is a Ono many\nrelationship what a one to many\nrelationship means is that the column\nfrom our calendar table that's our date\ncolumn and the column from our fail\nBanks table that would be our closing\ndate column have different instances of\nhow many times they can appear when you\nsee one the one side of the relationship\nthat means that the date column is\nunique meaning you're never going to\nhave the same dat date appear more than\nonce with inside the calendar table\nhowever closing date is not\nunique because and it kind of makes\nsense right you can think about it if\nI'm allowed to have more than one Bank\nClos on the same date so it's not\npossible that my failed Banks closing\ndate would be unique because I very\nlikely have had some banks that happen\nto have closed on the same date so\nthat's what the one to menum means it\nmeans that you have unique set of values\non one side of the relationship and not\nunique uh set of values on the other\nside of the relationship now this is\nwhere I would highly highly recommend\nthat you review that data modeling and\nwell maybe you can share it again we\nhave a three-hour session specifically\naround data modeling where we talk much\nmore about the different types of\nrelationships uh I wish I could go more\nin depth into it today we have a lot of\nother things that I want to cover though\nbut what I will mention is that one to\nmany relationships are the most\ndesirable type of relationship to have\nin powerbi there are other types that\nyou can leverage and use there's many to\nMin there's one to ones uh those are\nless ideal uh for a number of reasons\nthat I wish we had more time to talk\nabout today but generally speaking one\nto many relationships are what you want\nto aim for whenever you're building out\nyour model are there exceptions to that\nstatement absolutely there's there's\ncertainly exceptions to that statement\nbut generally speaking uh you want to\ntry and stick to one and many\nrelationships and that's where that idea\nof a star schema comes into play a Star\nschema is where you have traditionally\nmany different on to many relationships\nand menwell did put the links to the the\nuh YouTube class I was referring to uh\nand the shorter video in the chat if you\nwant to go back and refer to that again\nlater all right so we have designed\nwhat's known as a one to Min\nrelationship it's Unique in the calendar\ntable it's not unique in the failed\nBanks table and that's the way we want\nit for this\nexample all right so now that the\nrelationship is created we can actually\ngo back over to the report view up in\nthe top left right here so we can go\nnavigate back over to the report View\nand we can see now that the relationship\nhas been created it will fix part of the\nproblem that we have in the column chart\nwe created a few moments ago there's\ngoing to be some other problems we need\nto fix as well but this uh first problem\nof seeing the same number of values for\nevery month has now been fixed by\ncreating the relationship so let's go\nnavigate back over to the report\nView and you'll notice when we look at\nour column chart that now it shows a\ndifferent set of values for every month\nwe're not seeing 563 failed banks for\nevery month anymore now it's showing a\nlittle bit more the way we would\nanticipate it to show here now that\nwe've done that okay looking\ngood all right now I did see someone\nelse identified a problem earlier in the\norder of the columns in the column chart\nthey notied that the months were not\nsorting the way you would traditionally\nthink they would sort and so that's the\nnext problem that we're going to walk\nyou through is how do I fix the sort\norder now the sort order problem is\nreally kind of a it's both a data\nmodeling problem but it's also a\nspecific problem with the visual itself\nthat we can fix as well and so we're\nreally going to walk you through both\nhow do I fix uh the sort order of the\nvisual and then how do I fix the sort\norder of the data model those are really\ntwo different problems we're going to\ndiscuss here\nall right so to fix the sort order of\nthe visual we're going to go hover above\nthe\nvisual like so so have your mouse\nhovered above the visual and you'll see\nthere's this little three dot menu in\nthe top right it's called more options\nwe're going to select more options and\nunderneath that three dot menu when you\nclick on it you'll see there's a sort\naccess that you can modify and the\nchange that we're going to make here is\nwe're going to tell powerbi that we want\nto sort by the month and that we also\nwant to sort in ascending order so we're\ngoing to make those two changes right\nhere and right\nhere now when you do this after you\nchange one of these two settings the\nmenu will clear out and you have to come\nback into it a second time that's why\nI'm kind of drawing on my screen right\nnow so that way you have an idea of what\nyou're going to end up doing after we\nmake these two two different\nchanges all right so here's what we're\ngoing to do again we're going to click\non the three dot menu select sort app\naccess and we're going to sort by\nmonth then you'll notice that it does\nchange the sorting by month however it's\nsorting alphabetically in descending\norder so we need to also go back into\nthat three dot menu click more options\nselect sort access and choose sort\nascending okay so those are the two core\nchanges we need to make here sort by\nmonth and sort\nascending all right so I'll go ahead and\nselect that and you'll see now that it\ndoes change the sort order of our visual\nhowever the sort is probably not the way\nyou thought it would sort right it looks\nlike it's sorting based on the month\nname not the month number okay and Randy\nhas a comment in the chat you know it\nwould great be great if we could also\naccommodate year in here some way\nabsolutely we might put in a year slicer\nwe might do a couple things in here\nbecause right now this is showing the\nnumber of fail banks for every year the\nway that it's uh laid in here right now\nso you could add other things in here uh\nRandy is absolutely right about that I\nwould put like a slicer or something\nlike that in\nhere all right so here's what I want to\ndo I want to now that we see it sort by\nmonth I want to also make sure that it's\nsorting by the chronological order\nrather than the alphabetical order right\nwe would never want to sort it this way\nthis doesn't make sense as a way to\nactually sort your data instead what we\nwant to do is we want to sort it\nchronologically so to the question right\nhere in the chat that's what we're going\nto be covering next how do we fix it so\nit sorts chronologically rather than\nsorting alphabetically okay so let's\ntalk about how to do that to change the\nway that it sorts chronologically this\nis really more of a data modeling\nproblem than it is a problem with the\nvisual the previous problem we fix by\ngoing into the properties of the visual\nand changing the sword order to change\nhow the column itself behaves then we\ncan actually show or change the data\nmodel to ensure that it actually\nproperly sorts chronologically or by the\nmonth number remember I told you the\nreason we were creating the month number\ncolumn would come back later it's coming\nback now uh now we're going to use and\nleverage that month number column we\ncreated and here's what we're going to\ndo let me whiteboard this briefly the\nsteps that we're going to do is we want\nto display the month\nname but sort\nby month number and that's what I'm\ngoing to walk you through how to set up\nhere in this next little mini demo this\nis a pretty small one okay so if I\nwanted to display the month name but\nsort by the month number what you would\nneed to do is you're going to go\nselect from your calendar table from the\ncalendar table you're going to select\nthe month column click on it not the\ncheck mark But actually the name of the\ncolumn and by selecting the month column\nwe can then change the sort order of\nthat column by using a certain property\nthat I'm going to show you next so your\nfirst step for following along is you're\ngoing to go over to your Fields list on\nthe far right and you're going to click\non the name not the check mark But the\nname of the column called month from\nyour calendar\ntable with that column selected you can\nsee it's highlighted on my screen right\nnow with it selected we're then going to\ngo up\nto the column tools tab up top now if\nyou're not seeing column tools that\nmeans you didn't do the previous thing I\njust showed you you're not going to see\nthe column tools tab up top unless you\nfirst select the month column so if\nyou're not seeing column tools on your\nscreen make sure you go back over here\nand select the month column first\nwithout that you're not going to see\ncolumn\ntools all right so with the month column\nselected we're going to go up to column\ntools right here and there's a property\ncalled sort by column right here and\nwhat this column allows you to do is you\ncan display whichever column you\nselected earlier but then you can sort\nby a different column and what I want to\ndo is I want to sort by the month number\nwhile still displaying the month name\nall right so that's what we're going to\nbe doing in this little mini example\nhere so for those of you following along\ndon't forget select the month column\nfirst then come up to column tools right\nhere select sort by column and choose\nmonth number and that will allow you to\ndisplay the name of the month but sort\nby the number of the\nmonth all right so let me go ahead and\ndo that on my screen as well well I'll\nselect month number and watch what\nhappens to our visual now look at that\nthat looks beautiful right we can see\nJanuary February March April May all\nsorting the way you would anticipate\nthey should sort whenever you look at\ndate data right so looking pretty good\nthere great all right so looking like we\ngot that set up uh I'm trying to see I\nthink I actually answered a bunch of\nthese questions that uh you start so I\nthink we're good there all right so\nlet's do this now that we've got the\ndata sorted here properly and\neverything's starting to come together\nthe next thing that I want to show you\nis how you can create calculated\nmeasures okay so before lunch or before\nlunch before our 10-minute break I\nshould say we created a set of\ncalculated columns with inside of our\ndate table right with inside of our date\ntable we created a month column a year\ncolumn a month number column but we\nhaven't really explored measures yet so\nthat's what I want to do with you in\nthis next section is walk you through\ncreating and sorting not creating and\nsorting but creating measurement data\nokay and very briefly I want to\nwhiteboard with you and describe the\ndifference\nbetween calculated\ncolumns and calculated\nmeasures\nokay and I'm going to make some\ngeneralizations here there's definitely\nsome exceptions to what I'm going to\ndescribe here so don't hold me to a\nstrict definition of each of these\nbecause there's definitely uh except to\nsome of these rules I'm about to tell\nyou now calculated columns are like the\ndates table we created earlier remember\nin the date table we created a year\ncolumn we created a month column or\nmonth number column and then we created\na month column at the end those were all\ncalculated columns that we created okay\nso these are examples of calculated\ncolumns um oh thank you looks like I'm\nmisspelled calculated I saw someone put\nit in the chat that should be a d thank\nyou um but calculated columns are kind\nof fundamentally different with how\nthey're used generally speaking again\nI'm making some generalizations here but\ngenerally speaking calculated columns\nshould be used or are used for more\ndescriptive type data okay what I mean\nby that is something that describes a\nmetric of some kind okay again there's\nexceptions to this but I'm trying to\nmake some generalizations so that it's\neasier to understand the difference\nbetween these\ntwo so calculated columns more for\ndescription type data calculated\nmeasures are a little bit different so\ncalculated measures are going to be used\nfor more metric data okay so when you\nthink of metrics generally metrics are\ngoing to be numeric in nature right\nyou're going to have some kind of\nnumeric value uh their calculated\nmeasures are often generally going to\nhave some kind of an aggregate value\nthat go along with them okay so they're\ngoing to be aggregations if you're not\nfamiliar with what an aggregation is\nthat's something like a sum A Min a Max\nan\naverage uh standard deviation account so\non and so forth you kind of get the idea\nthose are examples of aggregations\nso generally calculated measures are\ngoing to be different because they're\nmetric values you're trying to you're\ntrying to measure something right get\nthat's where the word measures comes\nfrom they're generally going to be\nnumeric although there are even some\nvery rare exceptions to that and then\nthey're going to have some kind of an\naggregate that goes along with them I'm\ntrying to sum count min max average that\nsort of thing so we don't have a ton of\ntime in today's class for me to show you\na bunch of measures but I want to show\nyou at least one I want to give you a\npeek at how you create a measure and as\nwe go through that you'll see how it's a\nlittle bit different than how you create\ncolumns it's not a lot different but it\nis a little bit different uh in how you\nwould create calculated columns like we\ndid earlier in this session so here's\nwhat we're going to do I'm going to\ncreate a new measure and the way that\nI'm going to create a new measure is by\ngoing over to my failed Banks table so\nI'm going to go over to the right hand\nside and look at my Fields list now I\nwill mention this if had a lot more time\nthere are some special tricks and best\npractices around creating measures some\npeople actually like to create a whole\nseparate table for measures that stores\nonly the measures and nothing else I\nactually think that's a great practice\nwe're just a little limited on time to\nshow every little nook and cranny of\nthings you can do here but if you're\nfamiliar with uh creating like a\ncalculation table it's it's a great way\nof organizing your measures so everybody\ncan so any of your users that are\ndeveloping reports can go look in one\nplace and see the measures that are\navailable to to them I'm not going to\nhave time to do that today but just know\nthat you can create tables that their\nsole purpose is just to store measures\nthat is a common practice and a way of\norganizing measures for today's class\nfor interest of time we are going to\ncreate a measure with inside of my\nfailed Banks table so with inside of my\nfailed Banks table that we already have\nI'm going to rightclick on my failed\nBanks table right click right\nhere and select new measure okay so\nagain we right clicked on the name of\nthe table in our Fields list so right\nclick\nhere and then we're going to select new\nmeasure after we do that right\nclick\nokay all right so I'm going to go ahead\nand do that on my screen as well I'll\nright click on fail Banks and select new\nmeasure now when we do that what's going\nto happen up on the top of our\nscreen is just like what you experienced\nearlier this morning remember this\nmorning or before our I say morning I\nrealize people are watching from\ndifferent time zones uh but if I go up\nto the top here you'll notice that the\nformula bar now has a new calculated\nmeasure ready for me to write and then\neverything to the left of the equal sign\nis going to be the name of our measure\nand everything to the right of the equal\nsign is the definition of our measure so\nwhat I'd like to do is we're going to go\nahead in rename our measure I'm going to\ncome up to the top\nhere and I'm going to rename our measure\nto the left of the equal sign and I'm\ngoing to call it total\nBanks and then to the right of the equal\nsign we're going to create a measure\nthat returns back the count of banks now\nthere's lots of different ways we can do\nthis but for Simplicity for today I'm\ngoing to use a function called count\nrows do note though there are lots of\ndifferent count functions that are\navailable to you notice here there's a\nreally big list of different count\nfunctions you can use the one however\nwe're going to use for today's example\nis Count rows which allows us to count\nall of the rows with inside of a\nparticular table and the rows that we\nwant to count are going to come from our\nfailed Banks\ntable so remember from earlier we talked\nabout single quotes or how you identify\na table name and we're going to tell it\nthat we want to count all of the rows in\nour failed Banks\ntable like so and that's it that creates\nthis count rows function for us if I\nwant to or if I want to I'll I'll\nactually share that function in the chat\nwith you so if you want to have that\nhandy you can grab that from the chat\nbut now we've created a measure and the\nbenefit of creating this measure is it's\nnow uh reusable you know remember before\nwe were dragging in the bank name into\ndifferent places well that didn't really\nmake sense to do it's not it's not Bank\nname we really want to see a total count\nof Banks and so while we were kind of\nleveraging the bank name earlier to do a\ncount like you see right here really\nwhat we should have been doing was we\nshould have created a measure like we\ndid now and we should have used that\ntotal Banks measure instead of just\ncounting the number of banks that's a\nbetter practice for a number of reasons\nuh one it's better because it's now\nreusable and I can Nest it inside of\nother calculations I create later two\nit's also beneficial because I can do\nspecific formatting for it up here and\nit saves that formatting and that\nformatting is then reusable and it's uh\nit doesn't necessarily help that much\nmore with performance or anything like\nthat the benefit here is not performance\nrelated it's more from a usability\nstandpoint it makes your life a lot\neasier to do this as a calculated\nmeasure versus a calculated column the\ndifference performance wise is pretty\npretty nominal uh but the the the the\nmaking your life easier benefit is a\nmuch much better better way to go okay\nall right so if I wanted to take\nadvantage and actually show this measure\nand action I could create a set of\nvisuals or another Visual and I could\nstart to bring in some of the things\nthat we've done here or I could even\nreplace the count the banks with inside\nof the other measures by simply\nselecting the visual and when I select\nthe visual I can then change out of\nwhich particular fields that we're using\nokay so you can see right here I have\ncount to bank name I could get rid of\nthat and I could swap in instead I could\nbring in the new Total Banks measure\nthat we created that you see right\nhere okay now the net result is it\nshould look almost exactly the same as\nwhat it looked like before that's kind\nof the point uh but it makes it so it's\nmuch more reusable and I can Nest this\ncalcul calculation or calculated measure\ninside of other measures I create in the\nfuture as\nwell\nokay all\nright very good all right so I think\nthat's about I want to make sure we have\ntime to get into the data visualizations\nas well as time to get into some of the\npowerbi service uh elements later on as\nwell so we're going to call call it into\nthe data modeling section for today and\nwhat we're going to shift gears into\nnext is the data VIs visualization\naspects of powerbi now the good news is\nwe've already gotten a head start here\nright as we've been working with inside\nof powerbi we have actually explored\nmany of the different data visualization\nelements as we've been going but I want\nto add to that I want to spend some\nspecific time talking about just data\nvisualization best practices and\ndifferent design elements that you might\nwant to consider for example let's say\nthat I wanted to uh enhance or change or\nmodify the visuals that we've used so\nfar in some way you can modify the\nappearance of the visuals that you're\nusing so far by first selecting the\nvisual so you'll need to click on the\nvisual and with the visual selected you\ncan then modify it by going over to the\nformat section over on the right hand\nside that would be found right here\nagain don't forget you first have to\nselect the visual to modify the visual\nbut with the visual selected if you want\nto change the appearance of the visual\nsay for example the font or or the\ncolors used or something else you can do\nthat by going up to the format button\nfound right here and this allows you to\nformat the visual that we have selected\nright now so I'm going to go ahead and\nselect the format button and again you\nneed to have the visual selected first\nbut with the visual selected if I go\nover to the format button I then have\nthe ability to modify the visual through\na number of settings that are made\navailable to me in this section right\nhere uh there are two different tabs you\ncan kind of toggle back and forth\nbetween you can look at the general\nsettings where you can change things\nlike the title so if I want to change\nthe title I can do that here or you can\nlook at the visual settings and\nunderneath the visual settings you can\ndo things like add in data labels so if\nI want to add in data labels to my\nvisual I can do that by going over to\nthe data label section underneath the\nvisual\nmodifiers and again how did I get here\nwell I got here by clicking on the\nlittle format icon right here you have\nto have a visual selction\nfirst so if I want to add on data labels\nI can click on the data label button\nfound right here and that will make my\nvisual or allow my visual to Now display\ndata labels with inside of it and when I\nturn that on notice you can now see data\nlabels that appear above every one of\nthe columns in the column chart looks\npretty good looks really good now you\ncan also modify those data labels if I\nexpand the data label section I can\nmodify and say hey instead of seeing\nthose data labels um in a certain\nposition let's actually change the\nposition of those data labels to\nshow inside the end of the column chart\nand when I do that you'll notice now all\nthe data labels are actually inside the\ncolumns in the column chart they were\nabove previously so the point is you\nhave lots of different things you can do\nto kind of go in and modify the\nappearance of your visuals uh that's\njust one example adding data labels but\nthe way that we found that the way that\nwe got to it is by selecting the visual\nright here and then going over to the\nformat button right there and you'll\nfind lots of different options as far as\nchanging the colors changing the font\nadding data labels that's all found\nunderneath the format section with\ninside of powerbi and the change that we\nmade was we turned on data labels\nokay now I show you that because I\nreally want to lead you into a more\nadvanced topic around that just a little\nbit more advanced so what's nice is that\nyou can change your visual appearance\nbut wouldn't it be great if you could\nchange the appearance of all of your\nvisuals at once okay maybe I really want\nto modify every one of my visuals at\nonce and and have a set standard color\nscheme a set standard font type I wanted\nto basically standardize the way that my\nreports are designed and you can do that\nusing a feature called themes so that's\nwhat I'm going to show you next is a\nlittle bit about how to leverage and use\nthemes so themes are again the purpose\nof them is to standardize the look and\nfeel of the reports that you create so\nthey're all using the same colors\nthey're all using the same font same\nbackground color same primary color all\nof that you can modify with inside of a\ntheme and the where you're going to go\nand I think this is going to answer\nAntonio's question Antonio you you got\nlike the hot hot mic here on questions\nuh Antonio's question is can you import\ncolor schemes and yes uh you can you can\nactually we'll we'll give you a little\npeek at that here in a few moments as we\ndiscuss themes uh but absolutely you can\nkind of modify the colors that are being\nused you can customize the colors you\ncan use HTML colors there's all kinds of\ndifferent things you can do around\ncolors we'll talk about that as we go\nthrough this next little\ndemo all right so let's talk about\nthemes how do you create a theme how do\nyou modify a theme how do you export a\ntheme that's all what we're going to\ndiscuss in this next\nsection so themes are something that you\ncreate by going underneath the view menu\ninside the powerbi desktop so up on the\ntop I'll zoom in on this so you can find\nit up at the top you'll find there's a\nview menu and Under The View menu\nthere's a section here devoted to themes\nright here and if you want to change the\ntheme you can change to one of the\ndefault themes that are provided to you\nor you can make your own Theme by going\nunderneath the theme section right here\nall right so we're going to show this in\naction as on my screen as well again\nwe're going to go under the view menu\nand select the themes section right here\nwhen we expand the theme section you'll\nsee this whole new area pop up on your\nscreen and you'll see there's some\npredefined themes that you can select\nfrom right here some of them are good\nsome of them are okay uh there are some\none for accessibility reasons that have\nbeen added there's ones like color blind\nsafe themes which are kind of nice and\nthen there's some other themes that are\nare kind of interesting uh maybe you go\nwith the the very bright purple theme\nI'm not sure if that's one you would\nselect but maybe in reality you want the\nability to create your own theme so if\nyou want to create your own theme you\ncan do that by going down to the section\non the bottom again this is uh Under The\nView menu and you expand the theme\nsection here you'll see there's a\nsection here called customize current\ntheme on the bottom left or towards the\nbottom left and if you select customize\ncurrent theme that allows you to be able\nto modify a theme modify and create a\ntheme of your own and then to Dan's\nquestion I'm GNA go ahead and promote\nDan's question here for a moment Dan\nasked can you import a theme used on\nyour company's website so basically what\nhappens and I'm going to walk through\nportions of this as we go through short\nanswer is yes you can import a theme\nthat someone else has created however it\ndoes have to be created with inside of a\nJson file Json file is just basically a\nway of storing the metadata for how the\ntheme is going to appear so short answer\nis yes you can import a theme can you\nimport it from your website uh it may be\nit may be a little bit different than\nhow your website themes are stored but\nI'll show you you kind of get the the\npicture of how that's done here as we go\nthrough this\ndemonstration all right so what we are\ngoing to do is I'm going to select that\ncustomize current theme option found\nright here okay so I'm going to go ahead\nand select customize current theme and\nthat's going to pop open a new dialog\nbox in the middle of our\nscreen in the middle of our screen we're\nseeing this option here where we can\ncustomize the theme that we have\nselected and I can make any kind of\nmodifications to the colors that are\nbeing used you can name the theme you\ncan do all sorts of stuff now you don't\nhave to follow me exactly here if you\nwant you can you can make your theme\nlook different than mine uh normally\nwhat I would do if I was teaching this\nclass live as I say all right I want you\nto make the ugliest theme possible we're\ngoing to have a competition of who can\nmake the worst looking theme just for\nthe fun of it but unfortunately you\nwon't be able to share your theme with\nme so you'll just have to look at my\nUgly theme all right so here's what\nwe're g to do I'm gonna go ahead and\nstart by naming the theme up at the top\nno one is really going to see this name\nother than internally with inside the\npowerbi desktop so I'm going to call\nthis theme our learn with the Nerds\ntheme okay you can call it whatever you\nwant it's really only going to appear\nthat name only appears inside the\npowerbi desktop your users will not know\nthat then I'm going to change some of\nthe colors so I can change any kind of\ncolor palette that I want here so there\nwas a question earlier can you import\ncolors you really have kind of the world\nas your oyster when it comes to Colors\nbecause when you try and change one of\nthe colors here you'll notice you can\nput in RGB colors you can put in HEX\ncode colors you have lots of options as\nfar as the kind of colors that you can\nselect from here I'm going to go again\nI'm trying to create a pretty uh gnarly\nugly looking theme here I'm going to go\nwith kind of an orange looking color\nhere okay all right so I got an orange\ncolor is going to be my primary color\nused with inside of my theme now you\ncould change the other colors here color\ntwo color three four 5 6 seven eight you\ncould change those if you wanted to we\nreally don't have a need to do that\nyou'll notice we're really only\nleveraging one color inside of our\ndesign here so I'm going to leave it as\ncolor one and then we're going to move\non to some other things now you can also\nchange the text if you go over here on\nthe left hand side you can modify the\ntext options if I go ahead and select\nthat you can standardize the text font\nfamilies that are being used so I could\nchange here this to a different font\ntype by the way a common question is can\nyou select a font type that's not listed\nhere there is a little backdoor way of\ndoing it there's uh it's going to create\na theme file for you that I mentioned is\ncalled a Json file and you could\nactually pass in other font families\nthat are not listed here through that\nJson file so there are some little backd\ndoor ways to even expand beyond the font\nfamilies that are shown here but for the\ntime sake I'm going to go ahead and\nselect\naerial for our font\nfamily all right then I'm going to go\ndown to the visual section on the left\nhand side I'm not covering every element\nof this just kind of highlighting some\nof the brief areas I think are most\ninteresting to you I'm going to go to\nthe visual section here next and I'm\ngoing to add a background color to every\none of my visuals so I'm going to change\nthe color of my background to maybe kind\nof like a gray color here so that means\nevery one of my visuals is going to have\nthis nice little gray background color\nto them okay\nand then I'm also going to change the\nBorder I like adding a border to my\nvisuals it makes it stand out a little\nbit so I'm going to add a border right\nhere and by selecting the Border section\nyou can turn on borders for every one of\nyour visuals so it's going to put a\nborder around your visuals that you can\nchoose from or you can see now one\nproperty here that I particularly like\nis this radius property and what that\nwill do is it will actually show you\nit'll it'll allow you to see like a\nrounded Edge to your border rather than\nlike a sharp right angle like you\ntraditionally see with borders you can\nactually make this kind of like a\nrounded Edge border if you add in some\nkind of pixel or radius here to your\nyour um border that you're creating okay\nthere's lots of other things that we\ncould play around with and change and\nmodify but I'm going to leave it like\nthis I don't want to get too crazy and\nI'm simply going to hit apply down at\nthe bottom okay so I'll hit\napply when I hit apply you'll notice\nthat the theme takes over and it\nreplaces all of the settings that I\nmodified now with the changes that I\nhave from my theme file so we're going\nto see the visuals now following the\nstandards of having a border having a\nbackground color using primary color of\nthis kind of orange color that I'm using\nand it just allows you to again the\npurpose of this is kind of standardize\nthe look and feel for the report design\nthat you've done that's kind of the main\ngoal of creating the theme okay now once\nyou create the theme you can then save\nit you can then share it with others and\nthat way you can make sure that everyone\nin your organization is following the\nsame standards that you've come up with\nokay so if I wanted to export the theme\nthat I've just created I can do that by\ngoing up to the theme area again again\nthis is going to be underneath the view\nthe view menu up top so View and then\nwe're going to expand the theme section\nright\nhere and inside the theme section there\nis a button called save current theme\nright here that's your way of exporting\nthe theme so I would select this to ort\nmy theme it will then allow me to save\nit as a Json file and then I could use\nthat Json file and hand it to other\ncolleagues that I work with and then\nthey would be able to use the same theme\nthat I created so this is how you would\nexport the theme and then one of my\ncolleagues who takes the theme from me\nthe file that I create they would select\nbrowse for theme to then import\nit okay so the three steps we have here\nwe already did this one this was to\ncreate the\ntheme that was step one we created the\ntheme then we can go export it and then\nwhen we hand the exported file to\nsomeone else they can then import it\nusing the browse for theme section right\nthere\nokay all right very cool all right so I\nI wish we had a ton more time to get\ndeeper into the theme section that's\nunfortunately all we're going to have\ntime for because I have a few other\nthings I want to show you but the theme\nare great for creating this\nstandardization across all of your or\nports that you design make sure that\neveryone's following the same standards\nthat you have come up with or that\nsomeone at your organization has come up\nwith to ensure there's there's there's a\nuh wise choices made when it comes to\nthe design pallets that are used here\nokay all right so very good now that we\nhave done that now that we've created a\ntheme one other really fun thing we\ncould do is we can add in background\nimages and we could add in different\ncolors we could add entitles to our\nreport so one of the things that I\nactually have provided to you this is\nreally one of the only things that you\nwill get benefit from with inside of the\nclass files that I provided is I have\ngiven you a background image so Manuel\nif you don't mind sharing the uh share\nthe class files one more time in case\nsomeone did not get the class files from\nearlier the class files have inside of\nthem an image that I've created that can\nbe used as a background to our\nreport and so with inside of those class\nfiles that I provided to you let me\nbring those over here with inside of\nthose class files you'll find that there\nis a completed files\nfolder which includes the example that\nI'm showing you right now there's also a\ncompleted theme and then there's a\nbackground image that I'm going to be\nshowing you here for the next very\nlittle little miniature example that\nwe're going to do so we're going to add\na background image to our report so that\nway we can make this layout a little\nsmoother a little nicer as we go through\nthis next set of\nexamples all right again that's in the\nclass files Manuel has shared a link to\nthose class files in the chat you can\ngrab them\nthere\nokay all right good deal so now what\nwe're going to do is we're going to show\nyou how to implement that background\nimage so if I want to add a background I\ncan do that by first make sure you have\nno visual selected okay so I have no\nvisual selected right now okay\nand if I have no visual selected and by\nthe way I see Linda's question I'm just\ngoing to pop this open for a moment\nbecause it's a quick one to answer Linda\nask how do you reset the theme back to\nthe power to the powerbi theme I would\njust simply come back up to the top here\nLinda and you can select the default\ntheme right here so I would go back up\nto view expand themes and this is the\ndefault one that we started with that\nwill send it back to how it was if you\nwant to revert this back to where you\nstarted uh let me take myself off camera\nso you can actually see that\nbut you'll see that option is right here\nthat's the default theme you started off\nwith and that'll revert You Back by the\nway there's also an undo button in\npowerbi you can go up to the top left\nyou'll find there's an undo button and\nthat will revert you back to what you\nhad before as well it's a good question\nlend I just wanted to make sure I that\nwas a quick one I glanced over and\nsaw all right so background image I want\nto add a background to my report if I\nwant to add a background image to my\nreport I can do that by going over to\nthe format\npane right here now you do before you go\nover here you need to make sure you have\nno visuals selected make sure you don't\nhave any visuals highlighted selected\nbeing used in any way so you'll notice\nright now I have nothing selected how do\nyou know if you go to click on a visual\nyou'll see those little anchor points\naround the edges tell you that you have\na visual selected so I'm going to make\nsure I deselect and have nothing\nselected at the moment and if I go over\nto the format section with nothing\nselected right here if I click on the\nformat button now I can actually add in\na new uh background to my canvas so\nyou'll see there's a section here called\ncanvas background and if I expand that I\nhave the ability to add in a background\nimage right here and I'm going to go\nbrowse to the image that I was showing\nyou just a few moments ago from the\nclass files if you don't have the class\nfiles downloaded right now that's okay\njust use any image doesn't matter I just\nwant you to see the fact that you can\nadd in a back image to your report so\nI'm going to go ahead and browse to add\na file and I'm going to navigate to the\nclass files where I have an image called\nbackground image okay uh good question\nfrom in Ino I'll come to you here in\njust a moment I'm going to go ahead and\nselect background image and hit\nopen now uh Ingo I'm going to come back\nto your question but so I don't forget\nit I'm going to pop it up on my screen\nhere in just a moment actually let me\nstart it so I don't forget your question\nuh but um you'll notice after I add that\nbackground image nothing appears yet and\nthe reason why nothing is appearing is\nbecause this bad boy right here right\nnow the transparency is set to 100%\nwhich means even if I have a background\nimage it's going to be transparent at\n100% which means you're not going to see\nit I don't know why that's the default\nsetting I wish it wasn't but you can\ntaper that down by moving that dial down\nto more like 0% or maybe you make it\nsomething smaller you can kind of figure\nout what transparency makes sense but\n100% transparent means you're not going\nto see it at all so hang keep that in\nmind you don't want it to be 100%\ntransparent the other thing that I'm\ngoing to do is where it says image fit\nimage fit right here it's set to normal\nright now I'm going to change it to fit\nmy image to the the canvas and if you\nchange this to fit instead of Phill or\ninstead of uh the default there notice\nnow we have we're actually able to see\nthe full image when we change it to fit\nto screen rather than it just basically\ntake over the whole interface here so\nusing the fit option which let me show\nyou how I did that one more time we went\nunder the format section we went to\nCanvas background and we changed the\nimage fit here from normal to fit and\nthat made it so we can see the entire\nimage previously the image was kind of\nbeing spilled over into an area we\ncouldn't see okay all right so starting\nto come together looking pretty good so\ningo's question in the chat was around\nwhat's the difference between\nwallpaper and background here what's the\ndifference between these two all right\nso let me promote that question up here\nso you can see so the difference between\nthose two is wallpaper is the continuing\narea beyond the canvas so if you look\nkind of where my arrow is way down here\nthis white space here wallpaper\ncontinues on beyond the canvas space\nwhereas background is only the area that\nyou see in the middle of my screen right\nnow so I used a background so you're\nseeing the background of my report\nchange to be an image wallpaper even\ngoes beyond the canvas into this Whit\nspace area you see lower on as well so\nuh that's the difference there uh why\nwould you use wallpaper versus\nbackground well you might have some\ncircumstances where you you know\nwhenever you're working with inside the\ntool you want to continue to see\nwhatever image it is even Beyond it it's\nreally going to only apply when you're\nin the desktop tool um that's the\nprimary area at least where you'll see\nit you might actually you could see it\nin the the web experience as well just\ndepending on the resolution you have\nturned on so it's basically area Beyond\nwhere you're actually going to have\nvisuals that's the\nwallpaper all right so we have a\nbackground image now that we've used and\nwhat we're eventually going to do is\nwe're going to have some multiple Pages\nhere we can add a nice title up on the\ntop here so if I went to my insert menu\nfor example I could insert a text box I\ngo underneath insert I could select\ntextbox and I could put a title up up\ntop of my report so I can go up to the\ninsert menu and insert a text\nbox and I can kind of shift that text\nbox around and add some text to it so\nmaybe we add in something like report I\ngot my cap lock on I could add in\nsomething like report\nsummary and I can make that bold and I\ncan make it really look like a a header\nto my report here if I wanted to and so\nthat way we are able to add a little bit\nof nice aesthetic changes to our report\nso it's a little nicer here and I'm just\nmaking some aesthetic changes here but I\ncan grab this now move it up to the top\nyou could even remove the Border in the\nbackground if you wanted to so it\ndoesn't have that uh border around it\nlike we did for our visuals but here I'm\nable to now kind of add some of the\nfinal touches here to our report\nokay so easy enough to do if you want to\nadd in something like a a text box you\nwould simply go up to insert text\nbox okay\nall right very good so the next thing I\nwant to show is custom visuals so custom\nvisuals are a fun part of powerbi that\nallow you to extend beyond the standard\nvisuals that are given to you over here\nso you have these visuals are provided\nto you by default but you can actually\ngo explore other visuals that are\navailable to you beyond the default ones\nhere in fact there's there's more than\n450 custom visuals that you can explore\nand we're going to show you one just\ngive you a little bit of a exposure into\ncustom visuals but custom visuals allow\nyou again for the purpose uh the purpose\nof them is to extend beyond the basic\nvisuals that are provided to you now\ncustom visuals are provided and are\navailable by going to a website called\nappsource app source is where all of the\ncustom visuals can be found but you can\nalso navigate to find the custom visuals\nby clicking on the little three dot menu\nfound right here okay so if I click on\nthat little three dot menu the more get\nmore visuals menu you'll see that when I\ngo to click on that little three dot\nmenu right here there is there are a\ncouple options for how you can bring in\nadditional visuals and we're going to\nchoose the option right here called get\nmore visuals now I will tell you some of\nyou will be prevented from being able to\ndo this your company could stop and\nprevent you from using custom visuals so\nif you do hit a roadblock here I don't\nwant you to get too hung up on this one\nlittle demo just watch this one if you\nif you do do hit a roadblock it I want\nit to ruin the rest of your class but do\nknow that some organizations block\ncustom visuals for whatever reason\ncompanies have their reasons for doing\nthat uh but you will be prompted to sign\nin to your powerbi account to have\naccess to the custom visuals and when\nyou go to sign in powerbi will know\nwhether or not your organization has\nblocked you from Custom visuals so just\na heads up on that all right so we're\ngoing to go ahead and select get more\nvisuals right\nhere and when I select get more visuals\nit's going top pop open on my screen in\nthe middle of my screen where I can\nsearch through all of the custom visuals\nthat are available to me and again\nthere's more than 450 visuals you can\nchoose from here there's lots of\ndifferent visuals that you can find okay\nso what I'd like to do is I want to add\nin the play access Visual right here and\nif you don't see it on your screen you\ncould always search in the top right as\nwell but we're going to add in the play\naccess Visual found right\nhere so I'm going to select the play\naccess\nand Matt I see your question happen to\nglance over and saw Matt's question Matt\nask can background can the background\nimage be part of the theme as well\nunfortunately not uh if you want to have\na background image that's kind of\nconsistently part of your solution you\nmight want to look into something called\npowerbi templates it's a little bit\ndifferent than themes themes don't\nsupport background images as of today\nthough all right so here's what we're\ngoing to do I'm going to go ahead and\nselect that I want to add this play\naccess Visual right\nhere and that will allow me to then uh\nsee this report change over time so\nbasically here's what the play access\nVisual does it allows you to animate\nyour report so you can build in\nanimations and you can see how things\nchange in your report over time so if\nyou actually want to see year-over-year\nhow your reports have changed or how\nyour data sets your data set has changed\nyear-over-year you can use something\nlike the play access that allows you to\nclick a play button and you'll actually\nsee changes occurring over time so I'm\ngoing to go ahead and select the play or\nthe add button\nhere and you'll notice over on the right\nhand side that there is now a new visual\nthat has been added right here the play\naccess Visual is now available to me and\nI can start to use this visual inside of\nmy report\nokay all\nright uh Nick has a good relevant\nquestion let me go ahead and promote\nNick's question here for a moment Nick\nasked the question once you add a visual\nwill it always be your visualization\narea or will it need to be reloaded uh\ndo you need to reload the visual for\ndifferent reports so great question Nick\nthe default behavior of how this works\nis the custom visual that we added is\nonly available in this powerbi file that\nwe're looking at right now by default so\nthe default behavior is if I were to\nsave this file close and go open another\nfile I would not see that custom visual\nhowever you can change that and I see\nsome good comments in the chat answering\nNick's question as well but if I wanted\nto change that so that that visual is\npermanently available to me you can\nright click on the visual and you can\nselect pin to visualizations pan and so\nthis is answering Nick's question that\nyou're seeing on my screen right now\nthis would allow you to be able to make\nthat visual permanent with inside of\nyour powerbi desktop so it's specific to\nyou uh if you had other users they went\nto open up their powerbi desktop it's\nnot pinned for them but this does allow\nyou to make it so that that visual is\nthere for you always and then and a\nfollowup to that is Marty's question so\nMarty asked uh how do you then let me\nput Marty's question up here how do you\nthen uh remove a visual so if I go to\npin a visual how do I later remove it\nwell if I go to pin a visual which I\njust did if I pin that visual I can\nlater remove it by right clicking on it\nand selecting unpin this Visual and\nyou'll see it kind of goes back and\nforth below and above this little dotted\nline here that's how you add or remove a\ncustom visual right click to pin it\nright click to unpin it if you don't\nwant it to be permanently there okay\ngood\nquestions all right let me go ahead and\nunpin that question Perfect all right so\ngood deal so now that we have added in\nthe play access let's actually see it in\naction if I want to add the play access\nVisual to my report I can do that by\ngoing to select it over with inside of\nthe visualizations pane right here so\nI'm going to select the play AIS visual\nthat we just added a few moments ago\nagain make sure you have no other visual\nselected when you do this if I have\nanother visual selected when I add in\nthe play access it's going to replace\nthe visual that I'm trying to use rather\nthan edit the visual uh so I what I want\nto do is I want a totally new visual I'm\ngoing to make sure that I click\nsomewhere in the background somewhere in\nthe white space so no visuals are added\nand then I'll go ahead and click the\nplay access\nVisual with the play access Visual\nselected I'm going to bring this over\nand shift it in into place and you can\nreally shape it or size it however you\nwant that's up to you but now with\ninside of this new play access Visual\nI'm going to bring into it my year\ncolumn from the calendar table so what\nwe're going to do is from the calendar\ntable right here we're going to bring in\nthe year column and drag and drop that\ninto the field list for the play\naccess and this will allow me to\nactually see how things Chang year by\nyear with the number of failed banks\nthat we have okay all right so if I go\nahead and select year now notice what\nhappened so now I can see there's this\nnice little visual in the bottom right\nhand corner for me I can hit play on\nthat and now you might sometimes by the\nway you have to hit it twice so I'm\ngonna hit it a second time here now when\nI hit a second time it'll actually show\nme how things have changed over time\nwith inside of my report so in the early\n2000s there wasn't a whole lot of\ndifferent uh banks that were failing but\nthen you can see kind of 2009 2010 20 11\nrange that's when there was a lot of\nfail banks that were occurring and you\nsee a big influx in the number of failed\nbanks that appear in that range and so\nif you pay close attention let me go\nahead and play that again you'll see the\nbig influx occur around that 2009 2010\nRange is where the most banks really\nstarted to appear with ins side of our\nvisuals there we go right there you can\nsee 2009 you can see it highlight is\nshow the highlighted value is showing us\nthere's 25 failed banks of the total 93\noccurred in the year 2009 so a really\nreally neat visual it allows you to\nbuild in animations into your report it\nallows you to build more interactive\nreport visuals by using things like this\nplay access Visual and the play access\nVisual is just one of hundreds uh like I\nmentioned there's more than 450 custom\nvisuals that are available to you this\nis just one there's lots of other ones\nthat are worth exploring as well\nokay all right so we got 15 more minutes\nso I have a couple things I want to show\nyou I'm going to tell you this this next\nthing I'm going to show show you I'm\ngoing to do to fast for you to follow\nalong with at least to follow along with\nme live so I'm telling you that because\nthis is a recording you can go back and\nyou can slow me down but I really want\nyou to see this next feature it's really\ncool I think you'll it it has a wow\nfactor to it that I want you to see uh\nbut I'm noticing we're getting low on\ntime here so I'm telling you that just\nto let you know that you can rewatch\nthis this is recorded you can go back\nand Rewind me and watch this next\nsection again because I'm going to have\nto do it a little fast uh for the time\nwe have left\nso the next thing that I'm going to show\nyou that that's going to be fast is\ncalled report page tool tips report page\ntool tips are a feature that replaces\nthe standard tool tip you see right here\nokay report page tool tips can replace\nthis little feature that you're seeing\nthis is what's known as a tool tip right\nhere okay a tool tip is basically a\nhover over whenever you got to hover\nover data a data point it will show you\nthe value that's represented by that\ndata point and what a report page tool\ntip does is it allows you to replace\nthat gray box that we saw pop up right\nhere with a box of your own design you\ncan replace it entirely with something\ntotally different and the way that you\ndo it is you you create your own your\nown page now we haven't really talked\nabout this yet but down on the bottom\nhere you can actually have multiple\npages of reports that you can add right\nnow we're looking at page one but you\ncan actually have more than one page to\nyour report by hitting the little plus\nsign here it looks very much like adding\nanother Excel spreadsheet right right so\nwhat we're going to do is we're going to\nactually add in another page you'll see\nwe have a new blank canvas here now when\nwe do that we can always toggle back to\npage one so here's page one here's page\ntwo by the way you can also rename these\nPages if you wanted to you can rename\nthem by double clicking on the page name\nhere and you can give them a new\nname like so I can call this my tool tip\npage and you can have multiple names to\nyour multiple pages and they can have\ndifferent names for each one of them\nhere okay all right so what we're going\nto do is now that we have created a\nsecond page we're going to make this new\npage turn into a tool tip okay and the\nway that we do that is we're going to go\nover to the format section and\nunderneath Page information again I'm\ngoing to be doing this a little fast so\nyou can always rewind me and watch this\nagain later but underneath the format\nsection we're going to turn on allow use\nas tool tip and so I'm going to go ahead\nand turn that on notice it resizes the\ncanvas to something far smaller that's\nmore of an appropriate tool tip size\nthere and then what I'm going to do is\nI'm going to add some visuals to it so\nI'm going to add something like a card\nvisual this would be the card visual\nright here I'm G to add a card visual to\nthis report and I'm going to put in a\nmeasure for total Banks so show me the\ntotal number of banks with inside of\nthis little popup we're trying to create\nI'm also going to add in a map and\ninside the\nmap okay inside the map that I'm going\nto do I'm going to bring in the total\nnumber of banks by city\nstate okay so the location is going to\nbe city state here's what we did we\nbrought in city state into the location\nand Bank name into the bubble size\nhere now one thing that's worth\nnoting Maps do have some security\nfeatures that could be turned off for\nyou so if you see an error on top of\nyour map it could be one of two things\nthere is a setting underneath the file\nand options menu with inside of powerbi\nwhere you can turn off a security\nsetting that will allow maps to work uh\nManuel may be able to go kind of give\nyou a little bit of path of how to get\nto that that would take me a few moments\nto show but there is an option to turn\noff the security setting to allow maps\nto work uh that's something you can turn\noff in the powerbi desktop if this isn't\nworking for you for some reason the\nother thing that you may consider doing\nis it could be something that your\norganization has turned off at the\ntenant level so it may be something that\nyour administrator needs to help you\nwith as well so there's two things to\ncheck if the map doesn't work for you\none is it could be a setting in your\npowerbi desktop the other is it could be\nsomething that your tenant admin has\nturned off for your whole company but\nwhat I'm going to do is with my map\nadded mine is working I'm going to add\ninto my map the city state column which\nyou actually I already did add it in but\nyou'll notice that none of my city\nstates are actually mapping it's not\nactually showing any anything on my map\nat the moment so what I'm need to do\nthere's a there's a special feature that\nI need to turn on it's called Data\ncategories and by flipping on a data\ncategory for the citystate column it's\ngoing to let powerbi know that we're\ntalking about a particular location\nright now when we pass in our citystate\ncolumn it doesn't recognize it as a\ngeographic field and so we're going to\nneed to tell powerbi that citystate is\nactually a geographic field that we want\nto be able to show on our map\nso the way that we're going to do that\nis we're going to first start by\nselecting the citystate column just\nclick on the column name not the check\nbox and with the column selected we're\nthen going to go up to column tools like\nwe did earlier so column tools right\nhere and you'll see there's a property\nhere called Data category that's set to\nuncategorize but we're going to change\nthis to place the reason we're not\nselecting city is because remember our\ncity state column actually has the city\nand state in it and so City wouldn't be\nrecognized properly here so we're going\nto use the place value and by selecting\nthe place value Watch What Happens in\nour map look at that now all of the data\npoints are finally now being mapped\ninside of our report visual because we\nhave told powerbi that citystate is\nactually a geographic field\nokay all right good deal so now that\nwe've done that there's one final step\nto make this work and the one final step\nthat we need to do is there is a\nproperty on the report page right here\ncalled tool tip and we need to bring a\nfield into the tool tip section that\nlets powerbi know how to filter this\ntool tip down now the column that we're\ngoing to be using for our example is\ngoing to be the state column because\nwhat we want to do is we want to make it\nso that anytime someone goes to build a\nreport visual if it's using the state\ncolum we want this tool tip to pop up so\nwe're going to drag and drop the state\ncolumn into the tool tip section by\nsimply dragging that into the tool tip\narea and again what that means is any\nvisual that uses the state column will\nhave access to this tool tip and it will\nfilter to only show the state that you\nhappen to be hovering over so this is a\nlittle bit more of an advanced feature\nfor sure but I think it's a wow factor\nthing I really want you to see so let's\ngo ahead and drag in the state column\ninto the tool tip area and we're done so\nI know I did that pretty fast but let's\nsee the end result of what we just did\nyeah it does does kind of act like a a\ndrill through uh see for that question\nthat came in the chat it's kind of like\na drill through at least how you set it\nup but it's done a little differently\nthe the behavior is a little different\nso let's go back over to our report\nsummary now our original report and\nwatch what happens now when we go to\nhover above State now when I go to hover\nabove State you'll see it pops up not\nthat gray box we saw earlier now we're\nactually seeing a number our tool tip we\ncreated with inside of it and a map so\nwe actually do see a map showing us each\nof the state where those failed Banks\nwere occurring now with inside of our\ntool tip we' created so this is called\nreport page tool tips it's a really neat\nfeature and it delivers a little bit of\na wow factor where you can see that you\ncan go beyond the basic gray box that we\nsaw here so this was what we saw before\nright we saw this gray box now we're\nseeing this much more responsive uh\nreport page tool tip that gives you a\nmuch neater view now it's a little bit\nmore of an advanced feature but again\ndon't forget this is recorded go back\nand watch this video again this portion\nof the video again to see all the little\nclicks that I did to make that happen\nOkay I want you to see that one I'm\nseeing a lot of great responses in the\nchat because it is really a neat feature\nso I wanted to make sure you could at\nleast see the the punchline even if I\nhad to do it a little fast uh because it\nis such a really really really cool\nfeature all right very good so we're\ndown to our last few minutes here and\nwhat we're going to be doing in our last\ncouple minutes is I want to show you\nwhat do you do with this next what's the\nnext steps that we would do\nuh one of the things I wanted to show\nyou with a little bit more time and\nmaybe I'll give you a little peek at it\nis you can also build in navigation into\nyour reports so if you wanted to build\nin let's say for example buttons you\nyou'll notice I left a lot of space here\non the Le hand side because I wanted to\nbuild in the capability to have buttons\nthat your users could click on to go\nfrom report to report very briefly let\nme show you how that could be done if I\nwanted to build in navigation into my\nreports for my users then I can go up to\nthe insert menu\nand I'll zoom in on this here for you in\na moment but under the insert menu right\nhere this is definitely worth exploring\nlater on your own underneath the button\nsection here you'll see there's an\noption here called Navigator and there\nyou can build in buttons for your users\nto click so it will allow them to hop\nfrom page to page so if I were to\nactually do this on my screen I don't\nreally have very much for them to hop\nback and forth between in fact you'll\nsee it really only creates one button\nfor me\nbut I could take that button and I can\nmove it over here on the right hand side\nnow it will automatically create a\nbutton for you for every page that you\nhave now the reason you're only seeing\none button is because powerbi is smart\nenough to realize you probably don't\nwant to have a button for the tool tip\nyou don't want users to go to that tool\ntip page but if I were to add another\npage here check this out I added another\npage now I have another button so it'll\ncreate as many buttons as you have Pages\nunless they're tool tips it actually\nhides the tool tip Pages for you\nautomatically and if you wanted to\nchange the orientation of this you can\nso I can actually change this so that it\nis uh rotated let's see it\nis style here it is there's a button\nthere's a way that you can actually\nchange this here here we go vertical so\nnow I can kind of have buttons on the\nleft hand side going down the left hand\nside where I'm building this navigation\nand it allows you to kind of toggle back\nand forth between all of the pages you\nhave on your report so by adding in that\nwas again under the insert menu an\ninsert button Navigator you can select\nthe page Navigator and it will\nautomatically create a button for you\nfor every page you have on your report\nallowing your users to very easily\nnavigate between each of the pages you\nhave so that's a great strategy for you\nknow building in that almost like a\nwebsite looking feel right so Daniel\nasked a good question Daniel ask how is\nthis different than bookmarks so this\nactually doesn't rely on bookmarks at\nall\nthe what I'm showing now with the the\nbutton option it's almost doing what you\nwould have in the past manually created\nwith bookmarks so bookmarks can do the\nsame thing this just makes it a lot\neasier so you don't have to build Book\nbookmarks on your own uh it actually\njust allows you to kind of take care of\num uh it allows you to build in the\nnavigation without without you having to\nmanually create the bookmarks so they\nthey saw uh the powerbi team saw so many\npeople were doing the same thing with\nbuilding out navigation that they went\nahead and built that into the product\nitself all right very good good question\nall right the final thing the last few\nminutes we have here that I want to show\nthe final step here that I want to get\nacross to you is what do you do with\nthis next and we're definitely down to\nthe wire here on time we got about five\nminutes left uh but the final thing I\nwant to show you is what do I do with\nthe solution once I'm done and what\nyou're going to do is you're going to\npublish and share your work with others\nand this will definitely be a micro\nsession here but under your Home tab so\nyou're going to go to home first\nand under the Home tab with inside the\npowerbi desktop you'll find a publish\nbutton right here by selecting publish\nthis will allow you to share your work\nwith others by publishing to the powerbi\nservice so if I select and click on the\npublish button it's going to prompt me\nfirst to save my work I have yet to save\nmy work so it's going to ask me to save\nmy work locally so I'll save that and\nI'll call this my learn with the\nNerds live session here and hit save\nand so I've saved my work locally and\nnow I can publish to the powerbi service\nthis is the cloud part of powerbi here\nokay now each of you are likely going to\nhave different workspaces you can\npublish to so a workspace is basically\nlike a folder that you publish your\npowerbi content to but what everyone\nshould have assuming you have a powerbi\naccount is everyone will have a my\nworkspace and your my workspaces where\nyou can kind of do like your own\npersonal testing and you can you know\nvalidate that the things are going to\nlook the way they should in the web\nbrowser that they do elsewhere but your\nmy workspace is kind of like for your\nown personal testing when you want to\nreally publish to somewhere that you\nwill share with others you'll likely\nhave another workspace you create so I\nthink I have one here called learn with\nthe Nerds I'm going to go ahead and\nselect learn with the Nerds is my\nworkspace and it's going to publish now\nto the powerbi service which is going to\nbe found from with inside of the web\nbrowser experience so with a little bit\nof time we have left I'm going to click\non open learn with the Nerds live inside\nof the power the powerbi service which\nis going to open in my web browser\nexperience and you'll see here this is\nthe same experience that we had in the\ndesktop tool now appearing with inside\nof the web browser experience okay so\nthis allows you to now see the same\nreport that we did in the desktop tool\nnow available inside of the powerbi\nservice and you're able to interact with\nit just like you could from with inside\nof the desktop tool but now you're\ninside of the web experience now there's\nloads more to talk about here as far as\nhow do you share your work with others\nhow do you schedule data refreshes\nthere's lots more here to learn about\nthat for unfortunately we're just out of\ntime uh to go any deeper into but\nthere's lots of sharing options that you\ncan do in fact you'll even see that you\ncan share from the report directly right\nhere uh there's other ways of sharing\nwhere you can share to a workspace or\nyou can share to a powerbi app uh what I\nwould recommend you may want to take a\npeek at is menwell who's joined us today\nhe actually did a webinar on powerbi\nAdministration that was another\nthree-hour one where he went pretty in\ndepth into a lot of the topics that we\nhave on my screen right now and I will\nput uh if if he doesn't have that\nhandy I'll put it in the chat for you uh\nas well so that way if you want to learn\nmore about the administration side of\nthings with powerbi I'm going to put a\nlink to his lengthier webinar uh\nthree-hour webinar\non Administration I'm going to put that\nin the chat for you so that way you can\ngo back and learn more about powerbi\nAdministration\nall right very good so the final thing I\nwant to mention for you again this is\nwhere you would go next you would share\nyour work here there's lots more to\nlearn of what to do next watch that\nthree-hour link I put in the chat just\nnow around powerbi Administration the\nway I want to wrap up with you though is\nI do want to let you know that uh first\nof all we do have another event coming\nup I'm sure my my marketing team folks\nwill add this into the chat we have a\nanother lunch with the Nerds which is\nour shorter sessions is coming up on let\nme go pull it up on my screen here we\nhave another lunch with the Nerds that's\ncoming up\non March 8th so if you look at our\nYouTube channel on March 8th with\nAllison Gonzalez we have a lunch with\nthe Nerds which means it's a shorter\nsession it's an hour and a half and it's\ngoing to be coming up on March 8th at 11\na.m. okay that's going to be on data\nstorytelling with powerbi so she's going\nto focus even more on some of the\nstorytelling features that I wish we had\nmore time to cover today today she's\ngoing to really dig into that on that\nhour and a half session she's also going\nto talk about some methodologies around\ndata storytelling she is actually has a\ndesign background so she really has a\nlot of expertise around designing your\nreports so uh my team has it looks like\nhas already shared in the chat a link to\nwhere you can sign up for that so make\nsure that you take a moment and sign up\nfor the lunch with the nerd session\ncoming up on March 8th uh we'll also be\nsending out some follow-up information\nif you have questions again about the\nboot camps uh I'll put the the\ninformation about the boot camp sale\nthat we have going on up on the screen\nhere again but other than that thank you\nso much everyone for joining hopefully\nyou enjoyed today's session don't forget\nit was recorded you can go back and\nrewatch certain portions of it if\nthere's something that you missed\nsomething that you want to go back and\nsee again take a moment and go ahead and\nRewind me and watch it again thanks\neverybody have a great rest of your week\nand thanks for joining today take care\n",
