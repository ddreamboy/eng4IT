  "text": "hello there welcome to this video on\nusing the IOT communication protocols in\nthis video we're gonna see an IOT device\ncommunication scenario we also gonna see\nhow an IOT microchip should look like\nand what are its characteristics we're\ngonna see one of the protocols they use\nfor general-purpose communication we\nwill also emphasize on the protocols\nsuitable for IOT devices alright let's\nget started now the first thing we want\nestablished is the edge devices now edge\ndevices are basically your IOT endpoints\nnow these could be your IOT devices your\nsensors your development boards and so\non and on a large perspective these\ndevices are categorized into two large\ncategories one is the consumer IOT\ndevices and the other one is the\nembedded IOT devices of course there\ncould be other categories as well now\nthe consumer IOT devices are basically\nyour nest thermostats your home\nautomation IOT devices your smart shirts\nyour smart utilities all of these will\ncome under consumer IOT devices\nthe Embera dietary devices are the ones\nwhich are living deep inside machines\nwhich live on independent sensors and in\nother use cases like in the shell IOT in\nsmart manufacturing and so on all right\nnow we know what is an edge device and\ntwo different categories now the whole\npoint of an IOT device is that it should\nestablish communication to the Internet\nand before the device establishes a\nconnection to the Internet it first\ntalks to a local area network so those\nare your lands bands using wired or\nwireless like Bluetooth Wi-Fi or you\ncould also use a powerline so depending\non your scenario your use case you can\nuse different methods to communicate to\na local area network so this will\nessentially become somewhat of a gateway\nto talk to the world wide web or the\nInternet so from that\npoint you communicate to the Internet so\non the internet so you're either\ncommunicating to an Internet of Things\nplatform like for example thing works\nperiods iBM has one cisco has one many\nof them have a iot platform today or you\nare communicating to an application\nbuilt specifically for your set of\ndevices or your device could be\ncommunicating to other cloud services ok\nnow once your devices are connected to\nthe Internet for whatever reason and to\nwhatever platform then there's a set of\nactivities which go on the first is you\nacquire the data you derive value from\nthe data and you enable the end-users to\ntake some action so finally on this side\nit is used at the end user area so who\nare you end users so it could be a\ncompany which wants to derive an\nanalytics which wants to take decisions\nwhich wants to automate things which\nwants to make certain processes smart\nand efficient it could be end users like\nyou and me using a phone application to\nswitch on and switch off your devices at\nhome or it crawls would be other sensors\nand machines using this information now\nlet's zoom on the edge device and the\nlocal network area so next device could\ndirectly connect to the internet after a\nset of ISB layers or it could first\ncommunicate to a gateway and then the\nGateway can communicate to the internet\nor different gateways can communicate to\na local cloud or an intra cloud and this\ncloud can actually communicate to your\nout your platform living on internet or\nany other service living on the Internet\nso the multiple ways how your s devices\ncould land up communicating within\nthemselves and with the internet now\nlet's look at the characteristics of a\nmicrochip which could be used to power\nan IOT device the first thing is the\npower so it should be consuming low\npower as much as possible because these\nmicrochips will be living in devices\nwhich will be mostly in remote locations\nor as a part of\nmachine or as a part of a sensor so in\nmost times conventional way of powering\nthis device is not possible so you could\nbe relying on batteries and hence you\nshould be using low-power it should be\nlow-cost because the application is wide\nand heavy so you could be needing plenty\nof these to actually make sense of the\nsolution and it should have a good range\nso that it can communicate with other\ndevices or to a gateway or to a router a\ncouple of offerings today in the market\nare by admin by armed by intent of\ncourse there are other plays as well\nthese are some of the top ones so Intel\nhas chips like Adam quark arm has a\ncomplete cortex-m series and that will\nhas its own set of microchips now these\nare the hardware players companies like\nmicrochip they use an ARM Cortex chip\nand they add the software layer on top\nof it another player in the market is\ncalled particle particle also uses the\nARM Cortex chip and it has its own IOT\nplatform which the chip is automatically\nprogrammed to hook up to so the whole\nplumbing is solved by particles so it's\nvery easy for the develop to develop and\nI have the application and to provision\nit in a relatively short amount of time\nof course there is a cost factor to it\nlast but not the least you have the\ndevelopment platforms like Arduino and\nRaspberry Pi which allow you to learn\nIOT and of course you can also use these\ndevelopment platforms in some\napplications but most likely not in\nproduction for consumer use development\nplatforms are very friendly they have\nthe microchips and they have the\nsoftware and they have other protocols\nbuilt in it they make it easy for you to\ncommunicate with them and make it easy\nfor you to power them so you can power\nthem with USB another\nplenty of features which a development\nboard should have now let's take a look\nat the IOT device communication\nprotocols in other words this is the\nsoftware part of the equation\nprotocols currently available today are\nwritten for general purpose devices\nthey're not written for devices with\nconstraints like the IOT devices so\nnaturally they use more power they send\nmore data in the same sample because the\nheader repeats in every transfer and\nother overheads it takes more time to\nsend the data because you tend to use a\nlot of layers of software and naturally\nit uses more RAM and ROM space now a\ntypical protocol on IOT space should use\nminimum power it should send less data\nfor the same sample so it should manage\nits header space nicely then it should\nalso reduce the overhead it should take\nless time to send data it should manage\nits sleeping time nicely so that they\ncan consume the power it should have\nvery less lightweight layers of software\nwhich is essential for the device and of\ncourse it should need less RAM and ROM\nspace because of the space constraints\nlet's take a side-by-side look of\nprotocols for general purpose in IOT\nspecific scenarios in the internet and\nnetwork layer we could switch to 6lowpan\nwhich is basically a low-power wireless\npersonal area network which understands\nipv6 we could switch to UDP which has\nmuch less low overhead compared to TCP\non the web transfer layer we could use\nco-op which works on top of UDP and has\nmuch less overhead compared to HTTP on\nthe application layer we could use\nexisting technologies like REST API x'\nJSON objects and so on let's take a look\nat some existing technologies which can\nbe used in high addition areas in the\nnetwork layer you have ZigBee which has\nbeen there for a while it's used for\nlocal area network communication and\nZigBee IP understands ipv6 z-wave is\nsimilar to ZigBee and it is somewhat\nproprietary in nature coming to the web\nand application layer we have MQTT which\nuses a publish and subscribe model it is\nvery lightweight and can be used for IOT\napplications you have WebSocket which is\ndeveloped by the\nmy consortium it has a full duplex open\nsocket communication and it saw as much\nof the complexity around client-server\ncommunication\nyou also have XMPP which specializes in\ninstant chat peer-to-peer communication\none-to-many communication and it can be\nextended for other scenarios as well of\ncourse this is not a comprehensive list\nand there are many other technologies\nout there which can be used for high\nedition hires in the next video we're\ngonna be testing or do we know uno\nEthernet board and nor MCU thank you\n",
