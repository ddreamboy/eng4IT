  "text": "[Music]\nlet me go ahead and start the recording\nyou should be able to see my screen\nright now you should be looking at\num\ndesigning a data warehouse from the\nground up you see that okay liz\nyes you're good\nokay great i'm gonna go ahead and uh\nwe'll get started here\nokay so\nwelcome everybody i'm very happy that\nyou guys are joining us here for this\nsession this session is designing a data\nwarehouse from the ground up\nmyself dustin ryan i'm\njoined here by mitchell pearson\nwe're two business intelligence\nconsultants here at pragmatic works and\nso we're going to be taking you through\ndesigning a data warehouse from the\nground up which includes the steps that\nwe're going to use some things to\nconsider\nand then we're also going to\nspecifically point out some things\nregarding\num\nan analysis services some considerations\nthat you just want to keep in the back\nof your head when you're designing your\ndata warehouse for analysis services\nnow if you're not um if you're not going\nto be using analysis services for your\ndata warehouse that's okay you're still\nin the right place we're just going to\npoint out some extra things along the\nway for those of you in the audience\nthat will be\nlooking to leverage\nthe really the strengths the reporting\nstrengths of analysis services\nokay\nall right so my co-presenter today is\nsequel dusty.com or dustin's sequel or\ndustin ryan there we go he's been at\npragmatic works for eight years now now\nwhat you might not know is he spent the\nfirst six and a half years\nas the janitor but fortunately for him\nhe's learned a lot in the last year and\na half and he is a bi consultant here at\npragmatic works he's also a trainer he\nteaches our ssas master's class our own\ndx class he's a wealth of knowledge if\nyou go to his blog you'll see he has\nover 100 blogs on just those two topics\nhe is an author a blogger and a speaker\nhe's written two books you'll see them\non your screen here and he is also a\ntrainer of miniature ponies i can't make\nthis stuff up they're so cute they're so\nprecious\num and this here to my left here is\nmitchell pearson he's also a bi\nconsultant and trainer of pragmatic\nworks\nhe teaches the intro to ssis class he\nalso teaches the ssis master's class so\nhe knows a lot more about me than ssis\ngreat resource there so if you have any\nquestions about ssis you definitely need\nto look up mitch\nhe's a blogger speaker um and he's\nreally has this you know very\nuncomfortable and natural passion about\nmodel trains um\nuh he's got costumes and everything so i\ndon't want to go too much detail into it\nbut\nthrow that out there and you can find\nhis blog mitchellsql.wordpress.com\nall right\nso\nwe're going to get started with talking\nabout um before we get into designing a\ndata warehouse why do we want a data\nhouse so mitch can you think of any good\nreasons why we might want a data\nwarehouse\nactually i'll give you a little story i\nlike stories i like stories too once\nupon a time there was a little bank\nand this bank wanted to build these\nreally awesome reports but unfortunately\nthey\nhey you guys can hear me you just lost\nsound\nguys\nhey\nwe're having some audio\nyeah\ncan you hear us okay\nthere you go\nall right i'm not sure what the issue is\nexcellent so we were telling a little\nstory i'll start over from the beginning\nhere once upon a time there was little\nbank and this bank wanted to have these\nawesome reports for analysis but\nunfortunately they didn't have a data\nwarehouse and this is a true story we\nwon't name the bank and this bank built\nthese reports off of their transactional\nsystem and unfortunately when they built\nthese reports off their transactional\nsystem their transactional system\ncrashed and it took down all of the atms\nfor the bank the end\nokay so what you're telling me is that\nsomebody went home early that day\npermanently permanently okay so that\nthat is one really good reason why a\ndata warehouse is something that you\nwant right for reporting right\nhistorical reporting you know there's\ncertain reports that you definitely\ndon't want to be running off of your\ndata warehouse\num now\nso that's a kind of a scary story but\nthose kinds of things happen\nand so that's that's one of the really\ngood reasons why we want to consider\nusing a data warehouse\nnow when we're talking about data data\nreally boils down to two different types\nyou have data that supports the\nexecution of the business and then you\nhave data that supports the analysis of\nthe business so when we're talking about\ndata that supports the execution of the\nbusiness\nit can be you know a retail business it\ncan be a banking it can be\ntransportation energy manufacturing it\ncan be any type of business and we have\ndata that supports the business so\nsomebody is buying products somebody is\nlogging inventory somebody's doing\nsomething that helps the business run\nhelps the business make money so that's\nthe execution side of the business then\nwe have the analysis of the business how\nmany cheese balls did we sell last\nquarter what are the account balances\nthat we're looking at right now how much\nfreight did we ship or how much freight\nare we going to ship so that's the\nanalysis side of the business and so\nthat's two of the main differences\nbetween the oltp or your transactional\nsystem and your data warehouse your\ndimensional model your star schema\nwhatever you want to call it\nthat's the analysis side of the business\nso\nhuge differences there between the\ntransactional system and the data\nwarehouse\nalso um you have how does the user\ninteract with that with those two\ndifferent systems that that's another\nbig difference between the systems\nso when you have a transactional system\nprimarily the interaction is going to be\nat a very atomic level or a very\ngranular level somebody's going to\ninsert a new transaction a customer\nwalks into a store\nthey buy a product they say give me a\ncheese ball\nwe insert a record into the database\ninto the transactional database because\nsome a new customer has bought another\ncheeseball\nokay that's the transactional side now\nwith the data warehouse side\nthe transactions are going to be a lot\ndifferent right we want to be able to\nupload\nall of yesterday's transactions which\ncould be 50 million 100 million whatever\nthe number might be we want to insert\nall 50 million transactions from\nyesterday up into the data warehouse so\nthat way we can begin reporting for\nreporting on it\num now it could also be we want to read\na 50 million record so i can figure out\nhow many cheese balls did i sell\nyesterday\nso the user interaction is going to be\ndifferent now the the method of\ninteraction or the types of queries that\nare going to be run are also going to\nlook a lot different when we're talking\nabout a transactional system\nyou're going to have\natomic inserts atomic updates deletes\nwe're going to insert one record at a\ntime update one record at a time delete\none record at a time and the primary\nmethod of interaction with the data\nwarehouse is going to be is going to be\nselect you're gonna have yes you're\ngonna have inserts bulk inserts right\nwe're gonna insert 100 million records\nat one time from you know whatever\nhappened yesterday in the business or\nwe're going to select 100 million\nrecords at a time because our users are\nrunning queries that are going to that\nthey're asking um show me how many sales\ni have show me how many how many sales\ntransactions i had yesterday or how many\ncheese balls i i sold yesterday those\ntypes of queries\nanother difference between your\ntransactional system and your data\nwarehouse is going to be the temporal\nfocus right usually in a transactional\nsystem the temporal focus is going to be\nwhat's happening now currently in the\nbusiness we're not tracking a lot of\nhistory in the business um outside of\nwhat's necessary just to keep the\nbusiness running\nwith the data warehouse\nwe're going to have what's going on\ncurrently right and there may be a\nlittle bit of latency there maybe we're\nonly keeping\nmaybe there's like a day latency we\nupdate the data warehouse daily and so\nit takes a little time\nfor the the current data to make its way\ninto the data warehouse\nbut we also keep history right you maybe\nyou want to keep three five ten years\nhistory you know i don't know whatever\nyour business determines is appropriate\nyou wanna keep that history in your data\nwarehouse as well so that way we can do\nanalysis over over time so are we\nselling more cheese balls this year than\nwe sold three years ago\nnow\nalso the difference between the\ntransactional system and the data\nwarehouse is going to be the design\noptimization right\ntypically with a transactional system\nyou use a third normal form type of\ndesign because we want to be able to\noptimize\nlots of inserts happening at one time so\nwe may have you know 10 000\n10 000 uh purchase orders coming in\nin a given hour and so we want to be\nable to you know insert and update those\nall at the same time\nthat's how we'll optimize our\ntransactional system now with the data\nwarehouse\nwe want to optimize for high performance\nqueries and that's really\nthe main purpose of designing the data\nwarehouse the way that we're going to\ntalk about is we want to be able to get\nthe data out of the data warehouse as\nfast as humanly possible\nso that way our users queries don't have\nto run very very long\nthis is also important for analysis\nservices processing we'll talk about\nthat a little in a little bit here later\nokay\nnow the four steps that we're going to\ntalk about are um\nidentifying the business process\nidentifying the grain choosing the\ndimensions and choosing the measures so\nthese are the kind of the four can steps\nthat you can use\nwhen you start approaching either\nbuilding a data warehouse from scratch\nor enhancing a data warehouse maybe you\nwant to bring in a new business process\ninto your existing data warehouse maybe\nin your data warehouse you've got retail\nstuff already and you want to bring in\nsome marketing um marketing facts so you\ncan use these four steps to kind of\num approach enhancing a data warehouse\nas well um and and as we're going\nthrough these steps um i want you to\nthink about and remember that the the\npurpose of a dimensional model a\nwell-designed dimensional model or star\nschema is we want it to be simple right\nwe want it to be easy to use\nwe want the etl to load these tables to\nbe as simple as possible\nwe want our queries to perform well and\nwe want this to\nperform also perform well with ssas um\nso let's start walking through these\nthese four steps here\nand and as mitch and i go through these\nsteps together\none thing we're going to we're going to\ndo is we're actually going to design a\ndata warehouse together so we've got\nthis kind of imaginary business um\na very successful business model you've\nprobably heard of this company buster\nblock they said they sell uh rentals to\nvhs movies um very successful in the\npast and so that's kind of our imaginary\nscenario we're going with here we're\ngoing to design a simple star schema for\nthis business okay and so we're going to\nwalk through these four steps together\num keeping in mind that we're designing\na star schema for a buster block\nall right so remember that and so we're\ngoing to kind of approach it from that\nstandpoint so that way\nwe can talk about these four steps but\nyou can also kind of see it in practice\nand you kind of have a good example of\nyou know using this\nin your particular environment\nnow\nthe the reason we're going with a retail\nexample here is that\nwe don't want to be complicated\neverybody understands how kind of how\nretail works somebody's buying a product\nright\nand so we don't want to get lost in the\nminutia of you know how the business\nactually works or um you know the the\ntechnology or from that kind of\nstandpoint so we want to go with\nsomething simple so it's easy to\nunderstand and we can focus on actually\nlearning the concepts here\nso we're going to start with\nidentifying the business process\nall right thank you dustin\nso identifying the business process is\ngoing to be the first step in designing\nour data warehouse and the question we\nwant to ask there is what is a business\nprocess\na business process is a natural business\nactivity performed in your organization\nthat is supported by some form of data\ncollection\nit's important to focus on the business\nprocess as opposed to the business\ndepartments\nbecause\nthis will allow us to deliver\ninformation across the business in a\nmore consistent manner\notherwise we may duplicate data if you\nthink about having a data warehouse in\nmultiple locations in your business for\nexample having a retail data warehouse\nand marketing and then a retail data\nwarehouse in sales we may have\nduplication of data that's not necessary\nand we want to have one centralized\nlocation for that information so what\nyou're really talking about here is\nhaving that one source of the truth\nright we want to focus on business\nprocess\nnot business department what we don't\nwant to happen\nis to have marketing have their own data\nwarehouse manufacturing have their own\ndata warehouse and then everybody\nshowing up to the same meeting saying\nwell this is what our profit should be\nfor this past quarter and everybody's\ngot different numbers so we're talking\nabout focusing on the business process\nthat may span across business\ndepartments\nexactly\ngood job dustin all right so we must\nfirst decide what business process we\nwant to model there's two steps that we\nwant to identify when we're modeling our\nbusiness process we want to look at the\nimpact that this business process is\ngoing to have in our data warehouse and\nwe also want to look at the risk that's\nassociated with this business process\nso the impact is going to be reports\nthat your business want on a daily basis\nvery common everyday\nimpact high availability reports the\nrisk associated with this business\nprocess are going to be things like data\navailability can we have access to the\ndata or is it going to be difficult to\nget do we have data quality problems you\nmight want something in your data\nwarehouse but when you look at the data\nit's very unclean and it's going to take\na lot of work to get that cleaned for\nyour data warehouse the third thing\nthere is you might have very complex\nbusiness logic that has to be applied to\nactually get that data warehouse up and\nrunning and it might be difficult to get\nthat information from all the different\ndepartments so we need to assess the\nimpact and the risk and both of those\nhave to take place as part of choosing\nthe proper\nchoosing the proper business process\nall right and the other thing we want to\ndo is we want to make sure we choose the\nbusiness process that has the most\nimpact from the beginning we want to get\nthat low hanging fruit so when we start\nour data warehouse project chances are\nwe're going to have multiple business\nprocesses that we identify we're going\nto have more than one\nwe're not going to have you know just\none process we're going to see three or\nfour or five different processes that\nwe're interested in\nall right\nso\nchances are we're not going to be able\nto fit all of those business processes\ninto our data warehouse we're going to\nhave to choose one or two or three or a\ncouple of those but we won't be able to\nfit all of them in there so this is\nwhere i mean what's that what's the best\nway to\ndecide\nwhat is the business process we start\nwith if we're if we've got people out\nthere that are starting a data warehouse\nfrom scratch how do they pick\nwhat business process do we start with\nit's a great question so a lot of times\nwhat you're going to find out especially\nwhen you're at a client so chances are\nthe business is already going to be\ntelling you what those high impact items\nare if you're working in a bi\nenvironment now then you probably have a\nuser or a group of users that come to\nyou on a regular basis and they say hey\ncan you send me that report again that\nshows me my profit margins by category\nor hey can you give me that report that\nshows me my freight that was delivered\ntoday\nand what they're really asking me for\nwhat they're really telling me is that\nthese are high impact business processes\nthat i need a lot of visibility into so\nchances are if you don't have a data\nwarehouse in your environment now then\nyou're probably going to have users that\nare already telling you that they need\nlots of visibility into these specific\nprocesses and their high impact for the\nbusiness so a lot of times the business\nis already going to have reports they\nwant that they're asking you for and\nit's going to be kind of obvious what\nyou want there now you're going to have\nto do a little bit of additional\nresearch to figure out is this a high\nrisk item or is this low risk is the\ndata going to be readily available is it\ngoing to be dirty data um is are we\ngoing to be able to get the business\ncalculations and the business logic that\nwe need so that's going to have to take\nplace as part of that process\nand so that's good\nanother thing that we want to consider\ndustin that we previously touched on is\nthat when we say identify the business\nprocess we're talking about business\nprocesses for the company not for an\nindividual department in the company and\nwhat we mean by that is you might have a\nretail data warehouse in your marketing\ndepartment\nand the marketing department is going to\ncome to that meeting that dustin was\ntalking about with their own set of\nnumbers and then you have another retail\ndata warehouse in your sales department\nand they come to that same meeting and\nthey say well we've had this much in\nsales and marketing says no we've had\nthis much in sales and we have\nconflicting numbers in our company so we\nwant to have one centralized data\nwarehouse one version of the truth for\nmarketing manufacturing sales and retail\nwe want to have all that in one data\nwarehouse so that's something that we\nwant to consider there\nanother way we might determine our\nbusiness process\nis\nby listening to the questions that our\nbusiness users are asking us so a lot of\ntimes we're going to hear a question\nthey're going to say what are the gross\nprofit margins for our product\ncategories for the previous month\nwhat are what's our average account\nbalance\nwhat is the average rental quantity\nwe're talking about uh buster block so\nwhat is our current rental quantity and\nthose are questions the business is\ngoing to ask us when they're asking us\nthose questions if we pay attention and\nwe listen closely then we're going to\nknow exactly what those business\nprocesses are that they're looking for\nthat are going to have high impact\nimmediately kind of that low hanging\nfruit in the company right so if you've\ngot if you have you know everybody's got\nthat one user that always comes from and\nsays hey can you give me that report hey\ni need that report again hey i need that\nreport you probably all have users like\nthat\nthe ones that they're coming and asking\nme for the most are probably the\nprocesses that have the most impact on\nthe business because they're the ones\nthat are going to know what's going to\nbe high impact so\nwhat i hear you saying mitch is we want\nto look for that low hanging fruit we\nwant to look for\nthose business processes that are going\nto have high impact for the business\neither make a lot of money for the\nbusiness save the business a lot of\nmoney make the business more efficient\nwhatever but it's going to be low risk\nwe can get the data we have people who\ncan help us figure out the logic um\nthat those kinds of things absolutely\nexactly\nokay so in this case\nwe've already identified our business\nprocess our example in this case is\nbuster block right our our video rental\nstore\nand so we're going kind of with a retail\nbusiness process here for this example\nokay now the next step here is we want\nto be able to um identify the grain of\nthe fat table okay\nnow\nthis is the most important decision that\nyou will make in your design process\nit's we need to identify what is going\nto be the grain in our factory table now\nif you're if you're new to data\nwarehousing you may not know what a fact\ntable is\na fact table is a table that's going to\nbe at the center of our star schema\nand it's the table that contains all of\nthe facts about the business how\nsuccessful the business is how many\nsales do we have how much quantity do we\nmove\nthose types of things so facts are\nmeasurements regarding the success or\nfailure of the business depending on\nwhat type of business process that we\ncould be modeling\nnow when we when we identify the grain\nwe want to determine what does one row\nin the fact table represent okay so if\nwe're working in some type of retail um\nscenario here where\num\nwe want to identify uh you know what\ndoes one row and our sales fact table\nrepresent um in the case of buster block\nit might be um a line item in a\ntransaction so for this business process\nwe're going to decide you know what one\nrow in this fact table represents a line\nitem in a single transaction so that\ncould be an example in a retail scenario\nand that's what we're going to go with\nfor this example\nnow\nfor um if you're working in some type of\num you know business process where you\nwant to track inventory\nmaybe you're deciding that you know what\none row in this fact table represents a\nrecord of inventory\num on a particular day so every day we\ngo out to our data warehouse we figure\nout or not our data warehouse our\nphysical warehouse and we determine okay\nwe've got you know what we've got 500\ncheese balls sitting on the shelf we've\ngot you know a thousand a thousand uh\nboxes of cereal or we've got you know\nwhatever is in our warehouse and we want\nto log that every day into our fact\ntable so maybe in an inventory example\none row would represent a\na um you know a record of inventory on a\ngiven day\num but when when you determine what one\nrow represents in your fact table it's\nimportant to\ndetermine to go with the most granular\nlevel you want to design your\ndimensional model to support\nthe most atomic or granular level that\nyou have with your data\num now when we're talking about atomic\nthe most atomic level we're talking\nabout data that cannot be\nsubdivided anymore we can't break it\ndown anymore this is as low as the data\ngoes we can't subdivide this anymore and\nthe reason we do this is because\ndata that is at the most atomic level\ncan be rolled up it can be aggregated it\ncan be sliced it can be diced and pretty\nmuch any way that the users want\nokay\num and this is really good for app talk\nqueries because the bottom line here is\nthat we can't predict\nhow the users are going to query the\ndata warehouse they might tell us that\nlook we want a report that does xyz or\nshows xyz right\nbut the moment they realize that okay\nwell we can ask other questions of the\ndata warehouse or we can ask other\nquestions of the cube\nthey're going to start\nfiring all kinds of other queries\nthey're going to connect to the cube\nwith excel they're going to slice and\ndice in ways that\nyou didn't really expect and so that's\none of the reasons that we want to store\nthis level data at the at a at the most\natomic level\num\nif we if we decide you know what\nyou know i've worked in situations where\nclients said we really only want the\ndata at the month level we don't care\nabout it at the day level um\nyou usually still always want to go with\num\na granular level because eventually\nthey're going to ask you hey can we look\nat this what happened you know we see\nit's something we see an anomaly at the\nmonth level right it's okay we want to\nfigure out where this happened at well\nwe can't right because we've aggregated\nour data warehouse up to the month level\nso we can't we can't roll it down\nand so that's that's always something to\nbe aware of\nso i got a question for you how much\nwork would it take to rework that i mean\nif you build your entire data warehouse\non a monthly level or maybe a weekly\nlevel or a daily level and you want to\ngo more granular how much work would\nthat take i mean if you designed your\nwhole data warehouse to be at the day\nlevel or i mean at the month level and\nyou and then later on down the road you\nknow what we want we want to take this\nfact table and we want to roll it um we\nreally want to change it to the day\nlevel if you don't have that history\nsomewhere else you're not going to be\nable to get it okay so that's that's a\nproblem for one\nbut if you can\nit's gonna be a lot of work because then\nyou're gonna have to rework the fact\ntable you're gonna have to rework\ndimensions um you're gonna have to\nrework etl you're gonna have to do a lot\nof rework there so um that's kind of why\ni said at the start of this that you\nwant to focus on getting this step right\nbecause if you mess this step up it's\ngoing to cause problems for you on later\non down the road\nokay so the bottom line here is we can't\npredict what queries the users are going\nto run against our data warehouse so we\nwant to store it at the most granular\nlevel so that way they can ask any\nquestions they want\nall right so in this particular case let\nme uh bring my\nvirtual machine over here so we can kind\nof do this together here all right so\nwe're going to stuff out here\na data warehouse designed together\nand so what was our what was our brain\nstatement\none row represents a line item in a\ntransaction at a\nbuster block store okay and so we're\ngoing to start here with the\nwith a new table\nand we're going to call this fact sales\nbecause we're going to give it the fact\nmoniker because this is a table that is\ngoing to contain our fat data those\nmeasurements that the business has\nidentified that they can use to\ntell how much success they're having in\nthe execution of their business\nokay oops already created that one so\nwe'll call it um\nin fact video sales how about that\nokay\nall right and so\nwhen we when we determine the grain of\nour fact table\num based on that grain\nwe can determine what kinds of\ndimensions which we're going to move\ninto here in a minute we can determine\nwhich kinds of dimensions um\nthat are going to be\nrelated to this fact so\nif we know it's a line item on a\ntransaction in a store so we know that\nthat there's going to be a product\nrelated to this right somebody's renting\na movie\nmaybe they're renting you know\ngone with the wind dances with the wolf\nsaving private ryan in mitch's case all\nabout miniature trains\nso we know that we're going to have a\nproduct dimension that's going to be\nrelated to this\nwe also know that a transaction is going\nto occur on a given day right so we know\nthat there's going to be a date\nassociated with this\nand a customer is going to be associated\nwith a transaction so that we know we're\ngoing to have a customer\num sk there for that\nand we're going to discuss what an sk is\nhere in a second\nand then also we've got product we've\ngot date we've got customer and what was\nthe other one we said we're gonna do and\nwe've got store right this is gonna be\nhappening in a store\nokay\nand so\nthis this fact table here kind of\nembodies what our grain is right this is\na transaction that's occurring with a\nproduct on a day with a customer\nat a store and so based on this we can\ndo analysis on how many products are we\ngoing to sell in us how do we how many\nproducts we sell in a store last month\nhow many products do we sell on this day\nhow many products are bought by our top\nten percent of customers how many\nproducts are our sale are our stores\nselling by store so we can do all kinds\nof different analysis based on uh this\nparticular grain\nso\nnow that we've kind of identified what\nis going to be the grain of our\nof our business process that we're\nmodeling here\nnow it's time to move into identifying\nthe dimensions what are the dimensions\nthat are going to be related to this\nparticular brain\nall right thank you dustin\nso what is a dimension a dimension is\ngoing to contain descriptive information\nregarding our data if i told you that we\nhad five million dollars in sales you're\nprobably going to have some questions\nabout that you might be excited that we\nhave five million dollars in sales but\nit's not very descriptive it doesn't\ntell you anything about our data so what\nwe want to do with our dimensions we\nwant our dimensions to answer those\nquestions that we might have questions\nlike what is the breakdown by product\ncategory which one of our stores had the\nhighest amount of cells\nhow much did we sell last month\nand we can break that information down\nby using those dimensions\nnow these are questions that we answer\nwith dimensions and if you've correctly\nidentified the grain this step is\nactually going to be very easy as dustin\njust showed you the related dimensions\nwill be easily identified\nfor instance our grain statement once\nagain is going to be one row represents\na line item on a transaction uh in that\nfact table\nall right so we have product\ndustin's already showed you that one\nwe're going to have customer we're going\nto have date and we're going to have\nstore cut dustin's going to go ahead and\nthrow those dimensions up there on our\nour diagram for you and then we'll start\ntalking about those attributes that are\nrelated to that but we can get that from\nthe grain statement one row represents a\nline item on a transaction we know the\ntransaction had a product that was\nrented we know there was a customer\ninvolved we know that it happened on a\nspecific date and at a specific store so\nthe grain is very important and\neverything else that we're going to do\nin and i do and working actually working\nthrough this data warehouse\nhowever if you're going through this and\nyou identify a dimension if you're\nlooking at your brain statement and you\nidentify a dimension that is not\ncorrectly represented in our screen\nstatement\nthen step two in the process identifying\nthe grain must be revisited we have to\ngo back to step two so dustin this is\nactually a good little segue here to ask\nyou do you see any chance that our\ngranularity identified can actually be\nsubdivided further because it's pretty\nlow right now\nthat's a good question and it's\nsomething that you have to take into\nconsideration as you're going through\nthe design of your data warehouse so in\nthis particular case we've determined\nthat one row in our fact table\nrepresents a line item on a transaction\nright\nbut if we get into the if we get into\nidentifying the dimensions and our\nbusiness our business users come to us\nand say hey\nwe want to be able to tie a particular\ntransaction to\na special that's going on a coupon that\nthe customer used um what some kind of\npromotion whatever might be going on in\nbusiness\nso that way we can analyze a promotion\neffectiveness\nnow if we do that and say okay well a\ncustomer could there could be one\npromotion or more than one promotion\nassociated with\na single transaction so maybe there was\na deal going on rent one movie get one\nfree kind of thing but they also had a\ncoupon for vaga skittles or something\nlike that okay so there's you've got\nyou've got a customer using a coupon and\nthen you've also got store promotion\ngoing on and so each of those promotions\nhas an effect on that sale and so we may\ndetermine that you know what the grain\nof this fact table isn't really one line\nitem\nit's a coupon one coupon per line item\nso we could have multiple coupons\nassociated with the line item so if that\nkind of happens where you decide that\nyou know what the grain of our fact\ntable is not correct we've got to go\nback and revisit this and it's important\nthat at this stage you go back to step\ntwo because we've got to get the grain\nnailed down this is the most important\nstep because like i said earlier if you\nmess up the grain\nand um and you\nand you find that out later\nit's going to cause a lot of rework so\nif you get to identifying the dimensions\nor if we get this step forward\nidentifying the measures and you\ndetermine that you know what our brain\nstatement is not completely correct we\nneed to go back and go back to step two\nand revisit that so that way we can get\nthat correctly because this is really\ngonna lay the foundation work for the\nrest of the data warehouse\num\nand and and the cube as well this is\ngonna play an impact on the cube so if\nyou if you find out you've done the\ngrain wrong and you're already into the\ncube part of it then you've really got a\nlot of work to do\nall right good job thank you dustin all\nright we actually have a couple\nquestions here a lot of people in the\nwebinar noticed that we did not add the\nemployee dimension\nand they're letting us know about that\nso if you want to throw that in there\nyou can and then also\nthe next thing that we have a lot of\nquestions on is what is a surrogate key\nso i'm coming to that point in just a\nsecond man it's like they're reading\nyour mind i know they're ahead of me\nhere we're going to talk faster okay so\nin my product dimension the first thing\nwe're going to do here in this\ndimensions we're going to add a database\nkey for the table the database key is an\nidentity key on the column and this is\ncalled a surrogate key this is going to\nhelp us with modeling the relationships\nbetween the dimensions and the fact\ntables now the reason we don't use the\nbusiness key is if we use the business\nkey then we're going to be vulnerable to\nthings like source changes in the\ntransactional system and that might not\nmean a whole lot to you right now\nand we don't have time to get deep into\ndetail on that but if something changes\nin your source system like a metadata\nchange the data type of that changes\nit's going to affect all the\nrelationships between your dimensions\nand your fact tables so we want to\ninsulate ourselves from those kind of\nchanges\nand that's what the surrogate key is\ngoing to give us\nso as we import data out of the\ntransactional system and into our data\nwarehouse if there are any changes in\nthe sources that could definitely cause\na lot of problems for us\nso\naside from just insulating ourselves\nfrom any of those issues in our source\nsystem with our data warehouse\nwe're also going to create a database\nkey um\ni'm sorry we're going to prove we're\ngoing to go ahead and create our product\nkey or our product id on our product\ndimension as well i'll let dustin kind\nof catch up here so the product id is\ngoing to be the business key we just\nmoved from our surrogate key which is\nthat primary key in our data warehouse\nbut that business key that's critical to\nour business is going to be the product\nid\nthe product id is going to be how we can\nessentially go from our data warehouse\nback to the transactional system and we\ncan kind of track and trace exactly\nwhere that product came from and we can\nsee exactly what that product is any of\nthe transactions around that product so\nthe business key relates back to the\ntransactional system but that surrogate\nkey does not that that unique identifier\nin our data warehouse does not relate\nback to the transactional system and\nthere's also a couple other reasons why\nwe want to have that surrogate key other\nthan just insulating ourselves from\nchanges in the source system one good\nexample is it's going to actually\noptimize the joins in our fact tables\nand our dimensions\nso now we're going to be joining our\nfact tables and our dimensions on single\ninteger columns on these simple integer\ncolumns instead of strings or any of\nthose other data types which is going to\nsimplify our model and improve our join\nconditions\nsurrogate keys are also going to allow\nus to keep historical information in our\ndimensions over time so if you're\nbuilding a very robust data warehouse\nand you want to be able to track\nsales when you were selling a product at\nfive dollars and when you were selling a\nproduct is six dollars and how much did\nwe sell did sales increase or did they\ndecrease we can keep that kind of\ninformation our data warehouse by\nkeeping a history of the price that we\nsold that item at or that we rented\nthose rentals at so that's what\nsurrogate keys give us we can't build a\nslowly changing dimension that changes\nover time using business keys\nthe other reason that we might want to\nuse uh\nor not use the business key is that we\nmight have\ntwo different departments in our\nbusiness that have different product ids\nfor the same product so you might have\nmarketing that simply calls all baseball\nbats just baseball bats but then our\nmanufacturing department might have a\nproduct id like abc123\nso those ids don't necessarily relate\nbetween those two departments but by\ncreating that surrogate key now we can\nhave\nthat one consistency in our data\nwarehouse so those are three other\nreasons why you might want to have\ncircuit keys\nor why we you should absolutely have\ncircuit keys in your data warehouse\nright so dustin is filling out your\ndimensional model right here on the\nboard here so in our product let's see\nwhat we have here we have product id\nthat's that business key we have product\nname product type to keep this a little\nbit simpler for a one hour webinar we're\nnot putting everything in there but just\nimagine what else you could have in your\nproduct dimension you might have product\nsize you might have the date that you\nstarted selling the product you might\nhave the list price of the product how\nmuch do we sell this product for\nthese are all things that we can track\nover time that's related to our product\nthat's a good one list for at this price\nthis price\nespecially for historical slowly\nchanging dimensions right i'm going to\ntrack over time\nall right so you have the sell date you\nhave the customer\nare we going to put the store in here\nall right all right so in the customer\ndimension we have our customer first\nname customer last name the address is\nvery important where are our rentals\ncoming from what zip code are we getting\nour rentals from and we can break that\ndown that can be information that we\ngive to our marketing department that's\nvery important we might do some other\nthings in customer as well though right\nwe might do gender\nwe might want to know if they're married\nor not\nwe might want to know their date of\nbirth so we can kind of get a an age of\nour average customer and the genres that\nthey might be coming in there and\nrenting from us so that would be very\ngood information to have\nall right all right and now you've\nthrown the store in there so in the\nstore we're going to have some good\ninformation in there as well we're going\nto have the store name we're going to\nhave the store\naddress we're probably going to have\nsome stuff like maybe the store manager\nnow as you get into a little bit more\nadvanced data warehousing concepts you\nmight break the store manager out into a\nseparate table but we want to keep this\nas close to a star scheme as we can so\nyou can you can add the store manager in\nthere absolutely\nand dustin's also going to add the\nemployee dimension\nnow i was actually interested in the\ndate dimension that you added over here\ndustin you got some\nwe could add a holiday in there friday\ninformation will be pretty interesting\nyeah exactly um now one thing that i'll\nmention here with um\nattribute selection\nis that the best kinds of attributes\nthat you're going to have in your data\nwarehouse are going to be those\nattributes that are most descriptive\nright\nso what you don't want to happen is you\ndon't want to have a\na a dimension like a store right that\nonly that is just full of ids right so\nyou've got like the store id maybe\nyou've got the um the you know geography\nid or you've got like all these\ndifferent types of ids um that are just\nall these integer values so the best\nkinds of attributes are going to be\nvery descriptive um types of attributes\nthat the users can look at and they\ndon't have to ask a lot of questions\nabout that what you don't want is you\ndon't want your user to\nhave to have sticky notes all over his\nmonitor\nbecause he's trying to figure out okay\nuh store id number 12 is the one that\ni've been watching lately so i need to\nhave that written down somewhere\nso you want them to be able to look at\nthe attributes and to have a very clear\nunderstanding of\nyou know what the data is\nwhat it what is what's included in there\nand they don't have to come to you with\na lot of questions about asking you know\nwhat does this mean right you want it to\nbe kind of\nintuitive from that kind of standpoint\nnow\ni want to point out now that we've kind\nof we've identified our dimensions here\nbased on our grain statement right and\nso we've determined that on at a\ntransaction item level we can we can\nwe can\nbasically understand there's a product\nassociated with that there's a date\nassociated with the sale an employee\nyou know\num\nworked with the sale worked with a\ncustomer on that sale that it happened\nin a store and a customer bought that\nproduct right so we've we've been able\nto identify our dimensions there\num and i want to point out a few things\nto be aware of um when regarding ssas\nokay um\nyou'll notice here that i included a\ndate dimension this is very important\nfor analysis services and so you want to\nmake sure that you always include a date\ndimension in your data warehouse and you\nand and some of you out there may be\nthinking okay well that's silly yeah duh\nwe want a date to mention our day where\nelse\nbut i have i have seen data warehouse\nand i have seen cubes before that didn't\nhave a date dimension and so it was\nalways it was always\njust kind of known by the users that\nokay this is just a point in time right\nthere's the date is going to be whatever\nis the last current date available\nwhich is not exactly all that useful\nbecause if you don't have a date\ndimension you can't track things that um\nyou know that aren't uh aren't included\nwith you know basic t-sql functions like\ncompany holidays\nor um fiscal calendars those types of\nthings so we need a date dimension to\ntrack those kinds of attributes\nbut\nalso in analysis services if you want to\ndo any types of time calculations like\nlast year last year\nhow many cheese balls we sell last year\nor or how many movies did we rent last\nyear or if we want to do any type of\nyear over year growth analysis or if we\nwant to build any trend reports or\nanything like that we're going to need a\ndate dimension and analysis services to\ndo that\nnow\nas i've kind of gone through the\ndimensional model here our star schema\nhere\nand i've i've put in the attributes into\nthe tables i've just kind of used\ngeneric data types and so this is just\nfrom a purely you know exercise\nstandpoint and so the data types here\naren't that important but in your\nenvironment they are very important you\nwant to make sure that you use the\nsmallest data types possible because\nthis is this is going to play ripple\neffects into analysis services so if if\nyou don't set your data types up\ncorrectly and you just set everything in\nyour data warehouse to a string we're\nsaying you know what everything is\nvarchar 50 and that's what we're going\nto go with\nthis is going to this is going to\nnegatively affect the performance of\nssas and the reason for this is because\nin analysis services your string data is\nactually stored in a separate file and\nso anytime analysis services has to\naccess\na string data whether it's a customer\nname a store name an address\na month name anything like that it has\nto go to this other file look up that\ndata and then return it to the results\nso there's going to be a performance\nimpact to\nto your queries and processing\nprocessing of your cubes when you use\nstring data so it's important to use the\nsmallest data type possible if you can\nstore something in an integer or a big\nend you want to do that because that's\ngonna that's going to um\nimprove the performance of your queue\nalso um it's important to just just kind\nof remember that a single field\nnon-nullable integer key is the is the\nbest data type we can use so if you can\ndo that do it\nbut like i said the best data is going\nto be the descriptive data so um you\ndon't want to go overboard you want to\nstrike a balance there if you can store\na customer\na customer name and use the i customer\nid that's an integer as the key value\nfor that column that's something good to\ndo there as well\nalso one thing that you want to keep in\nmind as you're going through the design\nof your star screen here is use user\nfriendly naming conventions don't go\nwith um you know don't expose things\nlike fact video sales to the users you\nwant to expose it as maybe just video\nsales in your cube um you know den\nemployee they're not going to understand\nthat dim is short for dimension so you\nwant to expose the the objects here in a\nuser friendly way\nand the last thing i'll say about this\nis about dimension optimization is look\nfor opportunities to build in natural\nhierarchies\ninto into your\ninto your dimension design\nand so we're talking about hierarchies\nwe're talking about you know arranging\nthe relationships between the data in a\nin a natural way such as you have\ncalendar year at the top you have\nmonth under that then you have um date\nright so you have this kind of natural\nhierarchy these natural relationships\nthat exist between the data\nbecause you can build those kinds of\nrelationships into analysis services and\nthose relation and when you have those\nthose attribute hierarchies or or\nuser-defined hierarchies correctly built\ninto analysis services it gives you a\nperformance bonus so that's something\nyou want to consider as well\nall right so i think i don't think i'm\ngoing to go any farther with this i\nthink you guys get kind of the point\nhere\nof what we're doing with the dimensional\nmodel here and so once we've um\nidentified the business process as step\none\nthen we've identified the grain and then\nbased on the grain we're able to\ncorrectly determine\nthe uh dimensions and the attributes\nthat are going to make those dimensions\nit's time to move on to the last step\nand that's\nidentify the measures that we want to\ninclude in our fact table\nokay so the measures\nare going to be\nhow does the business measure success\nokay so this is going to be\num you know say things like sales amount\num you know what was the what was the\nsale what was that line item sale amount\nwhat is the product cost associated with\nthat sale how many videos were on that\nline item did they rent you know a dvd\ncopy of uh you know dances with wolves\nand then a vhs copy they said well you\nknow whatever the case may be or did\nthey get you know ten bags of skills for\ntheir fat little kids\num you know so\nyou're going to have a a quantity\nassociated with that too that we\nprobably want to track\nnow i'll say the same thing here that i\nsaid when we were discussing designing\nor when mitch was discussing designing\nthe dimensions\nif we identify a measure that violates\nour grain what do we have to do guys we\ngotta go back to step two right we gotta\ngo back to step two because we've come\nup we've identified something in our\nmodel um that that violates our grain so\nwe gotta go back to step two\nlet's um revisit the grain statement\nmake sure that we actually have that\ncorrect and then we can come back and go\nback to step three make sure our\ndimensions are squared away that's all\ncorrect and then we can come back to\nstep four where we're gonna identify our\nmeasures identify the facts\num so in this particular case\nlet me pull back up my uh dimensional\nmodel here now we're ready to get\nstarted with the step where we're going\nto build in the measures into our cube\nso um we consult with the business say\nhey you know what are the measures you\nguys want to track what are those high\nimpact low risk metrics that we want to\ntrack here in our in our um\nin our cube or in our data warehouse so\nthey may say okay well we want a\nsales dollar amount right that's\nimportant and i'm just going to put\nthese as in but you know you probably do\nlike decimal or something\nthere's going to be a quantity\nassociated with that right\nand maybe there's also going to be a a a\ncost a cost amount right\nand that would be important to track if\nwe wanted to you know figure out any\ntype of um\nyou know profit or do any profit margin\ntype calculations\nokay\nnow and i'll just go ahead and put those\nthree and we'll just stick with that\nbecause those are three pretty common um\nmeasures that you probably have if you\nhave a retail um business process\nmodeled in your data warehouse you\nprobably have those types of measures as\nwell\nbut you might have other things like a\nshipping amount or tax amount or you\nknow whatever whatever the case may be\nnow when you're identifying measures for\nyour your star schema\nthe best measures that you can put in\nyour star schema are going to be\nmeasures that are fully aggregateable\nare are fully additive and what i mean\nby that is measures that can be rolled\nup they can be sliced and diced\nin any way shape or form and the number\nalways makes sense so\nfor example\nif we roll up our sales for all\ngeographies i can see what are my sales\nacross all of my geography regions right\nthat number makes sense if i want to see\nmy sales for\ncustomers that number still makes sense\nif i want to see my sales by month i can\nslice it by month that number always\nmakes sense okay because it's a fully\nadditive fully aggregateable measure\nthose are going to be the best kinds of\nmeasures to include in your queue\nbecause your user really can't slice\nthat wrong\nthey can't there's a they have to work\npretty hard to mess that up right\nso measures that are fully added fully\naggregateable are go and that are always\nvalid no matter how they slice and dice\nit those are going to be the best\nmeasures to include in your data\nwarehouse in your cube\nnow you may have a requirement for some\nmeasures that are not additive at all\nyou can't add them up and have them make\nsense so an example of something like\nthat would be not a\nprofit margin right so we can't put\nprofit margin in the table\nand then have the user add that up\nbecause that number would be nonsensical\nright it's not going to make sense to\nthe business or the users if they add up\nprofit margins for all geographies and\nthey'll end up with some crazy number\nthat won't make any sense right\nso\nmeasures that are non-additive\nthose are measures that are going to be\nbetter handled\nin the um in the data access tool so it\nmay not be ssas you know you may not be\nin ssa shop\nright you may be using some type of\nother reporting technology like tableau\nor something more\nmaybe you're you're even doing it in\npower bi or you've got something else\npower pivot or something else going on\nthere right those types of calculations\nlike profit margin are going to be\nbetter handled in the data access tool\nand certainly ssas can handle those\ntypes of calculations\nalso if you want to do any type of time\ncalculations like\nsales amount for last year\nsales amount or your year-to-date\nquantity or my year-to-date um\nor my last year year-to-date um so that\nway we can see are our sales growing\nthis year compared to last year are they\nactually increasing\nunit price those types of measures are\ngoing to be measured that you want to\nhandle in the report in the data access\ntool or ssas\nalso if you have any kind of type of you\nknow kpi metrics that you used you know\nkind of the red light green light yellow\nlight type of indicators that's\nsomething that's better handled than\nssas\nand so\nwhen you're\nwhen you're planning your data warehouse\nand if ssas is in the picture you want\nto keep in mind that a lot of a lot of\nmeasures can be better handled with ssas\nthose measures that are non-additive\nlike relative ratios\nor kpis or time calculations that those\nare better to be handled with ssas than\nin your data\nhouse\nif ssas is not in the picture then um\nyou know you're going to have to jump\nthrough a lot of hoops to build in some\nof these dynamic type time calculations\nthat ssas\ncan spit out in no time\nalso at this point it's also good to\nbegin estimating how many numbers what\nwhat's the number of rows that are going\nto be in this fact table right and so it\nmay be a small fact table you may have\nyou know you may determine that you know\nwe're only going to have 300 000 rows in\nthe stack table so that's not very big\nright it's not that's not a lot of data\num and so maybe uh you know a a clever\npartitioning scheme isn't appropriate in\nthat scenario but if you're a big\ncompany like amazon i can i can't even\nimagine how many transactions a day\namazon has a walmart something like that\nyou're going to have a ton of data in\nhere and so you want to start thinking\nabout okay what's my partitioning scheme\ngoing to look like right can we\npartition this table down at it\nyou know if you're big like walmart\nyou may even partition down at the\nhourly level so that um you know you may\nhave 50 million transactions at an hour\num if you're something if you're a\ncompany like walmart\num and if you're going to be\npartitioning your table your your table\nin your data warehouse you can align\nthose partitions with partitions in the\nmeasure group in your queue and that\nwill give you a performance bonus so\naligning your ssas partitions with your\ntable your sql server table partitions\nwill also give you an a\nperformance improvement there\nokay\nand so at that point\nwe\nidentified the dimensions\nthe uh the measures um and so we've got\na very basic um star scheme in here that\nwe're ready to start i'm kind of playing\nwith and massaging and developing and\nmoving on from here so\num mitch did you want to say something\nno but we do have a lot of questions\nokay\nwe'll get to the questions here in a few\nminutes here so um what i want to kind\nof do now is i just want to kind of\nrecap really quickly\nand i want to make sure that we have\nplenty of time for the question so we've\ngot about 10 minutes left in the session\nhere\nall right\nso let's recap real quick so the four\nbasic steps to designing your your star\nschema are\nidentify the business process we want to\nwe want to\nwhen we say business process we're\nspecifically talking about business\nprocess\nnot business department we want to\nidentify the grain what does one row in\nthe fact table represent\nwe want to identify the dimensions and\nif we get to this step and we decide oh\nwe we need a dimension that isn't\nrepresented by our grain statement we\nneed to go back to step two here and\ntalk about the grain\nand then and then if we we make a change\nto the grain then we'll come back to\nstep three choose the dimensions and the\nattributes and and continue development\nfrom there\nand then we want to um\ngo to step four which is choose the\nmeasures that we want to represent in\nour fact table\nnow i i have i've been consulting for\neight years here at pragmatic works so\ni've done a lot of data warehouse design\ni've done a lot of cube design done a\nlot of etl development\nand one of the things we do at pragmatic\nworks is we do what's called kind of a\nquick start if you're not familiar with\nthat is we go and we design a poc we go\nfrom zero to cube in about a week so we\ndesign the data warehouse we do etl we\ndo cube and we do reports in a week and\nso it's pretty crazy week\nbut i will say that this part here\ndesigning the data warehouse we usually\nspend about three days on it can be two\nto three days depending on the kind of\nquestions we have and\nand so this and the reason we spend that\nmuch time even though we still have etl\ncubes and reports to do is because this\nis by far the most important step\ngetting the data warehouse right if you\ndon't get the data warehouse right\nyou're going to have lots of problems\ndown the road so this is the most\nimportant step and that's why we spend\ntwo to three days uh discussing that\nnow\num resources if you're new to data\nwarehouse design um these two resources\nhere are killer these are the best\nresources in my opinion that you can\nfind the data warehouse toolkit you'll\nfind a lot of the material for this\nsession came from the data warehouse\ntoolkit because it's an excellent book\num written by ralph campbell margie ross\nchances are many of you out there have\nread this this is a great book and it\ntalks about these four steps and it goes\ninto a lot more detail than what we can\ndo here in a one-hour session so i\nhighly recommend this book the data\nwarehouse toolkit also the star schema\nstar schema the complete reference\nexcellent book as well these both of\nthese books in my opinion should be in\nevery professional bi um person's\nlibrary they're that great um and in my\nopinion the data warehouse toolkit is a\nlittle more instructional um and the\nstar schema is a better reference book\nbecause if you have special scenarios\nthat you're you want to research well\nhow do i handle a\nfact dimension or a degenerate dimension\nor a junk dimension those types of\nthings star scheme is going to be your\ngo-to resource for that so i highly\nrecommend\nboth of these as as resources for you so\nlook those up i i have both of these\nbooks in pdf and in paper format\num mitch does as well so i agree i like\nthe star scheme of the best if you're an\nintro to\nto data warehousing i just think it's\neasier to read i think it's an easier\nread it's not heavy on the technology\nthe data warehouse toolkit though\nyou will probably just read the first\nfive chapters and really get everything\nthat we talked about here and a lot more\nand then the rest of that book goes\ndepartment by department so it has\nretail human resources finance and how\nyou would model each of those different\nbusinesses so it's an awesome book an\nincredible book but i highly recommend\nboth of those books yeah they're great\nbooks and and one thing i'll say last\nthing i'll say about those books is that\num the really nice thing about those\nbooks is for the most part they're\ntechnology agnostic so you don't have to\nknow a lot about sql server you don't\nhave to know a lot about oracle um\nwhatever your database technology is um\nbecause they're they don't approach it\nfrom a technology standpoint they're\ntalking about it from a modeling\nconceptual standpoint so that's really\nnice\num so thank you everybody for attending\nour webinar i hope that you learned a\nlot i hope you um i hope that you got a\nlot out of the session and if you have\nquestions you can now's the time to\nstart asking your questions i know we've\ngot questions piling up now\num so and we've got about 500 people in\nthis webinar so it's going to be\nimpossible for us to answer every single\nquestion but we'll get to as many as\npossible\ni put up on the screen mine and mitch's\ncontact information you can email us at\nthose email addresses\nif you're a tweeter you can tweet us\nthere at sqldusty is my twitter handle\nat mitchell sql is mitch's and then\nthere's our websites there we blog about\nall kinds of different microsoft bi\nrelated things sql server scripts that\nwe think are useful\nssis design patterns analysis services\nstuff mdx power bi\num all kinds of stuff there so check out\nthose blogs you can ask us questions\nthere as well\nif you have a question and and you can't\nget through on the webinar there's the\ntwitter handle at pw question i'm sorry\npw question you can use that um for your\num\nand you can log on to twitter and you\ncan tag your question with that hashtag\nand we'll we'll go and take a look and\nwe're going to answer questions here in\nthe webinar for now but then when the\nwebinar is over um we're going to take\nthe remaining questions on twitter so\ncheck that out as well um so mitch\ndo we have questions we have more\nquestions than i've ever seen oh my\ngoodness i cannot keep up all right well\nwe'll handle these as best we can let's\ntry this one right here all right easy\nquestion how did you get to the database\ndesign window how did you get to the\ndata okay database design window so this\nis in sql server management studio so\nthat's a good question i'll just pull\nthat up real quick\nall right so there's my database design\nwindow\nwhatever and i went into my database\ni've just got a database here setup\nthat's called demo and i went to my\ndatabase diagrams folder and i just\nright clicked and set selected new\ndatabase diagram and so if you have\ntables that are already in your database\nthat you want to add you can select\nthose here and click add or you can just\nright click and start naming new tables\nand creating them from scratch so\npretty pretty simple all right so\nanother question we had was\nabout using the surrogate using an\ninteger value for the date\nwhy do we do that why would you\nrecommend that over using the date one\nperson i believe said that they think\nthat the kimbel book actually the one\nyou recommended actually recommends\nusing a date\nwell the reason that we go with the\ninteger and and um i can't remember\nspecifically why the kindle book said to\nto go with a date data type but and and\ni i i'm going to guess here and say that\nit's because it's a more user-friendly\nvalue um but this the circuit keys are\nimportant um in an integer type format\nis because they're going to perform the\nbest right and and they're the way that\nwe create relationships between the\ndimensions and the fact tables and\nremember the whole goal of the data\nwarehouse is high performance high\nperformance and so a single field\nnon-nullable integer key is going to\nperform the best okay and so that's the\nreason we go with a date a a an integer\nfield for our date key and our date\ndimension\num now\ni'll also mention here that the state\nkey is a little bit different than our\nother instead of being than our in our\nother keys in our other dimensions\nbecause instead of going with just an\nidentity column where we're just gonna\nyou know auto increment it one at a time\nwe're gonna go with our date dimension\nwith what's called a smart key and\nbasically the format looks like um\nit'll look like something like this\nright if you're looking at my screen\nthe format for\njanuary 1st 2012\nit's going to be an integer value but\nit's going to be formatted to look like\na year\na month and a day so it's still going to\nbe user friendly but then at the same\ntime we're going to get the performance\nbenefits of having a non-nullable single\nfield integer key in the data dimension\nso that's why we typically go with the\num the date plus if you're trying to\nfind a record in your in your day\ndimension or in your fact table um you\ndon't actually have to join to the date\ndimension to get it because your fact\ntable already has the date stored in the\ndata sk and so you can read that and so\nthat's kind of nice too\nbut that's a good question as well\nif you want to try to take one more this\none's a little tough but there's a lot\nof questions around this one it's\nsomething that dustin will have a blog\nout there with a lot of these questions\nanswered for you but they wanted to know\nwhen you would\nhave a dimension with a dimension when\nwould you break off for a snowflake and\nthere's a lot of questions around that\nyeah so and and\nthere's there's a that's kind of a big\nhot debate topic because some people\nwill say\num well you might want to snowflake\nright if you um if you if you want to\nmaybe you want it for instance something\nlike product and product category right\nmaybe you want to break product category\nout because we might have another fact\ntable that doesn't relate to product but\nit relates to product category maybe\nwe've got a forecast fact table right\nthat we don't forecast at the individual\nproduct level we forecast at a product\ncategory level and so we might have a\nforecast fact table and so\nthat may be a case where you'll see some\npeople say hey\nwe want to um snowflake that out\num\nnow that that's fine and you can\nconvince me that you may want to do that\nbut one thing that i'll mention in\nregards to analysis services that when\nyou begin snowflaking\nin your data warehouse\nthere's going to be an impact on the\ndesign of your cube so what analysis is\nyou have a\na um what's called a reference dimension\nright where you use an intermediate\ndimension to relate that product\ncategory to our fact sales table and so\nthat's gonna there's there's some impact\nthere with having a reference dimension\nwhich you can find on my blog on\nsqldusty.wordpress.com if you do a quick\nsearch\num let's see i've got it up here pull it\nup real quick\nso there's my blog sqldusty.com so if\nyou go to sql dusting you search\nresearch reference to me\nthere's a lot of reasons why you might\nconsider going with a star schema and\ntypically you see that with people who\nare um more um come from a transaction\nor an oltp development side because they\nwant they tend to want to kind of\nnormalize things a little bit because\nthat's what they've always done it's\nkind of leaning towards that more third\nnormal form kind of way\nof doing things um but you'll you'll get\nbetter performance\num and you and you'll get better\nperformance with your data warehouse\nloading your data warehouse and querying\nyour data warehouse um if you if you try\nnot if you try not to normalize things\nif you stick with a more denormalized\ndesign because remember the bottom line\nis we want good performance right we're\nwilling to sacrifice some storage or\nwill if we're willing to sacrifice some\nredundancy\num or or some duplication of data rather\num for better performance that's really\nthe the end goal here is query\nperformance query performance query\nperformance\num that's a good question as well\nall right i think that's all we have\ntime for today but we're going to be\ndoing some questions afterwards is that\ncorrect yep yep so if you have further\nquestions\nuh we'll take questions for about 15 20\nminutes or so on twitter depending on\nhow crazy it gets we'll try to get to\nall the questions on twitter there's the\nhashtag hashtag pw question if you have\nfurther questions that we just didn't\nhave time to get to here in the webinar\num log on the twitter hashtag pw\nquestion you can hashtag your question\nwith that and then we'll try to get to\nthose as many as possible but thank you\nso much everybody for coming to our\nwebinar we hope that you found it useful\num we enjoy doing these kinds of\nwebinars so um if you have further\nquestions about any of this kind of\nstuff log on to twitter check out our\nblogs go to pragmaticworks.com\nlots of great resources at\npragmatworks.com and that is where the\nrecording will be posted on\npragmaticworks.com\n[Music]\nyou\n",
