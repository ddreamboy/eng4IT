  "text": "[Music]\nhi my name is Doug Chase I'm the\ndirector of training for Coral cyber\nsecurity and I thank you for joining me\ntoday\nso I've been asked to talk about uh\ncyber security best practices uh which\nis a it's a very big topic it means a\nlot to different organizations for small\nbusinesses medium businesses and\nEnterprises all of which means something\ndifferent you also have best practices\nfor specific verticals such as\nHealthcare manufacturing Financial\norganizations educational institutions\nyou know so it's a very big topic it can\nactually get very confusing to unravel\nsome of that confusion an organization\ncalled the nist the National Institution\nfor standards and technology which is a\ngovernment organization under the\nDepartment of Commerce put together\nFrameworks that allow you to be able to\ndo press best practices across basically\nanything that's complex and important\nand cyber security is one of those\nFrameworks so the framework itself for\nnist is uh you know kind of hinges on\nFive Pillars which is identify you know\nthe ability to be able to identify what\nin your organ organization you want to\nprotect who you want to protect the\nability to protect it right so so what\ninformation do you want to protect and\nhow do you how do you envision yourself\nprotecting this really valuable\ninformation\nbeing able to detect but how do we know\nif something if a cyber security event\nis occurring then it hinges up upon your\nability to be able to respond to it so\nwhen an event occurs how are you as an\norganization going to respond and deal\nwith it and then finally being able to\nrecover from it right do you have a\nbusiness continuity or Disaster Recovery\nplacement plan in case of a worst case\nscenario so this framework identify\nprotect detect respond and recover form\nthe basis of many many uh different uh\ncategories within each of them so once\nyou've gone through that exercise in\nterms of the identifying protecting\ndetecting responding recovering then you\nlook at your own organization when you\ndig a little bit deeper nist uh you know\nactually has four tiers of where they\nconsider organizations to be in terms of\ntheir cyber security Readiness uh the\nfirst one is partial which is basically\nyou don't have much in place at all\nexcept maybe some of the technologies\nthat are already built in to uh the\nproducts that you're currently using so\nuh you know essentially you're just\nleaving it up to chance and you'll deal\nwith whatever comes when it comes then\nyou have risk informed which is where an\norganization has awareness of what the\nrisks that are out there they understand\nfishing and they understand malware and\nransomware and things like that but for\nwhatever you know their own reasons they\ndon't have the tools or the resources in\nplace to be able to implement any of\nthat but at least they're aware of it\nand then you have repeatable and\nrepeatable is where you have some of\nthese tools in place and you can be\nproactive to a degree in terms of being\nable to get out ahead of some of these\nthreats and then finally adaptive is the\nlast year and adaptive is the most\nintelligent which means that you've put\ntools in place that are able to adapt to\nchanging needs from a cyber security\nrisk perspective adaptive is where you\nwant to be because that's where your\nbest cyber Security Bank for your buck\nis going to be the ability to be able to\nadapt to new threats coming in and the\nability to be able to adapt not only to\nnew threats but also the ways that\nattacks are occurring such as you know\nwithin you know the data itself The\nInsider threats email Cloud application\nsecurity endpoint protection right these\nare things that constantly need to be\nmonitored constantly need to be updated\nand frankly most organizations\nparticularly small and medium-sized\nbusinesses don't have either the\nresources in-house or the budget you\nknow to go best to breed across the\nboard that's why Coral was invented\nspecifically was to be able to allow\nsmall and medium-sized businesses to\nhave an Enterprise like implement\nrotation tier at a budget frankly that\nis\nincredible you know for the value that\nit brings\n",
