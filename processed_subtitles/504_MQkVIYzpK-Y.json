of this video\nin this video we will cover topics like\nwhat transfer learning is how transfer\nLearning Works moving forward we will\ndive into why you should use transfer\nlearning after that we will cover the\nsteps to use transfer learning and at\nthe end we will see popular model\ntrained using transfer learning let me\ntell you guys that we have regular\nupdates on multiple Technologies

tensorflow\nand many more skills so why wait enroll\nnow and unlock exciting Ai and ml\nopportunities the course Link in is in\nthe description box below so without any\nfurther Ado let's get started so what is\ntransfer learning transfer learning is\nmachine learning refers to G using a\npretend model to improve prediction on a\nnew task it involves using knowledge\ngained from a previous assignment to\ntackle a related problem for instance a\nmodel trained to recognize backpacks can\nalso be used to identify other objects\nlike sunglasses due to the substantial\nCPU power required this approach is\nwidely utilized income Division and\nnatural language processing tasks\nincluding sentiment analysis so moving\nforward let's see how transfer Learning\nWorks so how does transfer learning work\nin computer vision neural network have\ndistinct objectives for each layer\ndetecting edges in the first layer and\nidentifying forms in the middle layer\nand capturing tasks specific features in\nthe later layer transfer learning\nutilize the early and Center layers for\na pre-pretent model and only retrains\nthe later layer it leverages the label\ndata from its original task for instance\nif you have a model trained to identify\nbackpacks in images and now want to use\nit to detect sunglasses we will retrain\nthe later layers to understand the\ndistinguished features of sunglasses\nfrom the other objects so moving forward\nlet's see why should you use transfer\nlearning transfer learning offers\nseveral advantages including reduced\ntraining time improved neural network\nperformance in most cases and the\nability to work with limited data\ntraining a neural model from scratch\ntypically requires a substantial amount\nof data which may not always be readily\navailable transfer learning becomes\nvaluable in such scenario here is why\nyou should consider using transfer\nlearning first one is efficient use of\ndata with pre-trained models you can\nperform well even with limited training\ndata that is specially beneficial in\ntasks like NLP where obtaining large\nlabel data set can be challenging and\ntime Computing the second one is faster\ntraining building a deep neural network\nfrom a scratch of a complex task can be\ntime consuming taking days or even weeks\nby leveraging transfer learning the\ntraining time is significantly reduced\nas you start with a model that has\nalready learned General features from a\nrelated problem now moving forward let's\nsee steps to use transfer learning the\nfirst one is training a model to reuse\nit in machine learning training a model\ninvolves providing it with the data to\nlearn patterns and make prediction once\na model is trained on a specific task it\ncan be reused and repurpose for related\ntasks saving time and computational\nresources the second one is using a\npre-trained Model A pre-trained model is\na model that has already been trained on\na larger set for a specific task instead\nof training a model from scratch using a\npre-trained model as a starting point\nallow us to benefit from the knowledge\nit has gained during its previous\ntraining the third one is extraction of\nfeatures feature extraction is a process\nin which meaningful patterns and\ncharacteristics are identified and\nseparated from a raw data in the context\nof machine learning it involves\nidentifying relevant information from\ninput data to feed into a model for a\nbetter prediction the fourth one is\nextraction of features in neural\nnetworks a neural networks feature\nextraction involves identifying\nimportant patterns or features in the\ndata at different network layers the\nearly layers typically capture simple\nfeatures like edges while deeper layers\ncapture more complex feature relevant to\nthe task at hand this hierarchical\nrepresentation enables neural network to\nlearn and generalize from the data\neffectively\nso moving forward let's see some popular\nmodels trained using transfer learning\nso numerous machine learning models have\nbeen trained using transfer learning\nsome popular ones include for the first\none is\nvgg16 and vgg 90.\nthese models were trained on the image\nnet data set for image classifications\ntest the second one is inception V3\nthese models were pre-trained on\nimagenet and are known for their\neffectiveness in which rapid in object\ndetect repeat in object detection and\nobject recognition the third one is bird\nbi-directional encoder representation\nfrom Transformer this language model is\nwritten on the extensive text collection\nand find extensive application in NLP\ntasks like sentimental analysis and name\nentity recognition the fourth one is GPT\ngenerative pre-trained Transformer\nseries these models are printed language\nmodels for various NLP tasks\nthese are just a few example of\npre-trained models that have been used\nin transfer learning to accelerate\ntraining and improve performance across\ndifferent tasks and with that we have\ncome to end of this video on what is\ntransfer learning I hope you found it\nuseful and entertaining please
