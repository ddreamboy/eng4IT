  "text": "in this video you're going to learn all the \nfundamentals of data analysis and we'll break  \nthis down into four main areas first we're \ngoing to be looking at transforming the data  \nso cleaning it up secondly we're going to be \nlooking at creating descriptive statistics to  \nunderstanding better third we're going to be \nlooking at data analysis and finally we'll get  \ninto creating a report to visualize our findings \nso let's get into it and thank you to Coursera  \nfor sponsoring this video more on them later the \nfirst step here is to transform the data and for  \nthis here's the Excel file that we'll be working \nwith which you can download for free in the video  \ndescription so as you can see this is going to \nbe for a fast food chain you can see the types  \nof products here and the first step is simply \nto clean this up but for that we're going to  \ngo to control T So to change this into a table \nso change the data set into a table then we'll  \nhead on OK from here for the cleanup part you can \nsee that under the manager column we seem to have  \nsome very odd spacing here so let's go ahead and \nclean that up here we're going to go to equals  \ntrim hit the top key and this formula is going \nto remove these old spaces I'm going to hit enter  \nthere you can see that's going to Auto populate \nfor all of these we'll change this name to manager\nand then for all of these that are \ncurrently linked to this column over  \nhere we're going to paste them as values \nso we're going to go Ctrl shift down  \nCtrl C and then we're gonna paste this as a value \nso alt h v v is a shortcut for that and now that  \nmeans that we can go ahead and remove this column \nby hitting Ctrl minus there you go then under  \nquantity you might notice that we've got these \ndecimals which don't make too much sense you can't  \nreally have half a burger and so for this we're \nbasically gonna have to round up to a whole number  \nfor that we're going to use the Roundup formula so \nequals round up hit the top key there the number  \nis this one comma and the number of digits for \nus is going to be zero because we want the full  \nnumber close those brackets and hit enter so this \nis going to be our quantity now hit enter there  \nand we basically wanna Ctrl shift down Ctrl C \nand then paste as values so alt h v v v again  \nthere you go so now we can remove this column \nhere so we're going to select it and control minus  \nthen you'll notice that under City here we have \nthe city names but we don't necessarily have  \nthe countries that would be a nice thing to add so \nfor this we can actually head over to the data tab  \nand go under data types you'll find \ngeography here so just click on that  \nonce you start to see that icon it means that \nit's loaded up what you want to do here is  \nhit over to this icon to the side under add \ncolumn and we basically want to add a country  \nor a region associated with that City and you \ncan see that we have the corresponding country  \nfor each City if you want to move this city \ncolumn next to the country you can actually  \ngo ahead and select it up top and we start to \nsee these arrows when you hover over it just  \npress the shift key and then just drag it across \nlike so that should allow you to move everything  \none final thing we haven't done here is test \nif there's any duplicates so for this we can  \nsimply go under data again and we're just going to \nremove duplicates by going to this icon over here  \nso we'll click on that and it's going to be \nfor that whole table and we'll simply hit on OK  \nand you can see here that we get a notification \nsaying that five duplicate values were found and  \nremoved so we'll hit on OK there and speaking \nof data analysis if this is something that  \nyou want to learn more about you can check out \nGoogle's data analytics professional certificate  \nit's designed to teach you job ready skills \nfor any data analytics role so you can learn  \nall the skills required in less than six months \nthe program currently has well over 1 million  \nstudents in a 4.8 star

data cleaning \nanalysis and visualization using some of the  \nmost common industry tools such as spreadsheets \nSQL or R programming upon completion you'll  \nreceive a Google professional certification which \nyou'll be able to share on your CV and Linkedin  \nso if you're interested sign up for a seven day \nfree trial Now using the link in the description  \nbelow alright back to the video great now \nthat we've done step one and step two it's  \nall about the descriptive statistics so really \nseeing things like what's the average price what  \nabout the minimum the maximum and so on so for \nthis let's hop over to the side and you could  \ntry to find for the price and for the quantity say \nthe average going one by one so type the average  \nformula then doing the same thing with the minimum \nthe maximum so on but there is a much faster way  \nthat's actually using a tool called Data analysis \nfor that we're gonna have to activate it it should  \nbe over here to the side under the data ribbon \nif you don't have it like me we can go ahead  \nand activate it so we'll head over to file \ngo over to the bottom where it says options  \nfrom here we're gonna go into add-ins and we want \nto click on the analysis toolpack here and hit on  \ngo from here we want to select analysis toolpack \nlike I said and we'll hit OK now you can see that  \nwe have this data analysis option under the data \nribbon so that's the one that we want to select\nfrom here we want the descriptive \nstatistics and we'll hit on OK there  \nand the input range is going to be all of \nour prices so we'll go Ctrl shift down there  \nand then we want it to be a summary statistics and \nwhere do we want this let's say we want an output  \nrange which is going to be up over here so right \nnext to the table let's say we put it here to the  \nside there we're just going to hit on OK and now \nyou can see that for the price which is what we've  \nselected we've gotten everything from the mean \nthe median mode minimum maximum sum and a bunch  \nof other useful information let me repeat that \nsame process for the quantity awesome now we've  \ngot the breakdown by price and by quantity as well \nbut one thing that this doesn't quite account for  \nis the fact that there could be outliers in our \nprice so for that we can go ahead down over here  \nwe're gonna basically create a new chart which \nis going to be a box and whisker so let's first  \nselect all of the prices so Ctrl shift down \nand down over here you're gonna find this icon  \nclick on that and we want a box and whisker \nbasically this one over here and don't worry  \nif you can't interpret it we'll look at it just \nin a second let me move that all the way up  \nso once we have it in here this is basically \ntelling us a few different things so first  \nthese top and bottom lines are telling us \nthe maximums so the Max and the Min if you  \nwill and then in here this box represents the \nfirst and the third quartile and then you can  \nsee that we've got that X which is the average \nthen we've got a line which is going to be the  \nmedian and finally we've got these dots over here \nwhich represent all of our outliers in our price  \nnow if we want to dig a bit further into this \nit would be nice to see the x-axis maybe we can  \nput something like the manager's name to see where \nexactly this is coming from maybe it's one manager  \nthat might be reporting the data wrong so we'll \ngo to right click for that go under select data  \nedit the horizontal category access label \nhere and what we're going to do is put the  \nmanagers so we're going to select all \nof these Ctrl shift down and hit on OK  \nand hit on OK again now if we go all the way back \nup you can see what that breakdown looks like  \nby manager and it seems to be that all of these \noutliers are accumulated with Joel maybe we should  \nhave a word with him now moving on to step 3 which \nis data analysis so over here you can see that  \nwe've got three different questions that we want \nto solve which is what is our best selling product  \nwhat is our total revenue and that's what's our \nRevenue breakdown by payment method so if we go  \nback to the table here you notice that we don't \nactually have a column for Revenue so that's one  \nthat we're going to have to calculate simply \nby multiplying the price and the quantity so  \nwe'll do that over here let me add an extra column \nthere and let's call this something like Revenue\nand the formula for it is going to be equals the \nquantity multiplied by the price and we'll just  \nhit enter there that should be calculated for us \nand then we'll go up over here again and for all  \nof this analysis we can actually do most of it \nwith a pivot table so we'll head over to insert  \npivot table the table or range we're interested in \nis all of this range so once we select one of the  \ncells we can just go to control a that's going to \nselect all of them and we want this in a location  \nin an existing worksheet which we already selected \nso we'll hit OK great from here we can start doing  \nall the breakdown so what's our best selling \nproduct so let's do this by quantity we're going  \nto select the products as the rows just hover that \nover and then we're gonna check the quantity over  \nhere as the values great now we have all of that \nbreakdown if we want to sort it from highest to  \nlowest we can go to right click and go to sort \nand we'll sort largest to smallest and now you  \ncan see that beverages is our largest at 35 000. \nthen secondly we've got what is our total revenue  \nfor this one we're simply going to have to select \nthe revenue so first we'll remove these let's take  \nthis out and we'll take this out as well and \nwe just have to select the revenue and put it  \nunder values that should give us the sum of total \nrevenue which seems to be 812 000. and finally our  \nRevenue breakdown by payment method so for that \nwe're gonna get all of the payment methods and  \nput those under the rosie like so but to see the \nbreakdown better it probably makes more sense as  \na percentage so what we can actually do is go to \nright click and from here go to summarize show  \nvalues ask sorry and we're going to show them as a \npercentage of the grand total now you can see that  \nfull breakdown and it seems like credit cards are \nthe most dominant here now that you've seen how to  \ndo some of the data analysis let me show you what \na final report might look like this one here is  \nfairly simplified so you can see that we've got \nthis drop down which is using data validation  \nto select the manager and everything dynamically \nchanges so if I select dwell I'm able to see which  \ncountry and city is from using the X lookup and \nthen just below that using the sum ifs I'm able  \nto derive his particular revenue for fries and \nthe other products as well as his total revenue  \nand these data bars over here are done using \nthe conditional formatting if you're unsure  \nhow to do this type of formulas you can check \nout this video over here or this link over here  \nto take our Excel codes hit the like and that \nsubscribe and I'll catch you in the next one\n",
