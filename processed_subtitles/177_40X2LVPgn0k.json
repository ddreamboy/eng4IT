  "text": "hi everyone I'm Jamie you and today's\ntalk is going to be about speech\nrecognition so I just want to introduce\nthe history of speech recognition\nexactly how it works and why this is\nrelevant to us today so just a simple\ndefinition of speech recognition as you\nsee on the image it's a three-step\nprocess speech speech recognition and\nthen speech transcription or simply\nknown as speech to text and then our\nstory starts in the 50s\nspecifically in 1952 in Bell Labs they a\npioneered speech recognition and a\nsoftware called Audrey and Audrey is\nshort for automatic digit recognizer and\nas you can see it's the same three steps\nas before where the human is outputting\nspeech the software machine is\nrecognizing speech to that microphone\nand through the actual software itself\nand it's transcribing that speech on\nthat monitor to the right where you see\nthat number two and Audrey is short for\nautomatic digit recognizer because it\nrecognizes ten digits and you can\nprobably guess the digits a one zero to\nnine and we go to the 60s where in 1962\nIBM made its own software that could\nrecognize speech called shoebox and it\nwas a minor improvement so instead of\nrecognizing only 10 words it could\nrecognize 16 so 10 digits on top of 6\ncommand words such as plus minus\nmultiply so we could also do\nmathematical functions so if you were to\nsay in 1962 and you had a shoebox in\nfront of you you could say 1 plus 1 and\nit would output 2 so how these\ntechnologies work back then was it has a\nspeech unit and then these speech units\nare split up into tiny phonetic units so\nfor example the word full-stack we could\nsplit that up into its tiny phonetic\nunits that the computer would parse and\ninput\nact together to be able to recognize\nthat word so for example whole stack\nwould be something like four step cook\nthat's the very I butchered it but\nsomething like that and then put it back\ntogether to understand it and then we\nhave the 70s and actually a lot of\nimprovements came in the 70s at the\nDepartment of Defense and the US\ngovernment really poured a lot of money\ninto speech recognition and they built\nupon the pre-existing systems to build a\nmore robust brute search force algorithm\nso it's basically the same system as we\nsaw before with the phonetic units\nexcept these phonetic units are mapped\nwith a node system and in during the 70s\nthe size of this node map was about 15\nthousand nodes was the largest that they\ncould get up get it up to you at that\ntime and that enabled speech recognition\nto go recognize 16 words to a thousand\nwords and it's basically just when you\nutter speech it just kind of maps it\nalong the node map until it recognizes\nit and then it spits that back out and\ntranscribes\nyour speech and more improvements came\nin the 70s with the hidden Markov model\nso this algorithm really gave a huge\nboost to speech recognition and it's\nbasically just complex mathematical\nsystem algorithm that uses probability\nand this hidden Markov model was the\nbasis of speech recognition for from the\n1970s to the 2000s and how it works is\nbasically you're given a word and it's a\nchain and then each if you notice this\nchain each node is yeah the phonetic\nunits that the the word is made up of\nand then the nodes are connected by a\nlink and this link is called a phenome\nand the numbers assigned to these\nphenome they're the probability that the\nalgorithm spits out based on its\nmathematical algorithm\nprobability and all that that they\ncompute as well as the built-in\ndictionary that hidden Markov model used\nand using these numbers based on what\nthey call see gnomes they use this to\nyeah improve speech recognition so what\nthis does in the end in practical terms\nis that it accounted for differences in\naccents as well as different Cadence's\nso in the example of potato this speech\na software system using this hidden\nMarkov model would be able to recognize\nboth potato and potato unfortunately\nthough even with this advancement you\nstill have to speak very unnaturally\nspeak using pauses between words and\nthis is called discrete speech so you\ncan't speak naturally like like humans\nwould and a continuous flow but you'd\nhave to pause between each word and then\nwe have the ATS and this is the first\ntime that we have speech to text on a\ncomputer and just a company called\ncursor all technologies made by Ray\nKurzweil on left just pioneered this the\nfirst commercial large vocabulary speech\nrecognition software in the 80s and then\nthe 90s there are more milestones then\nand this is a major breakthrough we're\nfinally speech recognition went from\nrecognizing discrete speech to continue\nin a speech and because continuous\nspeech is closer to human speech it\nfinally gave it a chance to become more\ncommercial and more mainstream so a\ncompany called dragon came out with the\nfirst like really mainstream available\nto normal people kind of saw a speech\nrecognition software but not too\nmainstream because in 1994 when it came\nout the program was about nine thousand\ndollars yeah so still kind of expensive\nbut landmark nonetheless but\nin the background through all this time\ninto eighties and nineties\nneural networks was another algorithm\nthat was being pioneered and being\nresearched to kind of replace the hidden\nMarkov model and just to create like a\nnew algorithm to compute speech and\nneural networks was pioneered by this\nman right here his name is Geoffrey\nHinton and he's a cognitive psychologist\nand computer scientist most noted for\nhis work on artificial neural networks\nand he is often called the godfather of\ndeep learning and just to give\ndemystified deep learning and machine\nlearning and neural networks and just to\ndemystify and break it down a bit the\ntype of programming that we do more\nfunctional programming where we give\ngiven parameters and rules there's an\nactual programmer with expert knowledge\nwho like kind of programs hard programs\nin like like rules so if you hit a\ncertain case and this will happen and it\ntells the program explicitly what to do\ndeep learning or neural that networks\nthat Geoffrey Hinton pioneered is a\ntotally different type of system where\nthe the program is dynamic it's based on\nlike models and based on the input it\ncan actually learn and it's completely\ndifferent than the type of programs that\nwe give it where it's more of like an\nif-then that we hard code ourselves so\nthe inspiration behind er all networks\nis our own human brain because Geoffrey\nHinton noticed yeah babies basically\nunderstand languages at even the first\nyear or like a two year old baby but the\ncomputers just don't have that\ncapability and you want to kind of mimic\nthe brain as much as possible on to\ncomputer so just to give a brief summary\nof human brain the human brain has 100\nbillion neurons or 10 to the 11th of\npower neurons seven thousand seven\nthousand synapses or seven thousand\nconnections between different neurons\nand at any given moment there's around\n20,000 70,000 different inputs of data\nbetween these different neurons\nso neural networking is basically just\nkind of using the same principle of\nneurons in our brain just using that as\na model for the computer and each node\nis just a kind of like a metaphor\nrepresentation of a neuron and the\nconnections between each node is synapse\nsort of connection between neurons and\nyeah Geoffrey Hinton is noted as the\ngodfather because kind of like given the\nthug status and the deep learning\ncommunity because he worked on this for\ndecades maybe around three decades I\nthink and many people told him that he\nwas wasting his time because often and\nwithin this entire time it was outpaced\nby the hidden Markov model but that's\nonly because there was a limitation in\nthe data the neural networking how it\nworks and machine learning deep learning\nall these things how it works is that it\nneeds a lot of data to be able to learn\nand to be able to grow and adapt well\nand to be able to perform well and just\nat that time while he was researching it\nthere just wasn't enough data around and\nthen so we hit the 2000s and this was\nnot the advent of the Internet but I\nwould say the first decade where the\ninternet really just started gaining\nmore speed Ella as well as the\nproliferation of the smartphone and the\nphone in general and Google had finally\nhad enough information from the net from\nthe internet just from different search\nqueries and like a humongous pool of\nhuman speech samples collected by them\nto be able to really use neural networks\non a better scale and they it was in\n2008 that Google Voice Search made its\nway to the iPhone and yeah this method\nof neural networking it effectively\ndealt with issues of data availability\nand a lack of processing ability that\ntroubled speech recognition software in\nthe past and then we come to 2000 2010s\nor the decade that we are currently\nliving in and I would say that this\nthe decade of the voice assistant and\nyou guys will probably recognize these\nnames probably really familiar to you\nright now going from left to right is\nApple Siri Microsoft's Cortana Amazon's\nAlexa and Google's Google now and these\nfour little caricatures on the\nPowerPoint are basically just\nrepresentations of voice assistants that\nthese different companies have made and\nparticularly recently Amazon's Alexa is\nvery popular if the image right here is\na echo dot which is just a physical\ninterface that you can use to interact\nwith the voice assistant Alexa and it's\na how it works is that you say Alexa and\nthen a command and Alexa is kind of like\nthe invocation word that it needs to\nkind of like start listening it was so\npopular this last December even just a\ncouple of months ago that Amazon ran out\nof stock a couple of times just because\nof the high high demand so maybe some of\nyou are wondering a speech recognition\nhas been around for decades so why is it\nonly just now hitting the mainstream and\nthen the reason really is is that deep\nlearning has finally improved so much\nand there's so much data available that\nit's accurate enough to be useful\noutside of carefully controlled\nenvironments so we can finally go\ncommercial even though speech\nrecognition has been around since the\n50s\nso us as developers uh why do we care we\ncare because this means that we can use\nspeech recognition in our own apps in\nour own code so I'm going to give quick\ndemo of this web speech API so this web\nspeech API is just as it says a web\nspeech API given by Google it's free and\nwe can use it it goes you don't use it\nin a Chrome bra\nthough and stoners apparently is\nautomatic there I don't know why but um\nif you just clicked this yeah it just\nworks it picks up what you're saying and\nit types it out a speech-to-text so\nGoogle has github for this project so\nit's called web platform samples and\nthen web speech demo and then we can go\nto F speech demo dot HTML this single\nHTML page has all the logic for what you\nsaw right here and then if you just look\nat the documents just about to CSS HTML\nthe real logic to this comes from right\nhere WebKit speech recognition in window\nand what this is doing is just checking\nto see at the web speech recognition is\nin the window and that's as I said\nbefore this is only compatible with the\nChrome browser so if it is available\nthen it gives it invokes that websites\nWebKit speech recognition and then it\ngives an object called recognition and\nit's on recognition that kind of like\nall the magic happens and then we can't\nchain functions and put things on to the\nrecognition object or activate the the\nfunctions that are already on it so\nrecognition not continuous and\nrecognitions interim results what these\nfunctions do is just enable the the text\nthe box here the web speech API to not\npause if I pause so as I even if I like\npause for a second between words the it\nwould still pick up and it wouldn't just\nstop and on star is when I start\nspeaking recognizing set is it true and\nthen it also sets this jiff to animate\nwhile I'm speaking so if you just see\nyou if I click this and I'm speaking\nyeah it's just it animates and there are\nother various other functions on the\nrecognition object on error on\nand just various things on results and\nthese are all kind of like boilerplate\nthings that you can just look and take\nfor your own project and it's all on\ngithub already provided by Google and\navailable for your Chrome browser and so\nspeech recognition has come a long way\nand just various applications we can use\nit for it now is this idea of a smart\nhome we could just say things and it\nwould just happen just hooking up our\nour home or physical home with Internet\nyeah also another benefit possibility of\nspeech recognition is people with\ndisabilities if for some reason they\ncan't type very well people can just use\nspeech as an interface instead of the\nkeyboard also with the advent and\npopularization of VR VR just lends\nitself to speech recognition and kind of\nyou just kind of expect speech\nrecognition to just work seamlessly when\nyou're in the VR experience\njust imagine Siri just a digital Siri\nand you just talk to her and be are so\nopportunities for developers tons of\nopportunities for developers because\nmachine learning and neural networks\nhelping to improve the quality of speech\nrecognition now is the time that it's\nreally taking off and becoming even more\nmainstream we're really in a unique\nperiod of history where it's like really\ntaking off and has it has a chance to\nintegrate integrate with a lot of new\ntechnologies like VR\nfor seamless experience\ncontribute Twitter's help contribute to\naccuracy and also just use your\nimagination and creativity for how you\ncan integrate speech recognition to\nwhatever app that you want to create in\nthe future so for the future maybe we'll\ncome to a point where like Ironman we\ncan come home and our own personal\nassistant voice the system can welcome\nus yeah thank you\n",
