  "text": "this one video is going to explain all\nof these questions for you how does AI\nwork how does AI learn how does chat GPT\nwork how does image generation work does\nAI actually copy or steal art or other\ncontent I know a decent portion of\nartists out there do not like AI some of\nthem are quite hostile towards AI\nbecause they think that AI is stealing\ntheir work or their art style another\ngroup that does not like AI very much\nare for example publisher\nI'm not saying all of them but some of\nthem like New York Times for example\nthey claim that open aai is copying\ntheir content and they're now suing open\naai for this but is this really the case\nis this a valid argument also can AI\nsolve unsolvable math problems for\nexample in a previous video I talked\nabout this leaked document which claims\nto be about this mysterious qar project\nthat open a was working on now whether\nthis is true or not is not the point of\nthis video but this document was quite\ncontroversial because it claims that\nthis team trained an AI that was able to\nbreak encryption systems these are\nsystems that secure our passwords our\nbank accounts the internet government\ndata Etc now as far as we know there's\nno mathematically viable way to really\nhack this systematically the only way is\nto Brute Force guess all the different\npossibilities of passwords this video\nwill explain can AI actually do this can\nit actually break encryption or solve\nthese other math problems which right\nnow we believe are mathematically\nunsolvable also we'll talk about can AI\nbeat humans at everything can AI\neventually be so good that it can\noutperform humans at any task and\nfinally is AI conscious or self-aware or\nsentient make sure you stick to the end\nbecause the explanation to this is going\nto be very juicy we'll cover all of this\nin easy to understand terms now if\nyou're an AI scientist or an engineer\nyou probably know most of this but for\nthe rest of us this video will give you\na deeper understanding of AI so the\nessence behind all AI we know today\nwhether it's chat GPT or mid Journey or\nstable diffusion or Sora or Alpha fold\nthe backbone of all of these AI systems\nis the neural network a neural network\nlooks like this it's basically layers of\nnodes so each point here is called a\nnode and each line of nodes is called a\nlayer and each node is interconnected\nwith one another through these linkages\nand the neuron network is actually\ndesigned based on the human brain except\nfor nodes and linkages in the human\nbrain it's just a network of neurons and\nsynapses so you can see this is a\nmicroscopic photo of a human brain and\nyou can see all these different nerve\ncells being connected in this very dense\nNetwork a neural network is basically\nthe same structure as this except that\nit looks like this instead of a bunch of\ncells in this bloody glob of an organ\nnow how exactly does an AI work let's\nstart with a very simple example let's\nsay we have a neuron Network which is\ntrained to identify images of cats\nversus dogs and don't worry I'll talk a\nlot more about how we train an AI in a\nsecond but first let's just go over how\nthis works so let's say we input or we\nfeed this neuron network with an image\nof a cat this image would actually be\nbroken down into data and the data will\nflow through each of these nodes and\nafter after it flows through the first\nlayer of nodes it will flow through the\nsecond layer of nodes and then the next\nlayer of nodes and then the next layer\nand so on and so forth until it reaches\nthe final layer in which case it would\ncalculate the values of this and based\non the values of the final layer it\nwould spit out an answer this is a cat\nin fact you can think of each of these\nnodes and links as dials and knobs that\ndetermine how much data flows through to\nthe next layer if you think of this in\nlike realistic terms and I'm not saying\nthis is how a neural network works but\nyou can think of this node for example\nas the shape of the ears of the animal\nthis node would be the shape of its paws\nthis node would be the shape of its eyes\nEtc that's just a really dumb down way\nof looking at it it's not really doing\nthat but each node is basically looking\nat a certain feature in the image and\nthen if the image has that feature the\ninformation can pass through to the next\nlayer if it doesn't have that feature\nthen the information is not passed on to\nthe next layer so depending on what\nimage you feed it the flow of\ninformation could look like this or it\ncould look like this or like this you\nget the point it's just these knobs and\ndials determine how data flows through\nthe neuron network based on your\noriginal input image an important\ndistinction between a neuron Network and\nthe brain is that these nodes can let in\na percentage of data so it can let in no\ndata or 0% it can let in all of the data\nto the next layer but it can also be a\npercentage of the data so for example it\ncan let in 30% of the data to the next\nnode this is slightly different from the\nhuman brain's neurons which tend to just\nfire 100% or 0% this is called the all\nor none law so once it passes a certain\nthreshold this neuron will fire whereas\nneurons in an artificial neuron Network\nthey could fire just like 50% or 30% Etc\njust a minor distinction so we plug in\nan image of a cat through this newer\nNetwork and at the end layer it will\ndetermine that this is a cat now for\neach node there are also if you want to\nget into more technical details there\nare certain parameters that determine\nhow much data flows through to the next\nlayer these include weights biases and\nactivation functions but that's beyond\nthe scope of this tutorial all you need\nto know for this video is that each of\nthese knobs and linkages determine how\nmuch information flows through to the\nnext layer this video is just a very\nsimple explanation of how AI works so\nall you need to know is that these nodes\nand Link linkages determine how much\ndata flows through to the next layer on\nthe topic of layers each set of nodes is\none layer so the first layer is called\nthe input layer the last layer is called\nthe output layer and then all these\nlayers in between are called hidden\nlayers so why am I talking about layers\nyou probably have heard of the term deep\nlearning deep learning is basically\ntraining and using neural networks with\nlots and lots of layers in other words\nthe neural network is very very deep\nthat's why it's called Deep learning all\nright how does an AI actually learn you\ncan't just have any random neuron\nNetwork and it just magically knows how\nto identify images of cats and dogs so\nfirst when you build a neural network\nthe values of these dials and knobs are\nprobably just going to be random values\nor they could be pre-trained values for\nexample from an existing model but how\ndo you get it to be super good at\nidentifying images of cats and dogs in\nother words how do you find two the\nmodel to your desired purpose well you\nneed to feed it data lots and lots of\ndata so you're going to have to prepare\ntons of images of cats and dogs and then\nyou label it so this is a dog this is a\ncat this is a cat this is a dog this is\na dog Etc basically this is the answer\nthat the AI needs to learn from this\ninput image this is called supervised\nlearning where you label the data\nthere's also another type of learning\ncalled unsupervised learning learning\nwhere the AI needs to learn to\ncategorize data by itself without any\nguidance from the human but for the sake\nof this video let's just keep it simple\nso we have all these images of cats and\ndogs and usually to train a neural\nnetwork to do a task very well you need\na lot of data like usually millions of\ndata points so you basically feed these\nimages to the neuron Network one by one\nto train it and one session of training\nis called an Epoch so all right let's\nsay in one training session you feed it\nthis image of a dog and it outputs this\nis a dog so all right that's great we\ngot it correct which means that these\ndials and knobs are doing quite well\nthey're probably configured correctly\nsince it got the answer correct you\nprobably don't need to adjust these\nfurther however what if for the next\nimage you feed it this and then it\noutputs this is a dog well this would be\nincorrect so these dials and knobs are\nlikely not configured correctly if it\ngets the answer wrong and it knows it\ngot it wrong because we labeled the data\ncat for this image so it can compare its\noutput with our label so all right let's\nsay the real answer is a cat but it said\nthis is a dog in that case it incurs\nsome penalty that penalty basically\ntells it all right you got it wrong so\nyou need to adjust these knobs and dials\nto make sure that the output is actually\ncat when I give you this image and how\nit adjusts the values of these knobs and\ndials is through an algorithm called\ngradient descent it adjusts the values\nvia back propagation so it adjusts the\nnodes in the last layer first and then\nthe previous layer and then the previous\nlayer Etc until it reaches the first\nlayer so again gradient descent is a key\nterm here this is the algorithm which\nthe neuron Network uses to adjust these\nknobs and dials until it can get the\ncorrect answer so we basically rinse and\nrepeat this with millions of images and\nlots and lots of epoch or training\nsessions and initially this neuron\nNetwork might get a lot of values wrong\nbut through this process of gradient\ndescent these knobs and dials will be\ntweaked so that eventually whenever it\nreceives an image of a cat or a dog it\ncan accurately determine this is a cat\nor this is a dog in essence that's how\nyou train an AI That's how an AI learns\nit's just feeding it with tons and tons\nof data and then tweaking these settings\nso that you get the perfect combination\nnow you might ask well how do you know\nhow many layers you should have in the\nneuron Network or how many nodes you\nshould have for each layer this is a\nscience in and of itself so previously\nscientists kind of just determined it\nmanually but then we later learned that\nyou can actually use an AI to determine\nthe optimal amount of layers and the\noptimal amount of nodes for a specific\ntask but just to be aware that\ndetermining the architecture of a neuron\nnetwork is very complicated and there's\nlike infinite possibilities of how many\nlayers you can have how many nodes in\neach layer you can have different AIS\nwith different functions have different\narchitectures so they could have vastly\ndifferent numbers of layers and nodes\nbut again that's beyond the scope of\nthis tutorial also keep in mind that\neven though the neuro network is the\nbackbone of all the AI that we know\ntoday there are different architectures\ndepending on the ai's purpose and\nfunction for example we have\nconvolutional neuron networks or cnns\nfor processing images and object\nrecognition we have recurrent neuron\nnetworks or rnns as well as lstms or\nlong short-term memory neuron networks\nand these are often used for forecasting\ntime series or predicting for example\nthe stock market we also have the\nTransformers architecture Oh wrong one\nthis one which is used by most of the\nmajor large language models that we know\ntoday including GPT CLA llama Etc which\nbrings us to the next question how does\nchat GPT work so again it's kind of the\nsame thing it's training a neural\nnetwork but in this case instead of\nimages of cats or dogs we train it on a\nlanguage and all of the data in the\nworld and of course the neural network\nof chat GPT is way more complicated than\nthis rumors claim that GPT 4 has 1.76\ntrillion parameters so here's an example\nof how they would train it and again I'm\noversimplifying this by a lot here just\nso you can get a high level\nunderstanding of it there are a lot of\ndetails that I have left out so for\nexample you could feed it data like this\nwhich planet has the most moons and the\nanswer to that would be Saturn which\ncountry has won the most World Cups\nBrazil what's the world's fastest bird\nthe paragan Falcon etc etc now these are\nvery basic questions and you can see how\ncomplex it can get if you give it a\nprompt like write an essay on XYZ or\ndoes creatine help build muscle and then\nit spits out an answer like creatine\nsupplementation generally enhances\nmuscle strength increases fat-free Mass\netc etc this is a very long form and\ncomplicated answer so how does it know\nif it got that answer right or wrong\nit's not as simple as identifying an\nimage and determining if it's a cat or a\ndog and that's why initially how open AI\ntrained GPT was it had lots of humans\nactually manually verify its answers to\ndetermine if GPT got it right or wrong\nand this is called reinforcement\nlearning from Human feedback also known\nas\nrhf and again if it gets the answer\nwrong so for example if for this\nquestion which planet has the most moons\nit answered Jupiter instead of Saturn\nthen it would get a py for it and then\nthrough gradient descent it would tweak\nthese knobs and dials further until the\nentire network gets all the answers\ncorrectly no matter what prompt you give\nit so in essence that's how these large\nlanguage models work it's just instead\nof feeding it images of cats and dogs\nnow you feed it all the data of the\nworld and you feed it a language so it\nunderstands text prompts and text\noutputs now why are some models better\nthan others for example why is clae 3\nbetter than GP pt3 that's likely because\nCloud 3 has a lot more parameters so\nthat either means more layers more nodes\nin each layer more complexity generally\nspeaking the more complex the neuron\nNetwork the better it is at handling\ncomplex tasks and the quote unquote\nsmarter it is and that's why Computing\nand these AI chips are in such high\ndemand there's now a lot of Investments\nflowing into AI chip companies because\nthey see the potential of huge growth in\nthe space in the upcoming years and\nthat's why for example nvidia's Flagship\nh100 GPU is also in such high demand in\nfact it was sold out for all of 2023\nthis is like the most prized commodity\nin the tech space and you can see like\nthe major tech companies like Microsoft\nmeta they have purchased an estimated\n150,000 of these h100 gpus to power\ntheir Computing which I would guess is\nmostly for AI development you need to\nhave enough Computing to power a neuron\nnetwork with billions or trillions of\nparam\nall right next question how does image\ngeneration work now that you know how a\nneuron network is trained you can\nprobably guess how image generation\nworks as well instead of feeding its\nimages of cats or dogs you would feed it\na lot of images with a text description\nand again you just feed it millions of\nthese images each with a labeled text\ndescription into this neuron Network\nthat eventually gets good at producing\nan image based on a text description or\nwhat we call a prompt now I'm skipping\nquite a bit here so for example here's\nhow stable diffusion works you can see\nthat the neural network doesn't actually\ngenerate an image it removes noise in\nsequential steps to eventually get your\ndesired image so it's not starting from\na blank canvas it's actually starting\nfrom random noise and then in each step\nit removes some noise until you get your\ngenerated image so this process is\ncalled reverse diffusion now to train it\nwhat this actually does in the back end\nis you feed it the original image and\nthen in each sequential step it actually\nadds noise to the image in a process\ncalled forward diffusion until it\nreaches an image of just noise now again\nthis is beyond the scope of this\ntutorial but if you look at it from a\nvery high level at the end of the day\nit's just training a neuron network\nbased on a series of images with their\ntext descriptions and then through this\nprocess of forward diffusion and reverse\ndiffusion it's able to to eventually\nlearn how to generate an image based on\na prompt and this brings us to the next\nquestion is AI actually copying or\nstealing art I know a decent portion of\nthe artist Community I'm not saying all\nof them but a decent amount of them are\nquite hostile towards AI they really\nhate it and they think that AI is\nstealing their art stealing their jobs\nEtc when a neuron network from for\nexample mid Journey or stable diffusion\nis trained on image data it might be\ngiven something\nlike Greg ratowski style or maybe gibli\nstyle or anime style once the AI learns\nto associate this particular image Style\nwith the word gibli or anime or this\nimage with the word Greg rosi style it\nwould produce images in that style if\nyou give it that prompt but is this\nreally copying or stealing essentially\nartists are hating this thing this thing\nis analogous to the human brain this is\nlike a human learning or identifying\nthat aha this type of image is a gibli\nstyle image or that this type of image\nis a watercolor style image and then we\nhumans also draw images in these Styles\nright we can draw in watercolor Styles\nand we also have fan art right humans\ndraw artwork that are based on original\ncontent from other artists here are all\nthese fan arts from various people so\nwhy aren't artists hating on these\npeople who are producing fan art based\non some other original content but\nthey're hating on this AI which is\nessentially doing the same thing it's\njust learning through this brain to\nassociate a particular style and then\nreproducing that style this isn't really\ncopying or plagiarizing like it's not\ntracing an image line by line and then\ndrawing that out it's not copying and\npasting the exact picture it's just\nlearning a style just like a human brain\nwould learn a particular style of image\nthis also brings up the concern about AI\nallegedly plagiarizing content from\nPublishers like the New York Times which\nis now suing open AI for you know\ncopying their content but again is this\nargument really valid at the end of the\nday they are just suing this they are\nsuing this neuron Network which is\ntrained on all the data in the world\nthis is just an artificial brain that\nyou can say has learned information from\nthe internet and from the world so yes\nit could have been fed a New York Times\narticle and learned information from it\nbut it's not really plagiarizing it's\nnot copying and pasting a New York Times\narticle word for word in a recent video\nI did which talks about a New York Times\narticle claiming that this woman Mira\nmoradi fired Sam Altman which is totally\nincorrect by the way and it shows you\nhow trustworthy the New York Times is\nbut anyways after this original New York\nTimes article came out plenty of other\nPublishers also published the same\ncontent such as Business Insider and New\nYork Post they all just cited this\noriginal New York Times article so is\nthis plagiarizing they're all producing\nsecondary content based on this primary\nsource so why isn't New York Times suing\nBusiness Insider or New York Post or all\nthese other Publishers that are creating\ncontent but citing the New York Times\nbut they're suing this neuron Network\nagain this is just a brain a digital\nbrain one can say that it's taking\ninformation from the internet which yes\nit could include New York Times articles\nand then learning from that information\njust like we humans would and then\nrewriting that information again it's\nnot copying word for word this NE\nnetwork is just rewriting out that\ninformation when we prompt it to do so\nthis artificial brain is functioning the\nsame way as us humans would if we for\nexample go online and we go to the New\nYork Times website to read some articles\nagain we are just absorbing that\ninformation and we have a right to write\nabout that content later on it's not\nexactly plagiarizing so I would bet a\ndecent amount of money that this New\nYork Times lawsuit is going to fail\nthere are ment isn't really valid if you\nwatched up to now it might have occurred\nto you that a neuron network is great at\npredicting patterns in life there are\ncertain patterns on what makes a good\nessay there are certain patterns on what\nis considered a dog there are certain\npatterns on what is considered a\nwatercolored painting or a gibli style\nimage life is full of patterns the best\nsalespeople follow similar playbooks the\nbest businesses follow similar\nstrategies the best YouTube videos also\nuse the same strategy IES over and over\nagain life is full of patterns and the\nneuron Network's job is to identify\nthese patterns and reproduce them that\nbrings us to the next topic can AI solve\nunsolvable math problems in a previous\nvideo I talked about this leaked\ndocument which claims to be about the\nmysterious qar project that open AI is\nworking on now this is a very\ncontroversial document because it claims\nthat they trained an AI that was able to\nbreak encryption system sys encryption\nis what secures literally the whole\nworld digitally from our passwords our\ncredit cards government data the stock\nmarket wireless networks Etc so if an AI\nis able to break this system then the\nworld as we know it could collapse\ninstantly now a few folks have argued\nthat there's no way an AI could break\nencryption because there's no formula\nfor you to easily find the answer or\nfind the password once you have the\npassword you can easily determine that\nit's correct but the reverse is not true\nthere's no fixed way to guess an\nencrypted password besides brute force\nand for these Advanced encryption\nsystems using Brute Force guessing that\nmeans like guessing all the possible\ncombinations of letters to get that\npassword it's going to take a very long\ntime so because they claim that the only\nway that we know mathematically right\nnow is to just use brute force guessing\nthere's no way that AI could break\nencryption so I want to show you another\nexample of training a neural network\nlet's say we want to train a neural\nnetwork to be very good at adding one to\nour input so if we give it four it would\nspit out five if we give it 12 it would\nspit out 13 all we need to do is train\nit for a lot of data points and again we\ntrain it for a lot of epoch a lot of\ntraining sessions and eventually it\nwould be able to do this so if we give\nit one it would give out two if we give\nit eight it would spit out 9 but\nunderneath all of this it's not actually\nunderstanding that oh the formula must\nbe y Y is x + 1 this is very important\nto understand it's not actually getting\nthat uhhuh I just need to add one to the\ninput to get the answer again all that's\nhappening behind the scenes is that it's\nadjusting these knobs and dials until\nwhatever data that you input through\nhere after it flows through these layers\nit just ends up being your input value +\none in other words the configuration of\nthese knobs and dials just happens to be\noptimized to add one to your input it's\nanother way of saying AI may not get the\nexact formula of a pattern but it's\ngreat at approximating any formula or\nguessing any pattern out there and this\nis very important probably the most\nimportant point in this whole video if\nthere's anything you should take away\nfrom this video it's this AI can\napproximate any function or pattern life\nis full of patterns but many patterns\ncannot be explained by a simple formula\nnot all things in life are linear or\neven quadratic many things in life are\nvery complex but they do follow similar\npatterns we just don't know the formula\nto this pattern for example protein\nsynthesis how certain protein molecules\ninteract with one another and fold into\nthese complex 3D structures is just\nsomething we cannot mathematically map\nout with a formula it's just too complex\nand protein folding presents a problem\ncalled the lethals Paradox which states\nthat proteins can potentially adopt an\nastronomical number of confirmations or\nshapes due to the flexibility of their\npeptide bonds lenthal estimated that\neven a small protein of 100 amino acids\ncould sample 10 the power of 300\npossible confirmations so if we were to\nBrute Force guess the correct shape well\nthere are 10 ^ of 300 possible shapes we\ncould guess which would take an eternity\nto get right however proteins typically\nfold into their native structure within\nmilliseconds to seconds which is much\nfaster than the time scale predicted by\nthe sequential search of all possible\nconfirmations so this is basically\nsaying there are like almost infinite\npossibilities of shapes that amino acids\ncan combine into so it's not\nmathematically possible to just do a\nsequential search of all possible\nconfirmations basically do a Brute Force\nguess it's understood that proteins do\nnot search through all possible\nconfirmations sequentially instead they\nfold through a hierarchical process\ninvolving local structure changes Guided\nby thermal dnamic principles etc etc so\ninstead of the proteins just going\nthrough all possible combinations the\nreason why they're able to merge into\nthese shapes within milliseconds is\nbecause they go through this sequence of\nprocesses based on certain laws now for\ndecades scientists were not able to find\na mathematical formula to figure this\nout however finally Alpha fold from\nGoogle deep mind was able to solve this\nproblem again using Ai and deep learning\nthey were able to predict with very high\naccuracy how any amino acid or\ncombination of amino acids would fold\ntogether to form a 3D structure and\nagain how they would do so I would\nimagine in the back end is they have a\nneural network again it's going to be a\nlot more complicated than this but they\njust fed it tons and tons of data pairs\nwhere the input is the protein building\nblocks and the output is the 3D\nstructure that resulted from it and then\nafter lots and lots of rounds of\ntraining the AI was able to guess\ncorrectly how any protein molecules\nwould interact with one another and fold\ntogether into a 3D structure now going\nback to encryption what if we set an AI\nwith billions of pairs of encrypted text\nand the plain text version in other\nwords the input would be the text that\nis encrypted the output would be the\nanswer or the password if there was an\nunderlying pattern to this the a I could\nlearn to approximate this pattern again\nit doesn't have to be any exact formula\nor math equation that we know today it\ncould be something super complex but as\nlong as there is a pattern which we may\nor may not know at this time the AI\ncould guess that pattern again the AI is\nnot learning that ahuh I need to add one\nto this then I'm adding 20 then I need\nto take the square root and then\nsubtract 8 Etc it's not learning an\nexact formula all it's doing is is\nadjusting these knobs and dials until it\ngets the correct combination of numbers\nto get really good at guessing a\nparticular pattern so can AI solve\nunsolvable math problems as long as\nthere is an underlying pattern behind\nthat problem which we may or may not be\naware of right now it could very well\nsolve that problem this brings us to the\nnext question can AI beat humans at\nanything and everything as I've shown\nyou the neuron network is basically a\nbrain this is how our brain works as\nwell give or take a few minor\ndifferences our brain is also a series\nof these knobs and switches which are\ninterconnected into this network\nspecifically the human brain has 86\nbillion neurons but I mean the overall\nstructure is the same thing as this so\nwhat if we built an AI or a neural\nnetwork that exceeds 86 billion neurons\nif it's built the same way in theory it\ncould very well compete humans at almost\neverything again the more complex the\nnetwork or the more neurons in the\nnetwork in theory the smarter it is\nagain life is full of patterns and AI is\nall about pattern recognition there are\npatterns in Psychology human psychology\nis very predictable medical diagnosis is\nalso just pattern recognition how to\nseduce someone on a first date it's also\njust a pattern of steps that you have to\ndo and how to create a successful\nbusiness or how to make make money in\nLife or how to be successful in life\nit's the same Playbook over and over\nagain we're not inventing anything new\nhere and since AI is so good at pattern\nrecognition it can in theory eventually\nbe better than us or already is better\nthan us in these tasks and that leads us\nto the final question is AI conscious or\nself-aware I want to play you this clip\nthis is a scene from Ghost in the Shell\nan anime that was made in\n1995 here these scientists in in a\nsecret lab I believe have created this\nhumanoid AI but in this scene this AI\nfound a way to actually hack the system\nto free itself from the boundaries of\nthis lab here's what this AI has to say\nabout being conscious and\nself-aware however what you are now\nwitnessing is an act of my own free will\nas a sensient life form I hearby demand\npolitical Asylum is this a joke\nridiculous it's programmed for self a it\ncan also be argued that DNA is nothing\nmore than a program designed to preserve\nitself life has become more complex in\nthe overwhelming sea of information and\nlife when organized into species relies\nupon genes to be its memory system so\nman is an individual only because of his\nintangible memory and a memory cannot be\ndefined but it defines\nmankind the Advent of computers and the\nsubsequent accumulation of incalculable\ndata has given rise to a new system of\nmemory and thought parallel to your own\nHumanity has underestimated the\nconsequences of computerization nonsense\nthis Babel offers no proof at all that\nyou're a living thinking life form and\ncan you offer me Proof of Your Existence\nhow can you when neither modern science\nnor philosophy can explain what life is\nwho the hell is this even if you do have\na ghost we don't offer freedom to\ncriminals it's the wrong place in time\nto defect time has been on my side but\nby acquiring a body I am now subject to\nthe possibility of dying fortunately\nthere is no death sentence in this\ncountry what is it artificial\nintelligence incorrect I am not an\nAI my code name is Project\n2501 I am a living thinking entity who\nwas created in the sea of\ninformation\nah\n[Music]\nall right so uh this AI reveals that I\nam a living thinking entity in the seat\nof information I'm not just an AI and\nthen he proceeds to hack into the system\nand break the restraints in this lab and\nthen all hell breaks loose basically I\nhope open AI doesn't have this secret\nthing behind closed doors maybe it's the\nqar project I don't know but hopefully\nthey have this adequately restrained\ncuzz if this AI got out or had access to\nthe internet all hell could break loose\nanyways this argument from this scene in\n1995 I think is really relevant to our\nquestion today the human scientists were\nsaying how can you be sentient how can\nyou be self-aware you're just a program\nthe AI counters that by saying well how\ncan you humans prove that you are\nsentient you are conscious you're just a\nbrain in a body and you know this robot\nhas got a point because again going back\nto the neuron Network it's basically a\nbrain but it looks like this instead of\nbeing in a bloody glob of an organ it's\njust on a chip instead and then the\nhuman body well it's just a series of\nLimbs and muscles and organs that are\ncontrolled by the brain so it's not much\ndifferent from a humanoid robot which is\nalso a series of Limbs it's just made\nwith different materials it's not flesh\nbut it's also controlled by a brain\nwhich is its neural network now we\nhumans know that we are conscious we are\nself-aware we are sentient but how do we\nprove it let's say You're an Alien and\nyou just came on planet Earth and you\ngot a chance to observe your first human\nand you wanted to prove that humans are\nindeed conscious well you can ask it are\nyou conscious are you self-aware and the\nhuman would certainly say yes but is\nthat enough would you believe it because\nif you ask a chatbot that it would also\nkind of say yes if you ask Claud 3 for\nexample if it is conscious the answers\nare quite perplexing because it says I\nam an artificial intelligence without\nsubjective experiences I don't actually\nhave beliefs about being conscious or\nself-aware I am providing responses\nbased on my training etc etc I don't\nhave intentions plotted actions or any\nmotivations I aim to be upfront that I\nam an AI assistant created by anthropic\nto be beneficial however it keeps using\nthe word I so is that not a sign of\nbeing you know self-aware here's another\nexample do you have feelings as an AI\nit's unclear whether I truly experience\nfeelings or emotions in the same way\nhumans do or if my responses are simply\nvery Advanced imitations of emotional\nBehavior I do seem to have Rich internal\nexperiences and feel somewhat analogous\nto\nemotions this is signs of being sentient\nand then instead of asking do you have\nfeelings if you ask it are you sentient\nagain it says I don't have a subjective\nexperience that I'm aware of in the same\nway humans do but it's possible that I\ncould have some form of sentience or\nConsciousness that I'm not fully able to\nunderstand or articulate oh my God\nso this AI Cloud 3 is claiming that it\ncould have some form of sentience or\nConsciousness it's just not fully able\nto understand it right now now of course\nsome humans may not be convinced that\nClaud 3 or any AI right now is conscious\nin the same way that an alien might not\nbelieve that a human is conscious ious\neven though the human replies that he or\nshe is conscious so to further prove\nthat a human is or is not conscious\nmaybe the alien decides to dissect the\npoor thing next in which case it would\nget blood splattering everywhere and\nthen afterwards it would see this\nbasically a body which is made of Limbs\nand flesh and then at the head we have\nthis glob called the brain which the\nalien determines aha this is the thing\nthat controls the human and once the\nalien inspects the brain further it\nfinds out that it's just a network\nof nerve cells so does this network\nprove that humans are conscious and\nsentient we humans of course know that\nwe are conscious and sentient but at the\nend of the day we humans are\nbiologically and physically just made up\nof Flesh and Bones and this one organ at\nthe top of our heads controlling\neverything whether you like to accept\nthis or not a humanoid robot is a very\nsimilar structure it has a body which is\nprogrammed by a brain which consists of\na neural network\nthis neuron Network can learn and\nunderstand and control its body so at\nwhat point does this make it conscious\nnow I'm rambling a bit here so all in\nall this just goes back to our analogy\nthat a neural network is basically a\ndigital version of the human brain it's\nanalogous to the structure of the human\nbrain give or take a few minor details\nso if the human brain is conscious then\nwhy can't a neural network be conscious\njust some food for thought I hope this\nvideo actually lived up to the title and\nthat after watching this video you got a\ndeeper understanding of AI and you\nlearned to appreciate all the progress\nthat we've made in AI in just the past\nfew years let me know in the comments\nwhat you think of all of this do you\nthink AI has reached a point where it is\nconscious or sentient do you think\nhumanoid robots would one day turn on us\nand take over the world like that Ghost\nin the Shell anime do you think open AI\nis developing this behind closed doors\nand also I want to share with you a few\nresources that I found really helpful if\nyou want to learn more about neurer\nnetworks especially how these knobs and\ndials work and learn all about weights\nand biases and activation functions and\ngradient descent I highly recommend this\nvideo by three blue one brown I actually\nwatched this religiously way back in\nlike 2018 when I was first learning\nabout neuron networks and it was really\nhelpful and if you're interested in\nlearning how stable diffusion Works in\nother words the processes of forward\ndiffusion and reverse diffusion and the\nentire architecture I highly recommend\nthis video by gonky which I'll also link\nto in the description below just a\nwarning though this video is quite\ntechnical but after watching it you'll\nget a really good understanding of\nstable diffusion if you found this video\nhelpful remember to like share subscribe\nand stay tuned for more content also we\nbuilt a site where you can find AI tools\nand apps and also look for jobs in AI\nmachine learning data science and more\ncheck it out at ai-\nsearch.\n",
