  "text": "cyber security is one of the most\npopular career options in IT industry\nbut landing a job in cyber security it's\nnot that easy you need to build a very\nstrong resume with very strong points\nincluding education degree projects and\ncertifications and certifications are\namong the most important criteria for\nany HR or a manager to select the\nrightful candidate for his most\nprestigious cyber security job in big\ncompanies that will show the right\nskills and expertise that you have in\nthis field so in this video I'm going to\ntalk about top five cyber security\ncertifications and my picks in order for\nyou to land a job in cyber security and\nKickstart your career in cyber security\nso let's get started we keep hearing\nthis fact from many people in it that\ncyber security is biggest market right\nnow and it's only going to Boom but how\nmany people are getting supplied many\npeople are getting supplied but there is\nan imbalance between the supply and\ndemand only because the supply that we\nare getting is not rightfully skilled we\ngot a lot of candidates but are they\nactually skilled to what the industry\nwant\naccording to a trusted survey there will\nbe million job opportunities and\nopenings by 2023 in India itself but if\nyou want to land a job and a good job\nyou need to be skilled to the core and\nyeah I know you might have this question\nthat people ask me very often for\nlearning why do certifications why not\ndegrees why not colleges so the fact is\nthat College learning is not many times\nnot very often at par with what industry\ndemands there is a huge gap you may not\neven be able to learn cyber security in\nyour college studies that's the truth\nbut in order to be good in this field\nyou need to be adaptive you need to\nadapt at a pace that is not very often\nkept up in college degree programs\nsyllabus don't very often change in this\ndegree programs while I do recommend\npeople to get at least one bachelor's\ndegree in CS or it but certifications\nare the best way to boost your resume\nand skills at the same time because they\ntake very less time they just focus on\none important Niche and go deep into it\nand they generally don't cost you as\nmuch as a degree while degree can cost\nyou in lacks maybe 10 or more but a\ncertification will not cost you more\nthan a lack or two and in a degree you\ntaught many more things that you don't\neven need in your career that you want\nto pursue but a certification will give\nyou a path to follow in your future so\nhere are my picks for the top five\ncertifications in cyber security that\nwill give you a good position in top\ncompany and your dream job so I'll try\nto list them in order of the experience\nlevel so the very first certifications\nthat you will and you should do a c\ncertified ethical hacker this is the\nmost basic course that you can do that\nwill build the very fundamentals of you\nunderstanding how attacks work how to\nfind issues in hacking a system this is\nthe bare minimum that everyone should do\nin order to get started to get to know\nwhat this field looks like so people\nknew into this field and just want to\nstart their career as a fresher I think\nthis is one of the best certifications\nto do I know many people don't count it\nas worth because it's lacking very\nHands-On training on real world\nscenarios but at the end of the day it's\na building block and it gives you a mark\nof a certified hacker and still HRS in\nIndia look for this badge at the bare\nminimum in many cases so you can be hir\nas a pentester or a security analyst and\nthen break the barrier of experience\nonce and for all and while you work you\ncan focus on your skill set and build\nand do more certifications in the future\nand just keep growing I know it's\ndifficult to manage skill development\nwhen you work full-time even I face the\nsame especially when you are doing it on\nyour own in self- learning well well\nwell I know a program that can make you\na certified ethical hacker while you\nstudy and guide you on your learning I'm\ntalking about simply learns\npost-graduate program in cyber security\nthat is backed by top expert study\nprograms and faculty from MIT schwas man\nCollege of computing and even EC Council\nthe program is an online boot camp that\nruns for 6 months where you will learn\nfrom industry experts how to design\nbuild and Implement secure systems at\nscale in large scale organizations the\ncourse covers 20 of the most popular and\nimportant security domains and how to\napply best practices in all of them and\nit is also aligned with compt Security\nPlus and will teach all the standards\ncovered there it will also teach you how\nto develop a hacker mindset identify and\nmanage threats and also the overall\nsecurity posture of large scale\norganizations at the end of The Learning\nyou will get a Capstone project where\nyou you will apply your industry skills\nand you will get a chance to Showcase\nyour expertise to Future employers you\nwill also get access to EC council's\nlearning kit and C V12 iaps access for 6\nmonths along with an exam voucher which\nwill make you a certified ethical hacker\nwhile you study and you will also get a\ncertificate from MIT shwas man College\nof computing that is really valuable in\nyour resume so to be eligible for this\nprogram you should have a bachelor's\ndegree with 50% or more of grades and\nyou need not have any programming\nexperience or any prior work experience\nso the application for this program is\nreally very simple just go to the link\nin the description click on the link\nreview all the program details click on\napply Now button on the page fill all\nthe required details asked from you and\njust submit and wait for the r back and\nI know there are not many good programs\nout there that can offer you so much at\nthe same time so don't think just go for\nit the second search is coma Security\nPlus I know C is very popular in India\nbut if you talk about all around the\nworld coma has done really good job in\nestablishing a foothold in this industry\nthis is also a basic certification made\nfor beginners which will teach you how\nto secure network systems and\napplications it's more on the security\nside rather than the offensive side and\nit's greatly aligned to Modern\nEnterprise environment and in demand\ntopics that CH in some way fails to\ncover including Cloud mobile and iot it\nalso covers governance risk and\ncompliance but yeah many people will\nthink that we still require practical\ncertifications but this is also a\ntheoretical certifications that will\nhave 90 performance-based questions that\nare not straightforward that will check\nyour concept overall what you have\nlearned but still is theoretical but if\nyou want to get a job in foreign in us\nor in UK or anywhere around the world\nit's one of the most recognized\ncertifications out there you can be\nhired as a security engineer Cloud\nengineer IT Auditor with a very\ncompetent package the third one is GC or\nGAC certified security engineer those\nwho are already working in corporate\nworld may already know that sci is one\nof the top and one of the best trainers\nin the world out there and I personally\ndone gpan and I know that the knowledge\nthat you get there is nowhere else the\ntop experts from each field come out and\nteach and of course that comes with a\ncost GC is one of the best selling\ncertifications GAC has to offer it will\nteach you active defense techniques\nnetwork security Cloud security incident\nresponse forensic so it is one of the\nbest certifications for blue teaming and\nthe salary hike here is real I can tell\nyou from my personal experience if your\nbase is low you can easily get a 50%\nhike if your base is high then you can\neasily get 30 40% hike but the catch\nhere is I think not many individuals can\nafford this because the cost is really\nvery high it can even go to 7 to 8 laks\nfor a single training and certification\nso you can only do that if you're\nemployer sponsors you so if your\nemployer has a good bank balance and is\ngood enough you will want to do science\ntraining again and again and again\nfourth one is cisa or certified\ninformation security auditor risk and\ncompliance are a very crucial aspect of\ncyber security in today's world\nespecially if you working in an\norganization that deals with sensitive\ncustomer data like Health finance and\ngovernment agencies so isaka comes up\nwith this credential that will focus on\nhow to assess security vulnerabilities\nhow to report and identify risk and\nmanage compliance according to various\nstandards based on the customer data in\nthe Department Industry they are in you\nmust have heard about some data\nstandards like pcss ISO or heppa they\nall come around this and this is one of\nthe best certification that you can do\nfor a governance risk and compliance job\nor a GRC or an auditor risk manager or a\ncyber audit manager and the truth is\ncyber Auditors are more respected than\npesters because they are more wise in\ndecision- making and they have a good\ngrip and understanding of how to assess\nbusiness risk but this certification\nrequires some prior experience in it\nAssurance so if you want to switch into\nauditing then you can definitely take\nthis the fifth one is\ncisp or cisp or certified information\nsystem security professional and this is\nno doubt one of the best or maybe the\nbest the most prestigious certification\nin all of infosec earning which you will\nbe able to run complex Security Programs\nand manage them just what cesos and\nmanagers and directors do you will be\ncapable of running a complete cyber\nsecurity program right from design\nanalysis implementation and managing a\ncomplete infos departments that just not\nincludes technical expertise but also\nmanagement expertise because that's what\nyou learn here and I can tell you the\nsalaries here are way more than what we\ndesire seriously it is meant for\nexperienced professionals with at least\n5 years of professional work experience\nin infosec and have a bachelor's degree\nbut here if I talk about salaries they\ncan easily go to 50 LPA and even beyond\n50l for a ceso and you can even work as\na security consultant for world's top\norganizations with a package only above\ncompetition so these are my top picks\nfor cyber security certifications in\n2023 that you can do in order to get\nstarted in a cyber security career or\neven get eventually good and experienced\nand switch over to different fields if\nyou are experienced so I hope you like\nthis video and you got something\nvaluable to learn from this and don't\nforget to enroll into simply learns\npostgraduate program in cyber security\nthat will give you industry guidance\nskills and also certifications at the\nsame time and do share this video with\nsomebody that you feel might be\nbenefited from this just like you did so\nthat's all in this video from my side I\nhope to see you again till then keep\nlearning and goodbye\n",
