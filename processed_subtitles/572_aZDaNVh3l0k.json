  "text": "Hey everyone. Today, let's talk about \nRPA, or Robotic Process Automation.  \nIn my opinion, the definition lies \nmore in the terms process automation  \nand less than actual robots. But RPA is changing \nthe software world much like physical robots have  \nchanged the world that we live in every \nday. For example, take a vending machine,  \nthere's not a person standing there sorting \nall your money and bending the goods it's  \nautomated because it's a tedious task. Now RPA \nis doing the same thing in the software world  \nfor tedious repetitive tasks. But for things \nlike IT, or even Business Process Management,  \nRPA is not going to help and that's because \nthese require more specialized skills.  \nSo where can RPA assist? Well let's start with an \nexample inspired by one of my favorite TV shows.  \nLet's say we've got a disgruntled employee, \nwe're going to call him Pete. Now Pete has  \nto take a number of documents that are stored \nyou know digitally and then convert them into  \nforms that he then has to file. So this is a very \ntedious task so he has to take all of these forms,  \nwrite them out manually, and then \nfinally actually go and file them.  \nSo this process let's see has to do this you know \n10,000 times. That means, you know Pete's going  \nto be pretty unhappy about this because this is a \nvery tedious repetitive task it's something that  \nyou know with RPA he could actually automate. So, \nlet's see what Pete would do if he wanted to set  \nup an automation to do this flow. So the first \nthing he has to do is identify what's the data,  \nwhere is it coming from. So in this \nparticular example the data is already in  \na computer somewhere and let's say that's coming \nin through email, or maybe his co-worker Kelly  \nis manually inputting them from you know phone \ncalls with customers. So they take the customer  \nforms they they put them into the computer. Now \nPete has to extract data, right. So that's going  \nto be the first thing that RPA can help with. Now, \nso with OCR, or Optical Character Recognition,  \nalong with the data that's in the computer Pete's \nable to pull out data and what he's going to do  \nis actually extract that data for further \nprocessing. So that data can be things like  \nthe customer's name and the info, let's say \nin the customer form it's the complaints that  \nmake up that information. So taking that data \nso the next thing Pete's going to do is let's  \nsay validate it so make sure that none of the data \nis corrupt and you know all the data looks good.  \nFinally he has to input it into a digital \nform. So he puts it into a digital form  \nand finally he sends it off to a printer. Now at \nthis phase all Pete really has to do is take the  \nfinal forms that are printed out and then file \nthem and that's going to be a whole lot easier  \nto do than doing this manually for all 10,000 \ncustomer complaint forms that are coming in.  \nSo that's where RPA can really assist with tedious \nrepetitive tasks that require things like clicking  \nthrough user interfaces, copying and pasting data, \nor kind of other things like Optical Character  \nRecognition where you have to extract data. So, \nwhen choosing an RPA solution which is going to  \nenable you to do this type of automation, I'd say \nthere's four major things that you really need to  \nbe looking for. Now the first one I'm going to \nstart with you want to make sure that your RPA  \ntool is intelligent. Now in this particular flow, \nPete used a lot of capabilities so he used OCR,  \nOptical Character Recognition, in addition he \nused different data manipulation techniques.  \nSo this enables Pete to do things \nlike extract, input data, validate it,  \nand finally he even had a function to be able \nto print something out create a physical piece  \nof paper from a software-based automation. \nThat's just scratching the tip of what Robot  \nRPA can do today. So, another thing RPA can \ndo is things like AI or machine learning to  \ntrain a model to recognize not just you know \nsimple characters, but maybe even images. So,  \nthat's something that Pete might want to \naugment this automation with in the future.  \nSo, that's one thing you want to make \nsure is that your RPA tool is intelligent.  \nNumber two, low code. So, RPA is really only going \nto be effective if the users that are creating  \nthese automation find that process to be easy, \notherwise management might choose to actually just  \nhave their employees do it manually if creating \nthis type of automation was too time consuming.  \nSo, a low code RPA environment is going to \nenable Pete to do things like drag and drop  \ncomponents and have minimal touch to actually \nget this automation created end to end.  \nNumber three, concurrency. So this is going \nto be the ability to run multiple robots at  \nthe same time, multiple automation tasks. \nSo, for the 10,000 customer complaint forms,  \nsay this task takes 15 seconds, that's a lot of \ntime. So, imagine if you could launch multiple  \nrobots and divvy up that work well you could get \nthrough the task at hand much more quickly. So an  \nRPA solution should have concurrency support. And \nthe last one I want to mention here is RPA as a  \nService. Now an \"as a Service\" model is going \nto come with a number of advantages. For one,  \nit's going to give you shorter time to value and \nthat's because Pete doesn't have to worry about  \nspinning up his own infrastructure, installing \nthe software, managing that environment, he can  \njust log in and start building these automations \nright away. That brings me to my next point,  \ncurrency, so not concurrency, but currency, which \nis keeping up with the latest versions that are  \navailable. So RPA and the world of RPA is changing \nquite rapidly and so with some of the intelligent  \ncapabilities enabled within RPA, say a new \nversion of OCR comes out and he wants to use it,  \nwell with an RPA as a Service capability you \ncan get updates more quickly, you're more  \ncurrent with the latest versions of software. \nSo you get to use those latest components and  \nmaybe OCR 2.0 kind of helps fix some of the bugs \nwith pulling data from customer complaint forms.  \nFinally, I think the last one that I want to \nmention here is that it allows you to collaborate.  \nSo imagine that Pete builds this automation, \npublishes it, and then now wants to share it with  \nthe the Nashua branch of this company so that \nthey can take advantage of the same process  \nto automate this flow and kind of file customer \ncomplaint forms. So \"as a Service\" environments  \ngenerally are multi-tenant and enable \nyou to collaborate with your co-workers.  \nSo, this was a quick overview of RPA. RPA \ntools are quickly growing in popularity,  \nand so is the scope of what RPA is able to \nactually automate.

Thank you. RPA is growing  \nvery rapidly and the scope of what RPA is able to \nautomate is also growing rapidly.
