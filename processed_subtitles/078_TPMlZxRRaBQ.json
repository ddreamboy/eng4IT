  "text": "hello everyone and welcome to this\ntutorial on tableau for data science\nwe're going to cover a few basic\nfeatures of tableau and how\ni use it for data science and how it can\nkind of fit into your workflow\nhere's an example of a data science\nworkflow\nwe have\nin this example six different components\nand this is going to be different you\nknow depending on what type of\nenvironment you're working in but\ngenerally you're going to have\nthe data collection data exploration\nthrough the data wrangling\ndata munching stage where you have to\npull everything together and clean it\nfor modeling\nand then the next step would be\nmodeling\nvalidation and then reporting\nso\nthe way i use tableau primarily is\nin the exploration phase and then in the\nreporting phase so expiration i want to\nbasically be able to look at the data\nonce i collect it i want to be able to\nlook\nat the different variables that exist i\nwant to see\nyou know how the data is\num\ndistributed for example for each\nvariable i want to see if there's any\noutliers or anything like that that i\nwant to kick out\nfrom\nthe uh the modeling because you know if\nyou feed bad data into this model\nyou're going to get some\nyou know your garbage in garbage out so\nbeing able to explore the data\ni find is is really helpful\nand sometimes that's really all you need\nto know if you should move forward or\nnot you know if\nyou're trying to look to see if there's\nsome kind of a relationship between\nvariables\nsometimes a quick exploration and\ntableau a nice visual will help give you\nthat and then also in the reporting side\nso once you've built your model\nyou validated it and you want to be able\nto share your results with others\ntableau is also you know ideal for that\nthey have great reporting tools\nit doesn't matter really what kind of\norganization you're in you you can pass\nyou know if you have tableau server or\nor not you can you can pass your\nworkbooks on to others so that they can\nview them as\nwell so what is tableau\nso we kind of covered it briefly in the\nlast slide but it's just a business\nintelligence slash data visualization\ntool that allows you to make sense of\nyour data\nreally by by looking at it\nright i mean\nsometimes we're we're looking at\nmillions of rows of data you could check\nmaybe the first hundred or\nyou know first few thousand and look at\nthe data but that's really not efficient\nand it's really not\nit's really not feasible these days to\nbe able to\njust look at the data and figure out\nwhat's going on with big data and\nthere's millions tens of millions of\nrows billions of rows potentially\nand being able to throw this stuff\nquickly into\na tool like tableau and look at it\nreally really helps a lot\nso here you have tableau desktop and\nthen the server version so that we're\ngoing to be using the desktop version\ntoday specifically\ntableau public which is free you can\ndownload it for free from their website\nand that's just the software that you\ndownload to your computer and then the\nserver version actually\nis within the browser you can create\ncharts and dashboards and then upload\nthat to the server for consumption\nthroughout your organization\nso\nthe interface here for tableau desktop\nis is really just drag and drop it\nreminds me of a pivot table in excel so\nyou drag you know the columns and rows\naround to get what you want\nand and the way that this works is these\nare the fields here\num and it's broken down into dimensions\nand measures so a dimension i think of a\ndimension as basically a category or a\ncategorical variable\nand then a measure is a numerical value\nso it could be the number of records it\ncould be any number of things\nand then here you have\na filter you can apply a filter here\nand i'll show you how to use this\nsection later the filter in the mark\nsection\nbut moving over here here's where you\nplaced your columns and rows\nso if i want to basically\nshow in column form i want to be able to\nlet's just say pull in current status\nhere\nto the columns and then number of\nrecords to the row then it would give me\nthe current status categories along the\nx-axis and then the volumes\nfor that category along the y-axis here\nso we're going to go over this\nwith the live demo here but just want to\ngive you a brief introduction to the\ninterface\nand and how it's set up\nand this is the end result you know once\nyou're able to make a few charts you\ncould pull it together and make a\ndashboard like this for example\nso now we're going to go ahead and\ndownload tableau public i've just\ngoogled tableau public here\nand you're gonna have to put in your\nyour email address here to\ndownload the app\ngo ahead and put mine in there\nand download it\nmay take a while\ndepending on your internet speed\nbut it's generally pretty quick\nso go ahead and install that on your\ncomputer\ni'm going to fast forward the video here\nso that\nyou don't have to watch this entire\ninstall but feel free to\npause the video and\nhit play again when you're\nready to go\nokay so now i've downloaded tableau\npublic\ni have\nthe shortcut here was installed on my\ndesktop\nand here we needed to connect to a file\nso it gives you several options here\nexcel text json access pdf spatial or\nstatistical file\nand the difference between the tableau\npublic version and the tableau desktop\nwhich is the paid version it's about 850\ndollars is that you're you're limited to\njust a handful of inputs here\nhand just a handful of file types um the\ndesktop version really has has more\noptions here and you can you know you\ncan connect to a server like\num\nazure or\nany sort of cloud environment so aws\nazure or google cloud and pull your data\nin directly from there here\nso we need to go ahead and get our data\nset and the data set i'm going to use\nfor this tutorial\nis the titanic data set from kaggle\nand i'll include links to tableau public\nand this data set\nin the\nvideo description you'll just click on\nthat\nand you'll probably have to\nsign up if you don't have a kaggle\naccount\nalready and basically what this is is\nkaggle is is essentially just\nsort of the online olympics for data\nnerds\nyou you have competitions for machine\nlearning deep learning models\ncompanies can actually\npost their\ntheir data sets on\nkaggle and have\nbasically the best data scientists in\nthe world compete\nto build the best model and the winner\ncan actually earn money so it's pretty\ncool\nso we're gonna go ahead and i've already\ngot an account so i'm gonna sign in here\nand once you're logged in you can go to\nthe data tab here and then we're gonna\nactually use train dot csv\nlet's go ahead and download that\ni'm just going to go ahead and move that\nto\nmy desktop\nand now we're going to connect to that\ncsv file so it looks like an excel file\nbut it's really a flat csv file\ntest one\nso we're going to use text file input\nhere navigate to the desktop pull that\nin\nand\nonce you open tableau public and import\nyour data set it's basically just going\nto show you\nall of the data fields that exist\nand you may not know what those what\nthose are so passenger id survived\npassenger class name example for example\nso kaggle actually has a data dictionary\nhere\non the data set page\nso survival is a categorical variable\none standing for yes two meaning know\nthat they didn't survive\npassenger class is the ticket class so\nfirst second third class\nsex is the gender male or female age in\nyears number of siblings\nparents children above the titanic for\nthe following variables and then ticket\npicket number\nfair cabin number so the cabin number\ncould be\nindicative of where they were located on\nthe ship\nand then embarked as their report of\nembarkation\nso just just looking at this data\ndictionary you can kind of get a feel\nfor\nwhich variables might be useful and\nwhich variables may not be useful at all\nso survival obviously is is very\nimportant we want to look at the\ncorrelation between these variables\nthese other variables and whether or not\nthe passenger survived\nso now we're going to go back to tableau\npassenger id that's going to be probably\nnot very useful survive that's going to\nbe very important\npassenger class\npassenger name is not going to be very\nimportant\nthe ticket number is unlikely to be\nsignificant\nfair that's how much they paid cabin\nnumber\nand embarked so you can see we have all\nthese columns here and you can always\nreference the data dictionary\nso we're going to go ahead and click on\nsheet 1 at the bottom\nand you can look how tableau\nautomatically pulls in these different\nvariables so they\nit makes a determination based on\nthe type of data being pulled in whether\nit should be a dimension or a measure\nso in this class i'm sorry in this\nexample we're going to\nreally just want to look at\nthe number of records\nand\nhow the number of records relate to\nthese different categories and whether\nthe passenger survives we're going to\nactually go ahead and make all of these\na dimension\nso for age to become a dimension\nwe may put that into different bins\nso if i want to do that automatically\nfor example if i want to choose an age\nlet me range ahead and give an example\nhere\nif i want to show this going down\nyou can see here that it's it's just a\nmeasure here so it's adding up all the\nages but what i really want to see is\nyou know is there sort of\na correlation between the age and\nwhether or not the person survives so we\nactually want to create a measure\nbased on this age measure\ncreate a dimension i'm sorry based on\nthis age measure\nand we can do that automatically by\ncreating bins so we can call it age bin\nand the size of the bin is basically the\nnumber of years between\neach bucket\nwe'll just do 10 years\nand if we pull that in there\nyou see we have a null value we'll go\nahead and\npull in the number of records and then\ncircle back to that null\nso here we go now we have a distribution\nof all passengers\non the\ntitanic we're going to go ahead and pull\nout the null here it's very important to\nnote that when i pull this over\ni'm not just clicking on it and pulling\nit over i'm hitting on a pc control on a\nmac you would use the command button and\nthen left click at the same time\nand pulling this field over to the\nfilters bar\nand if i uncheck the null value there\napply and then okay\nthat gives me the distribution without\nthe null values\nso this is great but\nyou know i want to have some context\nhere by adding percentages\nso if i take number of records here\nagain and pull it up to the rows bar\nand then\nhit this down arrow here and\nyou basically have this drop down and\nthen quick table calculation\nand then percent of total\nokay\nso now what that did is add we have the\nvolumes here above and then the percent\nof total below\nbut i really don't have any labels so i\nneed to add the labels here so this\nmakes sense\nin the marks bar\nthis basically allows you to change the\ncoloring the labels the size of your\nchart\nand you have three\nin this example you have three sections\nyou have\nall\nthe section which is the summation of\nall the records\nand then this bottom one represents the\nbasically the percent of total\nso for the second one we want to go\nahead and pull in the labels\nhere\nto add the labels the column labels to\neach each bar\nso i'm going to hit control on my pc\ncommand on a mac and then left click\nhold those together and then drag it\nover to the labels\nbox\nand you can see that it adds the labels\nthere\nwe're going to do the same thing now but\nfor the bottom section\nand the percent of total\ncontrol left click hold and then move it\ndown to the label section you can see\nnow on top we have the volumes and then\nthe percentage of the total number of\nrecords below\nso this is great but what it really\ndoesn't give us is whether\nyou know we want to know if age was an\ninfluencing\nvariable on whether or not the passenger\nsurvived so\nwe're going to use the survived variable\nhere and it's a measure\ntabloid treated that as a measure when\nit pulled it in\nto the data set but\nwe really want to treat that as a\ncategorical variable so we want to\nconvert it from a measure to a dimension\nand the way you do that is you hover\nover the\nthe variable\nand click down here and then convert to\ndimension\nso now that's a dimension it moves up to\nfrom measures up to the to the dimension\nsection\nand we want to color\nthese bars based on\nwhether the passenger survives or not\nso i'm going to hold down control\nand then left click on my pc command\nleft click on the mac\nin order to drag this field over\nbut i want to do i want to apply that\ncolor to both sections so i'm going to\nclick on the all marks box here and then\nclick on it\ncontrol left click hold and then\ndrag that over to color\nand then you can see this legend pops up\nover here on the right\nand what that represents is if it's\norange then\nthat represents a survivor\nthe survivor portion of the population\nand blue is the non-survivor population\nso you can see what the distribution\nlooks like here in terms of\nthe total number of records by age bin\nand then you can compare\nyou know each\nratio the percentage\neach age bucket to see if that age\ngrouping had a disproportionate survival\nrate relative to\nall the passengers\nso this is great we're going to call\nthis\ni'm going to rename this tab so i just\ndouble clicked here on the sheet and\nwe'll call it age\nokay\nand now the good part is that we've\nalready built this out so we don't have\nto redo this for every variable so i'm\ngoing to right click here\nand then duplicate\nand so what i'm going to do now is just\nswap out age for another variable\nso in this case we're going to use\npassenger class\nso i want to get rid of age bin\nso what i did to get rid of that is i\njust clicked on it left clicked no\ncontrol or command button just\nand then just\ndragged it below and that got\nyou know that removed it from the filter\nand i can do the same thing here just\ndrag it away\nand here we're just stuck with you know\nleft with\nthese\nthe summations of each\neach category here\nso now i want to add passenger class\nthis\nalso was treated as a measure so we want\nto convert that to a dimension\ndrag that over\nwe only have three classes here i can\ndrag\nthis over this chart to expand it\nso that it makes more sense\nwe do not have any null values here\nwhich is great\nand you can see that it automatically\npopulates\neverything so that's that's great we can\nchange the name here to\np class to represent passenger class\nduplicate that\nand\nappearance of children let's look at\nthat\nnumber of parents children aboard the\ntitanic\nnumber of sibling spouses aboard the\ntitanic\nwe're going to look at sibling spouses\nwe'll convert that to a dimension\nswap that\nout\nthere we go\nrename this sibling\nspouse\nand i'm going to create one more\nchart one more sheet\nand it's basically going to be whether\nor not they survive just to get a feel\nfor you know out of all the passengers\nhow many survived\nso i'm going to pull over the survived\nvariable here and then number of records\nand\nthis does not look very nice right so we\ncan actually change the chart type over\nhere if you click on\nshow me\nover here in the top right corner i'm\ngoing to actually just create a pie\nchart i feel like that\nmakes a lot of sense for\nthis\ntype of information\nyou know it's going to be one or the\nother they survived or they didn't\nsurvive and i can drag that out to make\na little bit bigger\nand when you click on the pie chart\noption here\nit automatically\nadds these labels and what i can do in\norder to add the labels to the\nvisual itself is control\nleft click\nand drag that up to the label\ncommand left click if you're on a mac\nand then\ni can add\nokay so that worked now i want to add\nsurvived\nthe one and the zero so one represents\na survivor zero represents a\nnon-survivor\nwe'll name that sheet survived\nokay so now we have four sheets we have\nage passenger class sibling spouse and\nsurvived\nand that's great we can actually use\nthis information to create a dashboard\nin tableau and i'm going to get that to\nthat in a second but what i want to\ncover\nvery quickly\nis how to create your own measure okay\nso i'm going to use age for this i'm\ngoing to instead of using the bins\ncreate a calculated field\nwe'll call it custom age\nbins\nwe're going to say if age\nis less than or equal to\n10\nthen\n0 to 10.\nelse\nif\nage\ngreater than 10.\nand age\nless than or equal to\nlet's just say 20\nthen 11 to 20.\nelse if\nyou get the idea i'm not going to do\nthis for every age bucket um\nwe'll just lump everybody else in\nover over 20.\num\nwe'll just put them in 20 plus so\nthey're 20 years plus\nand then if i add the end\nthere\ni've got lsif and an else so i'm going\nto go ahead and remove\nelsif and then i have an else which will\nbe the catch-all at the end if it\ndoesn't fall within one of these buckets\nand then the end of the statement\napply\nand now i'm going to duplicate the age\ntab\nfor this example and swap out age bin\nfor my custom age group\ncustom age bin\nso now you can see it's 0 through 10 11\nthrough 20 20 plus and\nyou know we can use the bin function to\ndo that really quickly i think the point\nof that exercise was to show you how to\ncreate a calculated field\nso i really don't need that anymore so\ni'm going to delete it\nso now we want to take these sheets\nthat we've created and we want to make a\ndashboard okay\nso to do that you can see these three\ntabs here\nbelow with the\nlittle chart there and then the four\nboxes and then what's called a story\nwe want to click on the\nthe dashboard by the new dashboard\nbutton\nokay so what this does is creates a\nblank canvas for us to create a\ndashboard and this thing always for\nwhatever reason the size is always\nwrong so i just change it click on this\nlittle down\narrow here and then the other one\nright below it and choose automatic and\nit expands it\nto fit your screen and then we just\ndouble click each of these sheets\nso age class sibling survived\nokay\nthat was really fast really easy\nto kind of pull this stuff together\nand add it to a dashboard\nand i don't like this number of records\nthing every i can click on it and check\nyou know hit the x and it will remove it\nand let's say i want to have survived up\nhere in the top section i can move\ni can move that around\nyou can drag and drop these\nsections\nto fit your needs\nthere we go\nlet's say i want to expand this some you\ncan actually just hover your mouse out a\nlittle ways\nand\ndrag that so that it stands out a little\nbit more\nand you can change the colors here\nso i can change the survived or\nnon-survived\ni'm going to change that to green to\nrecord you know\ni'm sorry change the one to green to\nrepresent that they survived and then\nthe zeroed to red\ni could do that here and it will change\nall of them\nthere you go\nsome nice christmas colors\nbut\nwe can drag this over as well\nto make it fit\nmore symmetrical and then\nincrease the size of this\nas well\nand reposition it\nso\nwe just in a matter of minutes we're\nable to create sheets\nand then a dashboard and yeah that's\nreally fantastic i don't\nall these other tools that you could use\nlike click or d3\nor i\ni don't know it takes a while it's it\nyou got to know how to code in those\nsoftware programs in order to make the\nvisualizations\nand it\nyou know it's just a pain so the thing i\nlike about tableau is it's it's really\neasy i compare it to to like an iphone\nwhere p someone a child can basically\npick up an iphone\nand immediately start using it it's that\nintuitive\nyou know tableau is that way for\nvisualization it's really that simple\nyou just literally drag and drop\nuntil you get what you want\nso i really actually don't like these\ncolors especially the red\nmaybe we'll just add\nthe blue back\nokay that's a little bit better\nbut anyway we only dealt with a few of\nthese variables here\nyou can get a feel for you know how many\npeople survived\nyou know it looks like and we we could\nactually add the percentages here as\nwell um\nbut it looks like\nyou know most people did not survive\nso it's really sad\num and you can look at\nat this chart here and say\nyou know out of the people that did\nsurvive it looks like you know if they\nwere between the ages of 20 and 30 you\nhad a better success rate there\nand for the passenger classes it looks\nlike if you were\nyou know in the first class you had a\nbetter shot\nyou know 15\npercent versus\nyou know less than 10 percent here and\nthen 13 here\nand siblings and spouses those that had\num i guess fewer siblings and spouses\nthey they survived at a higher rate\nwhich is\num\nobviously pretty sad\nbut\nthis this really kind of brings to life\nthe data\nwe we all know what happened with the\ntitanic\nand if we were to just look at this data\nhere in the data source\nyou know just looking at this\nyou know there's only 891 rows you might\nbe able to even look at this and sort of\npick up some trends but what if that\nnumber was 8 million rows right there's\nno way you could could go through that\ndata and honestly there's no way you\ncould get this data into excel\ni know they have excel's gotten better\nbut just the\nexpedience with which you can pull data\nin and look at it i i'm not sure that\nyou could do that with any other\nsoftware that's available\nand then quickly create these sheets and\ndashboards so\nand thanks for watching\n[Music]\n",
