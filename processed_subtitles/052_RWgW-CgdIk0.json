  "text": "hi there welcome to this brand new\nlearning video called cloud computing\ntutorial i'm samuel a multi-platform\ncloud architect and trainer working for\nsimply learn let's dive deep into the\ntopics we're going to discuss here why\nwe needed cloud computing to begin with\nand what is cloud computing and\ndifferent types of cloud computings\navailable at the moment and we also are\ngoing to talk about a dominant cloud\nproviders available in the market at the\nmoment and we will touch a few topics or\nscenarios on life cycle of a cloud\ncomputing solution and we will be\ntalking about how cloud computing is\nimplemented in aws and there is nothing\nlike visually seeing how things work in\nthe cloud right so we're going to end it\nwith a demo and we're going to talk\nabout products or we're actually going\nto use products like ec2 and s3 ec2\nbeing a virtual computer in the cloud\nand s3 being an object storage in the\ncloud let's understand about why cloud\ncomputing was needed what was the\nproblem that we had that cloud computing\nsolved and since then it took over the\nmarket let's understand that first and\nthat will solve a lot of unanswered\nquestions about cloud computing or\nservices that you might have here on the\nleft we have an owner of a business and\nhe wants to set up an dc or have an i.t\ninfrastructure for his company so he\ncalled paul an i.t educated person in\nhis company and consulted him about how\nto go about setting up an id\ninfrastructure now paul is the kind of\nguy who keeps himself updated about\nwhat's happening in the iit industry and\nhe frequently goes through learnings\nabout the reason technology so without\nmissing a beat paul suggested why not\nset up the environment in the cloud but\nhis manager was not sure about what is\ncloud and and more than trying to\nunderstand what cloud is he was curious\nabout the benefits of cloud over having\nand dc locally so paul started to\nexplain the very same thing i'm going to\nexplain to you now let's start with the\nexpenditure or the billing model with\ncloud the billing model is pay as you go\ntype meaning we use less and pay less\nand we use more and we pay less per unit\non the other hand in on premises we\ncan't expect that we pay everything\nupfront and there is an additional\noperating cost and it never lets us to\ndynamically scale in premises a lot of\nspace is required for seating the\nservers but in the cloud not such space\nrequirement is needed for the\norganization in on-premises we also need\na dedicated team to manage the hardware\nand software but in the cloud no such\ndedicated team is needed for most of the\nservices they all get managed by the\nprovider and even if we need to manage\nthem the provider gives us options to\nmanage them through the console which is\nlot lot simpler than managing directly\nfrom the device in the on premises we\nneed to admit the fact that data\nsecurity is poor due to the cost\ninvolved in procuring the hardware and\nsoftware to provide the security but in\nthe cloud the security standards are\nhigh due to the investments the\nproviders have done to secure the data\nand to meet the compliance in\ntraditional dc there will generally be\nless focus on data recovery and we kind\nof settle for less when it comes to data\nrecovery due to the cost involved and\nyou know the effort involved in\nreplicating the data and even if we set\nup a high performing data replication a\nlot more can be done in the cloud for\nthe same cost the on-premises\nenvironment lacks the flexibility needed\ntoday like if i need to restructure the\nit for the new age business needs then\nthe on-premises is not so friendly for\nsuch changes but in the cloud i can\neasily undo or tear down an environment\nor migrate to the new environment and\ntear down the old environment in few\nbutton clicks now looking at the number\nand the frequency of the releases that\nhappen scheduling updates would be an\nfull-time job but with cloud the updates\nhappen automatically in on-premises if\ni'm working with the team that is spread\nacross the globe working with them in\nunison and sharing the data is a tedious\nwork but with the cloud there are a lot\nof tools and technologies put together\nthat makes it easy to share the data\nwith other members in the team or with\nthe new prospective customer in on\npremises if i'm working with the team\nthat is spread across the globe working\nwith them in unison and sharing the data\nis a tedious work but with a cloud there\nare a lot of tools and technologies put\ntogether that makes it easy to share the\ndata with other members in the team or\nwith a new prospect customer i will be\nworking with who is present across the\nother side of the globe in on premises\nthe data will be present inside the dc\nor inside the on-premises dc and even a\nvalid user trying to access the data\nfrom outside the organization is a tough\ntask but with a cloud as long as someone\nhas internet providing the person access\nis just a few mouse clicks away talk\nabout implementation building an\non-premises dc takes time i was working\non a project few years back and the goal\nto make a dc go live at that time was\nafter two years from the date we were\nspeaking about it but with the cloud we\ncan bring our dc in the cloud within\nweeks after all this explanation and\ncomparisons and talking about benefits\npaul's manager was fully enlightened and\nwants to have his iet environment in the\ncloud but our paul is not done yet and\nhe took his manager through another\nlevel of discussion about the cloud just\nlike i'm going to take you now so let's\ntalk about what is cloud computing now\ncloud computing is the ability to\ndeliver on-demand computing service over\nthe internet and that too on a\npay-as-you-go basis now you might think\nwell what does that mean let me explain\nnow with cloud rather than managing\nfiles on local storage devices cloud\ncomputing makes it possible to save them\nover the internet and access them from\nthe internet so i can be a mobile person\nand i'm moving from place to place but i\ncan access the storage from the internet\nbecause it's in the internet and if i\nwant to give access to somebody else\nagain it's easy for me to give access to\nthem as long as they have internet\nconnection available with them now let's\nmove further and talk about or get\nunderstanding on the types of cloud\ncomputing we can categorize the\ndifferent types of cloud computing based\non two wide categories one being a\ndeployment model and the other one being\nservice model let's talk about the\ndeployment model first deployment model\nis categorized into three types first\none is public and then private and then\nhybrid cloud in other words public cloud\nprivate cloud and hybrid cloud it'll be\neasy for me to explain and also it'll be\neasy for you to understand if i walk you\nthrough this example consider the\ndifferent types of vehicles we use to\ncommute from one place to another for\nexample if i want to travel i can pick a\nbus which is accessible to anyone i get\nin and i pay for the seat that i occupy\nand i pay for the time that i will be\ntraveling in it and i'm done cost is\nvery less here a similar kind of thing\nhappens in the public cloud i pay only\nfor the resource that i use and i pay\nfor how long i use it if i use less i\npay less if i use more i pay more for\nthat month simple on the other hand\nprivate cloud is like buying your own\ncar and using it for commuting purpose\nhere i pay a huge amount upfront and it\nis all owned only by me i do not pay for\nit in an hourly fashion but completely\nand all up front the cost here is very\nhuge and thirdly if i want the best of\nboth types like the comfort of the own\ncar and still don't want to pay all\nupfront otherwise one only to pay for\nthe time that i use the service i can\nrent a car similarly i can have it in a\nhybrid environment meaning if i already\nhave a dc i can integrate it with the\ncloud and use both the dc's and that\nwould become an hybrid environment all\nright so that was good often\nlearning let's summarize the types of\ncloud based on deployment models and as\nwe know now about the public cloud\npublic cloud is an cloud infrastructure\nthat's made available to the general\npublic over the internet and it is owned\nby the cloud provider some of the major\nplayers as cloud providers are aws\nmicrosoft azure ibm's blue cloud and sun\ncloud and private cloud now this cloud\ninfrastructure is exclusively operated\nby a single organization it can be\nmanaged by organizations or third party\nand may exist on premises or\noff-premises doesn't matter but the\npoint here is this is exclusively\noperated for a single organization and\nsome companies that provide private\ncloud are aws and vmware and hybrid\ncloud gives the best of both public and\nthe private cloud for example the\nfederal agencies they opt for private\nclouds for storing and developing\npersonal data and they use public cloud\nto share the non-sensitive data with the\ngeneral public or with other government\ndepartments now let's talk about\ndifferent clouds based on the service\nmodel if we need to categorize them\nbroadly we can categorize them as\ninfrastructure as a service ias or\nplatform as a service paas or software\nas a service sas they sometimes are\nreferred to as i as pass and says now at\nthis moment you could be like this guy\nthinking sam i thought you're done\ncategorizing the cloud now you're going\nto talk about three more categories\nwhich one should i pick well let me\nexplain if all that you want is just in\nvm and you have all the expertise to\ninstall the software on top of it and\nmake it work then go for is if you only\nwant a platform or an interface to\nprogram or an interface to upload a\nprogram and make it run then pick pass\nor if all that you want is a finished\nproduct hosted in the cloud and be able\nto access it through the internet then\ngo for sas here you get a username and\npassword for an application and you can\nbegin to customize the application based\non your needs all right let's talk about\nis in a bit more detail is it gives\nbasic computing infra it's based on pay\nfor what you use model and some of the\ncloud providers who are big players are\naws azure and google and here the users\ngenerally will be id admins in pass the\nprovider gives you a platform or a\nruntime environment for developing\ntesting and managing application it's\nplatform ready you buy the platform you\nupload your code and you start working\non it and it allows the software\ndevelopers to deploy applications\nwithout running the underlying\ninfrastructure and as you might have\nguessed by now the interesting\ncandidates who would use paz is software\ndevelopers and in sas everything is\nmanaged by the vendor be it the hardware\nor the software it's managed by the\nvendor and we pay for the service and we\npay for it through a pay as you go\nsubscription model and as you might have\nguessed the end users here would be end\ncustomer itself all right let's put\ntogether everything in the same page and\ncompare and contrast the different types\nof service models in this chart it\nexplains the difference between the four\nmodels starting from on-premises to i as\nand then pass and says it is\nself-explanatory that the resources\nmanaged by us are huge in on-premises\nand little less in is and further less\nor reduced in pass and nothing to manage\nwhen it comes to sas let me also explain\nthe different types of cloud services\nthrough an example like this let's say\nthat you have a crush on cake and you're\nplanning to bake one yourself now let's\nlook at the options you can have you can\nmake all the ingredients yourself be the\nfloor butter and you know put together\nand bake the whole thing yourself using\nyour own oven pan you know the needed\nwater and the rest you get idea right\neverything is yours and that's on\npremises all that you use is owned by\nyou and nothing is managed by the vendor\nthe other options you can have is buy\nthe ingredients and\nmix and bake the cake yourself now this\nwould be like is here the infra is\nmanaged by the provider and we get to\nuse it and customize it the way we want\nit here the cloud service is in shared\nresponsibility the other options you\nstill have on hand is simply pick a\nphone and order a cake now this is a lot\nsimpler than the rest we discussed so\nfar you know it's simply picking the\nphone and ordering the cake and pay for\nit when it arrives simple and when it\nreaches home you will have to arrange\nthe table garnish the cake if that's\nneeded and then enjoy the cake it's the\nsame way with pass just get the platform\nin which you would run your code and\nupload your code and start running your\napplication here you and the vendor\nstill share the responsibility you still\nhave one more option left that is simply\ngo out and dine this is a lot lot\nsimpler that it requires no effort from\nus at all you buy the fully finished and\ngarnished cake and pay for it and walk\nout no responsibility on making the cake\nit's the same way with sas we buy the\nfinished product and pay for the\nfinished application as next thing let's\ntalk about the different cloud providers\namazon web services aws is a cloud\ncomputing service provided by amazon it\nprovides a mix of infrastructure as a\nservice is platform as a service pass\nand package software as a service called\nsas offerings microsoft azure formerly\nknown as windows assure is a cloud\ncomputing service by microsoft and it\nsort of specializes in using cloud for\nbuilding testing deploying and managing\nthe applications through the servers\nthroughout the global network that\nmicrosoft manages it also provides\nsoftware as a service platform as a\nservice infrastructure as a service and\nit supports lots of different\nprogramming languages and tools and\nframeworks including both microsoft and\nthird-party software and systems ibm\ncloud is a cloud computing service\noffered by ibm ibm cloud includes\ninfrastructure as a service software as\na service platform as a service now the\ndifference is here it offers through\npublic private and hybrid cloud delivery\nmodels vmware on the other hand is an\nsubsidiary of dell technologies and\nprovides cloud computing and platform\nvirtualization software and services it\nwas the first commercially successful\ncompany to virtualize the x86\narchitecture google cloud platform on\nthe other hand is offered by google it's\na suit of cloud computing services that\nrun on the same infrastructure that\ngoogle uses internally for its end user\nproducts such as the google search and\nthe youtube you're familiar with\nalongside a set of managed tools it also\nprovides cloud services including\ncomputing services data storage services\ndata analytics and machine learning\nservices digitalocean on the other hand\nis headquartered in new york city with\ndata centers worldwide digitalocean\nprovides developers cloud services that\nhelp to deploy and scale applications\nthat run simultaneously on multiple\ncomputers as of january 2018\ndigitalocean was the third largest\nhosting company in the world in terms of\nweb phasing computers let's talk about\ncloud computing in aws amazon web\nservices aws is an cloud computing\nservice provided by amazon and these\nservices are accessible over the\ninternet and because aws provides\ninfrastructure as a service it's a\nflagship offering we can create and\ndeploy any type of application in the\ncloud on top of the is that amazon\nprovides and you know the best part here\nis the subscriptions are pay as you go\ntype you use less and pay less and only\nfor what you have used you use more pay\nmore but still less per unit for the\nservice used attractive isn't it now\nlet's talk about the life cycle of the\ncloud computing solution the very first\nthing in the life cycle of a solution or\na cloud solution is to get a proper\nunderstanding of the requirement i\ndidn't say get the requirement but said\nget a proper understanding of the\nrequirement it is very vital because\nonly then we will be able to properly\npick the right service offered by the\nprovider getting a sound understanding\nthe next thing would be to define the\nhardware meaning choose the compute\nservers that will provide the right\nsupport where you can resize the compute\ncapacity in the cloud to run application\nprograms getting a sound understanding\nof the requirement helps in picking the\nright hardware one size does not fit all\nthere are different services and\nhardwares for different needs you might\nhave like ec2 if you're looking for is\nand lambda if you're looking for\nserverless computing and ecs that\nprovides containerized service so there\nare a lot of hardware's available pick\nthe right hardware that suits your\nrequirement the third thing is to define\nthe storage choose the appropriate\nstorage service where you can backup\nyour data and a separate storage service\nwhere you can archive your data locally\nwithin the cloud or from the internet\nand choose the appropriate storage there\nis one separately for backup called s3\nand there is one separately for archival\nthat's for glaciers so you know you\nknowing the difference between them\nreally helps in picking the right\nservice for the right kind of need\ndefine the network define the network\nthat securely delivers data video and\napplications define and identify the\nnetwork services properly for example\nvpc for network route 53 for dns and\ndirect connection for private p2p line\nfrom your office to the aws data center\nset up the right security services im\nfor authentication and authorization and\nkms for data encryption at rest so there\nare variety of security products\navailable we got to pick the right one\nthat suits our need and there are a\nvariety of deployment and automation and\nmonitoring tools that you can pick from\nfor example cloud watch is for\nmonitoring auto scaling is for being\nelastic and cloud formation is define\nthe management process and tools you can\nhave complete control of your cloud\nenvironment if you define the management\ntools which monitors your aws resources\nand are the custom applications running\non aws platform there are variety of\ndeployment automation and monitoring\ntools you can pick from like cloud watch\nfor monitoring auto scaling for\nautomation and the cloud formation for a\ndeployment so knowing them will help you\nin defining the life cycle of the cloud\ncomputing solution properly and\nsimilarly there are a lot of tools for\ntesting a process like code star and\ncode build and code pipeline these are\ntools with which you can build test and\ndeploy your code quickly and finally\nonce everything is set and done pick the\nanalytic service for analyzing and\nvisualizing the data using the analytics\nservices where we can start querying the\ndata instantly and get a result now if\nyou want to visually view the happenings\nin your environment you can pick antenna\nand other tools for analytics are emr\nand which is elastic mapreduce and cloud\nsearch all right enough of theory and\nlet's have a quick look at how two\nservices in aws ec2 and s3 work together\nand benefits us here are two id\nprofessionals talking to each other one\nsays i have an application which takes a\nlot of storage and works only on linux\nsystem which i do not have at the moment\nand the other one is a smart guy and he\nimmediately replies that he could use s3\nto store data and the tribe data and use\nec2 for all his compute needs and then\nthe curious conversation builds up and\nthe first person wants to know what is\neasy to ns3 and the second guy starts to\nexplain that aws ec2 is a web service\nthat provides a secure and resizable\ncompute capacity in the cloud and ec2 it\ncan also be used to launch as many\nvirtual servers as we need and about s3\nhe explains aws s3 is a simple storage\nservice provided by aws and about s3 he\nexplains further saying that using\namazon s3 we can store android drive any\namount of data at any time on the web\nall right so the very first thing is to\nhave an aws account so create an aws\naccount and second thing is to create an\naws s3 bucket and upload the files there\nyou know the files that ec2 server is\ngoing to pull from will get stored in s3\nas first thing all right so the first\nthing is to create an s3 bucket so let's\ncreate an s3 bucket and let's call it as\nwebsite bucket and these names will have\nto be unique so let's see if this bucket\nname is available says bucket name\nalready taken or already exist so let me\ntop it up with sl meaning simply learn\nalright so we were able to create a\nbucket and in that bucket let me upload\na content that basically is going to be\nmy index file that's going to go and sit\nin my web server so let me also make it\npublic and view it all right so this is\nthe content that i have stored in my s3\nand this is the content i'm going to\npush to my ec2 server right second step\ncreate an aws s3 bucket and upload files\nwe're done with that third is to create\nan ec2 instance that's in other words\ncreate an virtual machine in the cloud\nlet's go and create it all right the\nthird thing is to create an ec2 instance\nso let's create an ec2 instance it's\nplain and it's very simple i'm going to\nkeep everything as defaults here all\nright so i've launched an ec2 instance\nas you see it's running i also have an\nip address public ip address here with\nthat i have logged into this ec2\ninstance and i'm in the folder slash war\nslash www.html\nand as you see there is nothing in there\nat the moment and this server also has\napache installed in it as you can see\nyou know i browse to the ip address of\nthe ec2 instance and it's showing a page\nwhich is the default apache page all\nright if i had any files in this folder\nand that would get shown as the web page\ninsert off the default page our task is\nto save files in s3 and move them to the\nec2 instance so s3 is going to act as a\nstorage or a repository or a source code\ncontrol in this example all right so\nlet's do that all right the third step\nis to create your ec2 instance and\nthat's what we have done and the ec2\ninstance has no files in it and the\nfourth step is to synchronize the source\ncode bucket with the ec2 instance let's\ndo that the actual command to do that\nwould be aws s3 sync and then the name\nof the bucket from which we're going to\npull the code and the folder in which\nwe're going to put the code or the data\nall right so it has downloaded something\nlook at that and now if we go back to\nthe test page and do a refresh there you\ngo it's showing the page that it pulled\nfrom s3 so here i can use s3 as the\nsource code control bucket and\nany information that i put in there will\nget reflected in ec2 instance once i do\na sync every day and that's how i use s3\nas my storage for ec2 right finally we\nwere able to synchronize s3 bucket and\nthe ec2 instance and we were also able\nto view the results in the web browser\nof the ec2 instance the data was copied\nfrom s3 to the ec2 instance and that we\nwere able to view from the web browser\nall right so what did we learn we\nlearned about what is cloud computing\nunderstood the basics of cloud computing\nwe understood about the types of cloud\ncomputing based on deployment models and\nservice model and then we understood how\ncloud computing is with aws you know how\naws is a cloud computing service\nprovider and the benefits of using aws\nover other providers we also looked at\nlife cycle of the cloud computing\nsolution and finally we did a demo on\naws ec2 and s3 and we saw how ec2 is\ndependent on s3 or how we can use s3 to\nbe dependent on ec2 and sort of act as\nin storage for the computer instance i\nreally hope you enjoy this video i'll\nmeet you in the next video thank you\nhi there if you like this video\nsubscribe to the simply learn youtube\nchannel and click here to watch similar\nvideos turn it up and get
