  "text": "if you're looking to get your first\ncyber security certificate I know that\nit's a lot of research and work to try\nand make sense of all these different\ncertificates are available so don't\nworry this video I got you I have been\ndoing my research on what are the best\ncyber security related certificates to\ndo in when and who should take him\ndepending on where you are in your cyber\nsecurity Journey but before we do that I\ngot to quickly give a shout out to our\nsponsor corera for making this video\nhappen let me introduce you to the\nGoogle cyber security Prof professional\ncertificate on course era and not only\nit gives you the foundation that you\nneed but they also show you how to\nmanage security risks the basics of\nnetwork security as well as all the\nbasic tools that you need to succeed and\nit doesn't just stop at showing you\neverything you need to break into cyber\nsecurity they also help you with your\nresume interview prep and help plan your\ncareer with their job search and guess\nwhat it is 100% online and you can learn\nat your own pace and you can complete\nthis program in under 6 months if you\ndedicate only 7 hours a week so click\nthat link down below and get a 7-Day\ntrial try it out and let me know in the\ncomments what do you think but all right\nlet's jump into the video itself and\ntalk about these different security\ncertificates the first one we want to\ntalk about is the Cisco CCNA this is one\nof the most popular ones and I still get\nquestions about is CCNA still relevant\nto get and honestly I think it is very\nrelevant because of the fact that Cisco\nis wildly used and a lot of times I see\npeople that I've br broken into cyber\nsecurity by doing CCNA and honestly if\nyou don't want to do CCNA it's too much\nit's too expensive you do have the compa\noptions but also just want to keep that\nin mind that CCNA itself is really\nrelevant because of how big Cisco is in\nthe networking field what you can expect\nout of this certification is just the\nbasics of networking this isn't\nspecifically to break you into cyber\nsecurity but if you're coming from a\nbackground where you don't have any\nexperience in it and you don't have\nanything in cyber security and you want\nto break into getting a job in this\nfield then getting something your your\nCCNA or something similar to it is\nalways the first step to getting in\nthere not really relevant to cyber\nsecurity but I know a lot of folks have\ngotten this and then later moved on to\nthe next CT and having it on the resume\nhas been super helpful I just want to\nquickly talk about CCNA because I know\nthere's going to be a lot of questions\nabout it coming up but I also want to\ntalk about com's option because you have\nmore options you at have CompTIA\ncertificates like the A+ you have your\nnetwork plus Security Plus and pent Test\nPlus those are all the four that I know\na lot of people have gone after starting\nwith the A+ because A+ is going to give\nyou the basics of it so if you're coming\nfrom a background where you don't have\nany solid foundation of it maybe you\ndidn't go study a computers and you want\nto get a change in career then A+ is a\nreally good place to start and if we\nlook at their website really quickly\nright here you can see it is going to\nteach you things like operating systems\nsoftware troubleshooting it's going to\ngive you some understanding of security\nit's going to talk about virtualization\nand cloud computing mobile devices and\nobviously networking at a high level but\nthen you want to jump into your network\nplus your Network plus is going to be\nwhere you learn more of the foundations\nfor networking and it's going to help\nyou prepare for jobs like a junior\nnetwork administrator maybe a computer\ntechnician a network support specialist\na systems engineer again not cyber\nsecurity but the networking Community\nhas always been one of the strongest\ncommunities that's been helping people\nto break into cyber security itself\nthose are just the three that we talked\nabout the CCNA the A+ and network plus\nthey are not really a prerequisite but\nthey are a really good place to get\nstarted again if you're not coming from\na solid cybercity background or just\ngeneral it so keep those in mind not\nreally cyber security related but it is\ngoing to get you past HR especially if\nyou're just doing a change of careers\nnow let's talk about Security Plus\nSecurity Plus it is very very popular\nI'm actually going to bring up a\nLinkedIn search here in just a bit to\nsee how many of them are going to have\nSecurity Plus as a requirement but this\nis going to be what is going to get you\npast the HR in a number of different\nways and it is going to teach you things\nlike General Security Concepts threats\nand vulnerabilities how how to fix them\nsecurity architecture security\noperations and then obviously you're\ngoing to see things like security\nprogram management and oversight and it\nis also going to prepare you for cloud\npentesting jobs a junior pentester job\nnetwork security analyst we pentester\nand also security architect so there's a\nlot of big jobs you can see here but I\nwant to kind of prove how popular\nSecurity Plus is and now if we take a\nlook at these searches on LinkedIn you\ncan see the first job right here that is\na senior information security specialist\nso now let's look at another job right\nhere we're going to look at this senior\ncyber security and we going to look for\nCompTIA and you can see again all of\nthese different jobs that we're looking\nfor to have a requirement or desire for\nsomebody with Security Plus obviously\nyou're going to have your G and some of\nthese other ones like OSP and say SSP\nthat are also going to be in there but I\nkind of wanted to show how often it is\nthat you're going to see something like\nSecurity Plus being one of the security\ncertificates that is required or desired\nby people that are employing for these\npositions but so far we have talked\nabout the prequest quits like the\nnetwork plus A+ those are things that\nyou want to learn before we jump into\ncyber security we talked about Security\nPlus that is going to kind of show you\nthe basics of security but now I'm going\nto talk about the red versus blue sides\nof things if you want to be on the blue\nside of things when you're working on\nthe defensive side of cyber security you\nwant to take some sort of a certificate\nthat is going to focus more on the\ndefensive side so for example here we\nhave the cyber security analyst plus\nthis one is going to get you ready for a\nsecurity analyst role if R liability\nmanagement analyst maybe you want to be\non a stock team security engineer or\nthreat Hunter but you also have your\npentest plus which here is going to\nfocus mostly on the offensive side of\nthings this one is going to talk about\nplanning scoping out a pentest\ninformation gathering vulnerability\nscanning how do you attack and exploit\nhow to write a good report and\ncommunicate with your customer or your\nclients of course you're going to have\nyour tools in code analysis this one is\ngreat if you want to become a web pent\ntester a cloud pentester network\nsecurity operations but keep that in\nmind you are on the offensive side with\npentest Plus versus the other another\none with your cyber security analyst\nplus you are on the blue side which is\non the defensive side of cyber security\nso please keep that in mind if you're\nlooking to jump into cyber security you\ndon't know what you like you may want to\nplay some ctfs go on one of these\nplatforms and see if you are wanting to\ndo more on the defensive side versus\noffensive side which one is more\ninteresting to you before you start a\nbranch off and pick one of those to\nitself me personally I like to be on the\noffensive side this video is going to be\nmostly on the offensive side of things\nbut I want to make sure I make that\navailable to you so you do understand\nunderstand that you also have that\noption to be a Defender and not be on\nthe red team or on the attacking side of\nthings so keep that in mind but let's\nmove on and talk about your pentests\nthese are going to be probably the most\npopular ones on LinkedIn when you look\nfor jobs that are very focused on\nattacking and breaking into things\nstarting with CH and if you're watching\nthis and you're not a fan of CH I\nunderstand this certificate itself gets\na lot of flock online from a lot of\npeople because most of this content\nthat's available for CH you can learn on\nyour own you can go on webs Academy for\nexample or sign up for one of these CTF\nplatforms and learn them for free but\nhonestly CH is going to be a good place\nif you have no web application pen\ntesting background and if we look at the\ncourse outline online you can see right\nhere that it is going to teach you\neverything you need to know for ethical\nhacking for example from vul analysis to\nsystem hacking to sniffing social\nengineering dos hacking web servers SQL\ninjection iot hacking Cloud cryptography\nand so on and if we look up CH or\ncertified ethical hacker you're going to\nsee 7,000 or more jobs that are just\nspecifically looking for security folks\nwith a CH background so keep that in\nmind I know it gets a lot of crap\ngetting your CH and it is really really\nexpensive but it is one of those\ncertificates that it's going to be\ngetting you through HR and helping you\nwith your resume but it doesn't just\nstop there there are other certificates\nyou can do that are more reputable at\nleast from the hacker side of things\nstarting with OSP which is your\noffensive security certified\nprofessional ocp or anything by\noffensive security is probably one of\nthe most most respected certificates out\nthere and you can see right here on\ntheir syllabus directly from their\nwebsite they're going to teach you a lot\nof different things in starting with\ngetting you into a Cali VM setting it up\nand then all the way down to security\nstrategies looking for methodologies\ncase studies tactics the test for this\nit is absolutely hard I think you have\n24 hours to break into a bunch of\ndifferent machines and write a report it\nis probably one of the most stressful\nand hardest certificates to get through\nbut honestly if we go back to our\nLinkedIn search and look up ocp there is\ngoing to be a lot of different jobs for\nexample this pentest job with blue of\nCalifornia that is also going to require\nyour OSP I think if you have something\nlike a network plus A+ or you've even\ndone your pentest plus and you want to\ngo a step further OSP is definitely way\nto go I just understand that this is\nvery expensive there are also cheaper\noptions that you can get for example TCM\nSEC has a great option for the pnppt I\nthink is what they call it there's an\nalternative route to go whether you do\nyour ostp or PNP that all just comes\ndown to which one is going to get you\nhas HR but honestly OSP has probably\nbeen one of the most successful ones and\nI know a lot of folks that go and get\ntheir ocp as just a strategy to break\ninto cyber security and get a job on an\noffensive security team I think it's a\nreally good stopping point for us I\ndidn't even get to talk about Sands or G\ncerts if you want to hear more about\nthose certificates drop me a comment I'd\nlove to cover them but I don't want to\nmake this too long I just want to\nquickly make a video and answer a lot of\nthe questions around certificates where\nshould I start what should I get in\nshort if you're looking to break into\ncyber security do an A+ and network plus\ntogether will get you the basics of it\nand also make you understand networking\nif you don't want to do compa you also\nhave the CCNA on the other hand if you\nalready understand it and you know cyber\nsecurity at the basic levels you\nunderstand security and you want to get\na job with a blue teamer for example do\nsomething like your cisa Plus or you can\njump into the offensive side with a pent\ntest plus if you've already done those\nand you're ready to go to the next level\nI would personally recommend just\nskipping CH but I do understand there's\nvery very possible so if you have the\nmoney or a scholarship get your CH or\njust jump over through ocp get ocp and\nstart applying for jobs and honestly the\nother best thing that you can always do\nis go through Linkedin look at all these\ndifferent job listings see what are the\nrequirements to get these jobs how many\nof these certificates or the ones that I\nhaven't covered show up in each of these\ndifferent jobs and just go after them\nand learn them on your own all right\nthat's it I know that was a lot of\ninformation thrown at you I hope this\ngives you an idea for the best cyber\nsecurity certificates for beginners\nespecially if you don't have a\nbackground with it and if it does do me\na favor hit that like button subscribe\nto the channel I will see you all in the\nnext video\n[Music]\npeace\n",
