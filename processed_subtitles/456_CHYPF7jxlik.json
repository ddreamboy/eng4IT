  "text": "hi guys my name is vardan and on behalf\nof Ed Raa I welcome you all to this\nwebinar on dataware housing so I'll be\nyour instructor for today and in today's\nsession I'm going to talk about the data\nwarehousing Concepts okay the various\nconcept that are related to data\nwarehousing like olap schemas dimensions\nand facts all these things right all the\nimportant topics I'll be covering all\nthese things in today's session all\nright guys so without wasting much time\nlet me just go to the agenda slide so\nguys this is the agenda slide and uh\nthese are the topics that I'll be\ncovering in today's session okay and\nthis will be the order in which I'll be\ncovering them for those of you who are\nnew to data warehousing I will give you\na quick brief about data warehousing and\nI'll talk about what data warehouse is\nI'll talk about the data warehousing\narchitecture in detail and then I'll\nimmediately go to the different concepts\ninvolved so the important Concepts that\nare there are what olap is so olap\nstands for online analytical processing\nand I'll talk about olap in detail and\nthen I'll talk about the various olap\ncubes that we will usually work on right\nso any company or any working on a r\nWarehouse the different olap cubes that\nthey work on so I'll talk about these\nthings and after that I'll talk about\nDimensions facts and measures so these\nthree uh topics are interrelated so I'll\ntalk about them in one segment and the\nfinal segment of today's session is\ngoing to be about schemas all right so\nthese will be the three or four\ndifferent topics that I'll be covering\nin today's session so uh guys any doubts\nhere are you guys fine with the agenda\nand uh and I hope everyone can hear my\nvoice and see my screen so guys if\nthat's the case please put to your\nacknowledgements in the chat box and if\nyou have any doubts during the session\nplease put them also in the chat box and\nI'll get back to you at the earliest all\nright so can I get a quick yes from\neveryone all right great so have a\ncouple of yeses from here all right\nAnita is saying yes no is saying yes all\nright great and abbar is saying yes all\nright guys so let's get started then\nfirst of all what is data warehousing\nokay let's understand what are data\nwarehouses what data Ware housing does\nand why it's SE it and what are the\nadded benefits right so what is a data\nwarehouse a data warehouse is like a\nrelational database designed for\nanalytical needs so you guys might all\nbe aware of what a databas is right so\nyou have your database where you'll be\nstoring large amounts of data right\nyou'll be storing either in your\ndatabase or even in the form of flat\nfiles okay but flat files like Excel or\nsomething cannot be used for storing\nlarge amounts of data there's a limit on\nhow much you can store in an Excel right\nso that is the case where you store data\nand some of database so example of a few\ndatabases are those of Oracle MySQL\nMicrosoft SQL Server all these things so\nyou have all these databases you'll\nstore large amounts of data okay but the\nproblem is they cannot be used for\nanalytical purposes so that is why we\nhave to convert or uh you know get the\ndata inside a database get that inside a\ndata warehouse and when it's inside the\ndata warehouse then we can perform\nanalysis now that's the advantage so the\ndata that once has come into the data\nwarehouse can can be used for analysis\nfor visualization all these things\nbecause you can look at the data from a\ndifferent angle because the data that\ncomes into the data warehouse is more of\nan information rather than just data\nright so what you have here is just data\nwhich you can probably View and you can\nwrite data into these places and you can\njust view it from a high level okay you\ncan view it from the level of every\ntransaction that happens so every time a\nsale happens then the entire table there\nor the entire database will get updated\nokay all that will happen but then when\nyou want to perform analysis like what\nhappened on this day and how many\nproducts were sold during this period of\ntime all these things cannot be gained\nfrom a database right so that's why we\nneed to put them all insert data\nwarehouse and once it's here we can\nperform these kind of analysis and uh\nyou know get insights from the data\nwarehouse and of course since you're a\ndata warehouse your all your end users\nyour business analysts your data analyst\nthey can all use it for analysis and\nvisualization right so that's the thing\nabout a data warehouse and that's the\nuse of a data warehouse and functions on\nthe basis of olap right so I told you\nolap stands for online analytical\nprocessing so the whole process of doing\nanalysis or running queries on a data\nwarehouse right it's done on the basis\nof online analytical processing right so\nthat's one of the activities that is\ndone so if you're running any kind of\nqueries on the database then it will be\ncalled as oltp online transaction\nprocessing but any kind of activity or\nquering and all these things when it\nhappens on data warehouse It's called\nolap so that's what an no app is guys\nand yeah basically it's a center\nlocation where Consolidated data from\nmultiple locations are stored so you get\ndata in here from multiple uh locations\nfrom multiple sources you can get it\nfrom uh you know one or two databases\nyou can get it from one or two flat\nfiles you can get all these data as long\nas you know you are putting it inside\nthe same table or inside the same uh\ncolumns and dimensions then you'll be\nfine because you can get any amounts of\ndata from any source and you can get\nthem all and store them all inside your\ndata warehouse\nso is that all about data warehouse is\nData Warehouse so simple can we just uh\nsimply get the data in from a database\nand get it into a data warehouse and\nthen perform analysis is such a thing so\nsimple is that can be the question on\nyour mind okay does anyone here has that\nkind of a doubt if you guys have that\ndoubt please raise your hands guys\nthere's an option on the right side of\nyour panel there's an option to raise\nyour hands so I mean you're supposed to\nget that kind of a doubt and uh it's a\nvery valid question right because it\nlooks so simple from the outside but is\nit that\nsimple Yes okay I see a couple of hands\nraised from abbar and I see a hand\nraised by Anita all right so yeah that's\nthe thing okay it's not that simple now\nlet's see what are the other activities\nthat are involved in this whole process\nof converting data inside the database\nconverting it into an information and uh\nstoring that into Data Warehouse and\nthen performing analysis right so these\nare the entire set of activities that\nare involved okay now you can also\nconsider this to be the data warehouse\narchitecture now before I explain all\nthe activities and all the different\nstages that are there in this data\nwarehousing architecture let me first of\nall go to the definition okay so this\nwhole Act is called as data warehousing\nall right and data warehousing is the\nact of organizing and storing data in a\nway so as to make its retrieval\nefficient and insightful okay so this is\nthe uh key terms here to make its\nretrieval efficient and insightful so\nyou organize the data and you store the\ndata in a data Warehouse in a way you\ncan access the data at a later point of\ntime and uh that kind of an access\nshould be easy you should be in an\nefficient way you should be able to uh\nretrieve that data and there should be a\nmeaning out of that data it should not\nbe the same data that you store inside\nyour database okay so inside a database\nis the data that you collect so you\ncollect data and you store it inside a\ndatabase okay but the data that you get\nfrom a data warehouse should not be the\nsame so it should serve some purpose it\nshould have a meaning and it should be\nfor your benefit so that's the whole\npoint of for data warehouse so that's\nthe difference between a data warehouse\nand a database all right and uh a data\nwarehousing is also called as a process\nof transforming data into information\nokay so relevant data or more processed\ndata that is also called as information\nso that's what is stored inside a data\nwarehouse and uh there's a lot of\ndifference between the data stored in a\ndata warehouse and the data that is\nstored inside a database all right so\nthat is the thing now uh speaking about\nthe architecture and uh I mean let me\nexplain the diagram here first of all so\nyou have your data inside your different\ndata sources right uh it can be database\nor a flat file and that data should\nfirst of all be transferred into the\ndata warehouse but how was it done\nthere's an intermediate stage here\nthat's called the staging area Okay the\nplace where the data is stored that is\ncalled the staging database okay now\nthis is a temporary storage it's not\ngoing to be there for long it's very\ntemporary storage and the act of getting\nthe data from here to your staging area\nis done through the process of ETL okay\nso ETL here stands for extract transform\nand load okay and once it comes into the\nuh temporary storage again the process\nof ETL is used to transfer the data\ninside the data warehouse all right so\nso once the data is inside your data\nwarehouse it's not just your data that's\ngoing to be here okay it's going to be\ncategorized and it's going to be divided\nso you can think of these three things\nmainly so you'll have your raw data you\nwill have your meta data and you will\nhave your aggregate data okay so first\nof all your raw data is the rows or\ncolumns or the actual data that's being\ntransferred okay so this makes up the\njunk of the data okay but meta data is\nthe most important aspect which Powers a\ndata warehouse and which differentiates\nbetween a database and a data warehouse\nwhy because metadata is something that's\ngoing to give you data about your raw\ndata so whatever rowes that are there in\nyour data warehouse or whatever\ninformation that is there inside your\ndata warehouse right so information\nabout that particular data will be\nstored inside your metadata so we'll\nhave data about which are the different\ntables that are there in your data\nwarehouse what each table does and what\nkind of attributes are there inside each\ntable what kind of information what will\nbe the data type of the data present in\neach of those attributes so all these\nthings will be controlled and governed\nby metadata right so without your\nmetadata your data Val is basically\nuseless and metadata is the uh you know\nso anyone who's working on a data\nwarehouse right they will tell you that\nmetadata is what differentiates\neverything that's what makes their life\nsimpler and that's what is actually the\ndifference between a database and a data\nwarehouse right so this serves the whole\npurpose and the whole difference between\nthe two so that and then you have\naggregate data right so all these three\nthings together they form the data\nwarehouse and then once your data is\ninside your data warehouse your end\nusers can use this data to perform\nanalysis so how do they do it they run\nqueries okay so you have user groups\nhere and they perform queries okay now\nthe act of Performing queries on your\ndata warehouse is called online analy IC\nprocessing okay that's the olap okay so\nsuch queries are called olap queries\nbecause they will be analysis based\nright so such queries will be analysis\nbased so that's why it's called online\nanalytical processing and you have\nsomething called as data march here okay\nnow don't get confused because data\nMarch is again not something entirely\ndifferent it's again a part of data\nwarehouse only so the end users here\nthey can run their queries either\ndirectly on the data warehouse or on\nseparate data Mars now you have\nsomething separately called as data Mars\nover here because maybe you want to give\nextra sec Security in your Data\nWarehouse Systems right so you can see\nhere there is user group one there is\nuser group two and there is user group\nthree okay and each of these people they\ndon't get access to everything and the\nwhole point of even having a data Mart\nis uh simply to give restricted access\nto your data warehouse so your\norganizations or your company's entire\ndata right whatever is there that will\nall be stored inside your data warehouse\nokay but what if you don't want people\nto get access to everything and if you\nwant to just give them restricted access\nand give them access to only certain t\nand certain records so at that point of\ntime you can use a data Mart so a data\nMart again you know uh it's just called\na small version of a data warehouse\nwhere it will have data about a\nparticular domain so supposing the user\ngroup one that we're talking about here\nis something it's a sales team right\nthen you can have a sales data Mt and\nthe sales data M will only have the\nsales data from the data warehouse right\nand then uh supposing this is the\noperations uh Team right and they want\naccess to the operations data only so\nthen you can form a separate data Mart\nfor the operation stream called the\npurchase Mart or something and then\nbased on that they'll get access only to\nthe data that is present inside this Mt\nokay so even even though the all these\nthings will be present inside the data\nwarehouse so you will get access only to\nthis particular table or this particular\ndomain or this particular field so\nthat's what the difference is so data\nMar is just basically dividing your old\ndata warehouse into smaller parts so\nthat different sets of users or groups\nget access to only the relevant\ninformation that they want okay so\nthat's what data warehousing is and\nthese are the various activities that\nare involved in data warehousing okay so\nthis is the diagram of the data\nwarehouse architecture and I hope nobody\nhere has any doubt if you guys do have\nany doubt please shoot them right away\nand I'll ask them because next up is the\nvarious data warehousing Concepts okay\nnow if you want to understand data\nwarehousing Concepts uh uh in detail\nthen you have to have complete\nunderstanding of this I mean of course\nit's simple so I don't expect you people\nto have any doubts but yeah if you do\nhave any doubts please put them in the\nchat box and I'll get back to you all\nright so moving on the data warehousing\nConcepts now let's understand the\nvarious uh Concepts revolving around\ndata warehousing like olap Dimensions\nfacts and\nschemas so first of all let me give you\na brief about olap again let's go into\ndetails here as it says olap is a\nflexible way for you to make complicated\nanalysis of multi-dimensional data okay\nso when we say multi dimensional data\nthen whatever data stored in your data\nwarehouse it has multiple views right so\nthey will all be stored in such a way\nthat you can perform analysis they'll be\nstored all the different tables will be\nlinked with each other right so there'll\nbe different views there'll be different\ncategories of data and all these things\nyou know to perform analysis then you\nuse the olap activities right so the\nolap queries you run on that data and uh\nwhatever data stor in your data\nwarehouse that's called\nmulti-dimensional data and the Very Act\nof uh you know storing it is uh in the\nform of olap cubes right so you have old\nTP on one side and you have olap on the\nother side so as you can see this line\nit says old TP systems use data stored\nin the form of two dimensional tables\nokay an example of this would be any\nExcel so you will have your rows and you\nwill have your columns here okay you'll\nhave your rows and columns and you'll\nhave your data stored over here so this\nis your olp systems and any queries you\ncan run on them and you can do all these\nthings okay but the difference with the\nolap is the be stored in the form of\nolap cubes right so there'll be multiple\nDimensions there'll be multiple uh views\nthat you can get of the same data with\nrespect to the year with respect to the\nnumber of sales with respect to the\ndifferent products all these things you\ncan get a single view of all these\nthings so as you can see this diagram is\nmore of a 3D view right so that's what\nolap here stands for so we call it olap\ncubes and uh whatever data that is\nstored inside your data warehouse and uh\nwhichever data you access with the help\nof olap activities then that data is\ncalled as multi-dimensional data so\nthat's what the whole line here is all\nabout right so your data basically is\nconverted into a multi-dimensional form\nand uh that particular data to access\nthat data you use olap queries and yeah\nit'll be stored in such olap cubes right\nso these are the three different things\nand uh the next point it says data a\nhousing is modeled on the concept of\nolap yeah this is again this is what I\ntold you right so what our data is\nstored in of data warehouse is uh\nbasically stored in a multi-dimensional\nform and it's stored in the form of\ncubes and uh to run your queries on your\ncubes you run olap queries right so\nthat's why the entire process called\nolap cubes and uh processing\nmultidimensional data on your olap cubes\nright now that's what your data\nwarehouse is but with your database\ndatabase however are modeled on the\nconcept of olp right online transaction\nprocessing so your databases are modeled\non the concept of olp and your Warehouse\nis modeled on the concept of\noap all right so that's the key\ndifference between the two the PES on\nwhich these two are modeled and your olp\nsystems use data stor in the form of two\ndimensional tables with rows and columns\nand your olap will have multiple views\nright so your olap cubes and cuboids so\nthe olap is stored in that kind of a\nstructure but whereas your oltp here you\njust have your xaxis or Y axis or your\ntwo- dimensional data right so that's\nthe uh thing about olp and yeah that's\nthe difference between the two and uh\nwell the advantages of olap over oldp\nare first of all that when you can see\ndata from multiple uh angles right from\ndifferent angles from different views\nfrom different dimensions then you'll\nget new ideas right so you'll get new\ninsights you can think of different\nthings and your whole job of making\nanalysis and getting insights will\nbecome simpler it'll become easier with\nthe help of olap activities right\nbecause it supports activities like\nfiltering and sorting of data so maybe\nfiltering and sorting of data may be\npossible even inside o TP okay but\nthere's a limit on that so if when you\nhave data Sor in multiple tables then\nyou cannot do filtering and sorting of\ndata right now that is the advantage\nwith a data warehouse so even if you\nhave data stored in multiple tables you\nmight have four different tables or five\ndifferent tables and you'll have like\nthousands and millions of rows and uh\nyou know transaction that will be stored\nin those tables okay in spite of all\nthese things you can perform filtering\nand sorting operations or any\nmathematical operations like calculating\nall these things okay you can do all\nthese things and get the output inside\none single new table so that is the\ndifference between olap and olp right\nall such activities uh cannot be\nsupported on oltp and yeah so it finally\nsays that you know data can be refined\nso when you can perform such kind of\nanalysis when uh you know your data\nlooks much simpler for you to read right\nwhen you can gain some information out\nof your raw data then we call it refin\ndata so that's the other advantage of\nolap you know that's the other advantage\nthat olap has our olp so that's the\nthing about online analytical processing\nright so now uh I've spoken about these\nthings now let's go to the next slide so\nfirst of all in olap itself there are\nthree different types of Cubes okay so\nthe first one is molap rolap and holap\nokay so you know we also call it m oap\nmap or Moab so this stands for\nmulti-dimensional online analytical\nprocessing rap stands for relational\nonline analytical processing and whole\napp stands for hybrid online analytical\nprocessing all right so guys the whole\ntopic here is olap cubes right so your\nolap cubes is where your data will be\nstored okay now the analysis that you'll\ndo the kind of queries that you'll run\nthey will all be olab queries and they\nwill all be on the multi-dimensional\ndata okay so the data that's going to be\nstored inside your cubes is going to be\nmulti-dimensional data okay but your\nmulti-dimensional data where are they\ngoing to get stored okay so that is the\nwhole topic here so there are three\ndifferent types of places where you can\nstore your multi-dimensional data okay\nso there are three different types of\nolap cubes so the first type is\nmulti-dimensional olap Cube okay when we\nsay multidimensional olap Cube then this\nis the default type of olap Cube so here\nmolap is a form of olap that processes\nand sores data directly into a\nmulti-dimensional database so you have a\nmulti-dimensional cube and then your\ndata will be stored inside that\nparticular database now the advantage\nhere is that it will give you excellent\nperformance and it can perform complex\ncalculations okay but the problem is\nonly limited amount of data can be\nhandled in your molap okay but then\nthere's a difference between molap and\nolap okay now that's where rap scores\nover molap so rap stands for relational\nonline analytical processing now rap is\na form of olap that performs Dynamic\nmulti-dimensional analysis of data\nstored in a relational database rather\nthan in a multi dimensional database now\nwhat this means is that in your moap you\nhave your multi-dimensional data you'll\nbe storing it inside a multi-dimensional\ndatabase right so this will be your olap\ncubes okay so what that means is you\nhave your data that'll be stored inside\na multi-dimensional database okay thus\nmaking it a multi-dimensional data and\nuh that is one type of olap that is uh\nmulti-dimensional olap but relational\nolap is getting that multi-dimensional\ndata converting it into a relational\ndata and then storing it inside a\nrelational database right so that's what\nit says here it's a process of storing\ndata in a relational database so in your\nR app you will have your\nmulti-dimensional data stored inside\nyour relational database and then you\nwill be running multi-dimensional\nanalysis and multi-dimensional queries\non a relational database so that is the\ndifference right so your queries that\nyou'll be running your data is basically\ngoing to be multi-dimensional all right\neven your queries that you'll be running\nwill be the same it will be olap queries\nokay but the difference is the place\nwhere it's stored the data in case of a\nrap is stored in a relational database\nokay but whereas in case of a\nmulti-dimensional olap it is stored\ninside a multi-dimensional database\nitself now that is the difference\nbetween the two and speaking of the\nadvantage and why rap can be used\ninstead of molap is because a greater\namount of data can be processed in this\ncase all right but in case of map only\nlimited amount of data can be handled at\nany point of time but however the\nproblem is it requires more processing\ntime and a lot of disk space now it\nneeds more processing time because you\nare going to convert your\nmulti-dimensional data into a relational\ndata and once you've converted that you\nhave to then store it inside a\nrelational database now this is\ncertainly more time consuming than your\nuh multi-dimensional olap right so that\nis one disadvantage with your relational\nolap and also your amount of dis space\nthat will be occupied because of all\nthese processes is going to be greater\nnow that's the disadvantage but of\ncourse that comes with the benefit right\nso you're getting something out of using\nthis so that's the difference between\nmulti-dimensional olap and relational\nolap and then these are the two basic\ndifferences and then you have a third\none that's called as a hybrid olap right\nso your hybrid olap is basically\ncombination of both your molap and your\nrap so the positives and your advantages\nof four is used in your hybrid olap so\nthe advantage with whole app is that\nwhole app can drill through from the\ncube into the underlying relational data\nright so what it means is you will have\nyour Cube here and you have the\nunderlying relational data right so\nusing whole app you can drill through\ninto the relational data using your Cube\nso that's the thing about whole app\nwhich makes use of the best features of\nboth your multi-dimensional olap and\nyour relational olap right so these are\nthe three different types of olap cubes\nso this is again one important question\nthat you'll be asked in any job\ninterviews right so if you guys are you\nknow appearing for any job interviews\nthen you have to know the difference\nbetween these three cubes because you\nyour work will primarily be revolving\naround these three aspects so so guys uh\nin the audience do we have anyone that\nuh is going to appear for an interview\nvery soon Akbar n Anita any any of you\nokay Akbar says he's going to attend one\nvery soon all right so you're you're\nstill learning abar okay great so he's\nstill learning data housing and probably\nwhen he's done he might go for it an\ninterview and the thing that you need to\nremember rbar is uh the difference\nbetween these three because this is a\nshort short question in any of your\ninterviews right so any job interview\nregarding data warehousing and all these\nthings you will be asked and you should\nknow all these things right so that's\nthe uh differences and the types of olap\ncubes so moving on to the next slide so\nthe next topic that we have for today is\nthat of olap operations all right so we\nhave five different operations and they\nare roll up drill down slice Dice and\npivot okay so these are the five\ndifferent olap operations that we can do\non our olap multi-dimensional data right\nso going to our first operation that is\nrollup now before I uh explain this let\nme tell you why I'm explaining\noperations first of all so I'm\nexplaining olap operations so that you\ncan understand what are the kind of\noperations that you can do on your data\nwarehousing and things that you cannot\ndo on your database right so so with the\nhelp of olap and since data is stored in\nsuch a multi-dimensional fashion these\nkind of operations can be performed\nright so first of all let's get started\nwith our rollup operation so uh let's uh\nread the definition first so rollup is\nsomething that forms aggregation or data\nCube by either climbing up a concept\nhierarchy for a dimension or for\nDimension reduction okay so when we say\nclimbing up a concept hierarchy for a\ndimension it basically means you'll have\na particular Dimension here right so in\nuh this case we have the dimension of\ncities so we have four different cities\nwe have Chicago New York Toronto and\nVancouver okay now supposing you want to\ngo to the next hierarchy in this\nDimension okay you want to add a couple\nof attributes here and more to the next\ndimension of countries then you can do\nthat so if you look at this example here\nwe have converted this Dimension which\nis in the form of cities to countries so\nUSA is a country which has Chicago and\nNew York As Cities and Canada is a\ncountry which has Toronto and Vancouver\nAs Cities so we have converted this\nDimension into the city dimension of\nthat is present this Cube into country\nDimension right so this is the kind of\noperation that we've done so we've done\nthat using a rollup operation right so\nthat's uh the thing and uh let me first\nexplain this concept here this example\nso first of all we have this Cube here\nand we have different axis right we have\nx axis we have y axis and we have Zed\naxis so these are x axis where we have\nstored the different items right so the\ndifferent types of products that are\nthere for salees so we have mobiles\nmodems phone and security right so this\nthis is the four different items that\nare there for uh sale and then we have\nthe time time at which the sales were\ndone like different quarters of a year\nquarter one quarter 2 quarter three and\nquarter 4 right and then we have the\ndifferent cities Chicago New York\nToronto and Vancouver so this is the Z\naxis y axis and this is the x-axis now\nwhen we say we are doing a rollup your\nrollup operation we are basically\nconverting this Dimension into a\ndifferent dimension with the different\nset of attributes right we're changing\nthis whole dimension so in this\nDimension right now we have these two\ncities part from USA and these two\ncities from Canada so we are doing a\nrollup such that we are doing a rollup\non location and converting the cities\ninto countries so if you look at this\nhere we are aggregating these two\nattributes right so these two different\nattributes together and these attributes\ntogether so when you do the rollup and\nwhen you convert this Dimension then\nwhat you get is for USA you have the\ntotal number of sales as 2,000 okay\nbecause it is the aggregate of New York\nand Chicago 440 + 15 60 but whereas\nCanada it's 395 because only Toronto\nadds to this and there is nil from\nVancouver all right so that's what we\nsay when we are doing a rollup so we are\ndoing a rollup on the items based on any\nparticular Dimension right so this\nDimension we aggregated uh a part of\nthis Dimension and we converted this\nDimension from cities to Country so this\nis the kind of operations that you can\ndo on the set of attributes that will be\npresent inside your Dimensions so uh\nthat's about the rollup okay now the\nnext uh operation that I want to talk\nabout is that of drill down now drill\ndown is something that is just the\nreverse of rollup so what we did in\nrollup was we aggregated set of\nattributes right so let's break down the\nentire attribute into smaller attributes\nall right so uh we can do that by this\nstepping down a concept hierarchy for a\ndimension okay and by also introducing a\nnew dimension so if you look at this\nexample uh it's a similar Cube where we\nhave similar details where we have\ndetails for the quarter one we have the\nfour different details and uh basically\nthe dimensions are the same right so we\nhave the items or types for sale we have\nthe different time and the different\ncities okay but when you look at this\ndiagram what we've done is when you say\ndrill down we've done a drill down\noperation on the time so the uh time\nhere right the time di menion we have\nrepresented each of them by quarters so\nquarter one quarter two quarter three\nand quarter 4 but the thing is each\nquarter can be further broken down into\ndifferent months so in quarter one\nyou'll have January February and March\nright so what we've done with the help\nof our drill down operation is we've\nbroken down this quarter one into the\ndifferent months respectively so if you\nlook at this one here if you look at the\nsecurity that has been sold 400 in\nquarter 1 then if you look at that then\nthat's been divided into three different\nmonths right so in January February and\nMarch and how many products have been\nsold in each of those three different\nmonths so this is the kind of example\nright so we've done a drill down on the\ntime so here it was in the form of a\nquarter and we've drilled down this\nwhole whole particular attribute into\nthree different attributes three further\nattributes right into months and\nsimilarly we have three other entries\nhere and each of those would be divided\ninto different attributes so of four\ndifferent attributes here we have 12\nattributes where each of these\nattributes have been further divided\ninto three attributes summing it up to\n12 in total so that's the uh thing so\nthat's the difference between a roll up\nand a drill down so let me go back to\nthe previous slide for a minute so in\nthis case what we did is we aggregated\nthese attributes and we reduced the\nnumber of attributes in that Dimension\nright so we converted them from four\nnumber of attributes in the form of\ncities to uh two and those being\ncountries so two attributes in this\nDimension all right so in this\nparticular Dimension we have four\ndifferent attributes and we've increased\nthat to 12 different attributes by\nadding three attributes to each and\nevery single attribute here right so\nthat's the thing that we can do with\nDimension so that's the the next\noperation that we can do on Dimensions\nright so that is the difference between\nroll up and roll down all right guys\nso all clear all right great so let's\nmove on then so the next olap operation\nthat I'm going to talk about is that of\nslice operation right so the slice\noperation provides a new subcube from\none particular dimension in a given Cube\nnow what this means is in any cube of\nours we'll have three different\ndimensions right so we have our Z axis\nhere we have our y- axis and we have our\nx- axis so three different dimensions\nhere and what the slice operation means\nis with the help of three in the three\ndifferent dimensions we can use one of\nthe dimensions and break it down into a\ntwo dimensional cube right so if you\nlook at this example here here we have\nonly our y- axis and we have our x axis\nright so the Z axis is missing now what\nwe've done is we've taken the time and\nwe've done a slice of the time so we've\ndone a slice for only quarter one so\nhere we have different representations\nfor different quarters for quarter one\nquarter 2 quarter 3 and quarter 4 now\nthe data that is displayed here is with\nrespect to only the quarter one and\nsince we've drilled down into the\nquarter and since we've taken a time as\na reference we've replaced the time\nDimension here with the location\nDimension right so this comes to the y-\naxis and the whole representation here\nis only with respect to q1 right so\nthat's what you mean with respect to\nslice so you slice one particular\nDimension and you get into the details\nof that particular Dimension with\nrespect to the other dimensions so\nthat's the slice operation and then\nmoving on to the next slide we have our\ndice right so the dice operation\nprovides a new subcube from two or more\ndimensions in a given Cube right so in\nthe earlier example we saw uh you know\nwe saw slice right so slice what it does\nis it you know gives us a new subcube\nfrom one by using one particular\ndimension in a given Cube okay but the\ndice here it gives us a new subcube from\ntwo or more dimensions in a given Cube\nso if you look at this example again we\nhave the location Dimension we have the\ntime Dimension and we have our items\nDimension here correct and what we're\ndoing here is we're using a dice for a\nlocation okay okay so we have four\ndifferent cities so we are dicing only\nfor this location of Toronto and\nVancouver right so because we are dicing\nonly for Toronto and Vancouver in our\nfinal Cube we have only Toronto and\nVancouver here correct and then we are\nalso slicing the time here so we are\ndoing a dice operation on the time with\nrespect to quarter one or quarter 2 so\nwe are only dwelling into the details of\nq1 and Q2 here and again the item is the\nthird dimension which we are dicing and\nwe are dicing it for mobile or modem so\nhere we have mobile modem phone and\nsecurity right so these two are ignored\nand we are dicing the item only for\nmobile and modem so here if you see the\nx-axis we have only mobile and modem and\nafter the dice the y axis has only q1\nand Q2 and the Z axis has only Toronto\nand Vancouver so that is the three\ndifferent dimensions that have been uh\ndiced right so if you're going to you\nknow get a new sub Cube by making use of\ntwo or more number of dimensions in your\nCube then it's called The Dice operation\nbut however if you're getting a new\nsubcube from your existing Cube by\nslicing only one particular Dimension\nthen it's called slice operation so that\nis the difference between slice and dice\nokay so we have the difference between\nroll up and drill down then you know the\ndifference between slice and dice right\nso that's the difference between these\ntwo and then finally we have one\noperation called as pivot operation so\nthe pivot operation is also known as the\nrotation operation okay it basically\ntransposes both the axis whether it's\nthe X and Y axis it transposes them them\nin order to provide an alternative\npresentation of data now if you look at\nthis example here we have the location\ndimension on the y- axis and we have the\nitem dimension on the xaxis right now\nthese two are transposed now that's what\na pivot does so when you transpose them\nyour item comes here and your location\nit comes over here your location\nDimension is here and your item\nDimension is here right so even your\ndata corresponding to them are\ntransposed so I hope you guys got the\nwhole the concept of operations right so\nthe five different operations with which\ncan be done with the help of olap data\nwarehouse so I hope you guys got the\nentire concept here right so the kind of\noperations that you can do uh using your\nuh olap activities right on your uh data\nwarehouse so that's the uh thing here\nright so these were the five different\nolap operations and uh moving on to the\nnext slide so the next topic that I'm\ngoing to talk about is that of\nDimensions all right so um the tables\nthat describe the dimensions involved\nare called d di menion tables so first\nof all to give you an example of what a\ndimension is in database you have\nsomething called as tables right so you\nhave different tables which will be a\npart of your database now similar to\ntables we have something called as\ndimensions in data warehouse so we have\nDimension tables which will have a set\nof attributes so our customer Dimension\nwill have the customer details like the\ncustomer's uh ID the customer name and\nthe customer address okay and your\nproduct Dimension will have other set of\nattributes like your product ID product\nname and your product type and similarly\nyou'll have a date Dimension which will\nhave the order date the shipment date\nand delivery date right so each of these\nDimensions here they talk about a\ndifferent aspect of your entire data\nwarehouse so your data warehouse may be\none for you know in this example it is\nthat of e-commerce company right and as\nyou can see here it says the e-commerce\ncompany here this is the subject and the\ndimensions are these and these are the\nattributes right so first of all why\nwould we need Dimensions why should we\nuse Dimensions right so we go through\nthe toule of having different dimensions\ninside our data warehouse similar to\nhaving tables in our database we have\ndifferent dimensions in our data\nwarehouse why should we have all these\nthings you can have that kind of a\nquestion now the answer to that is\ndividing your entire data warehouse\nproject into Dimensions provides\nstructured information for analysis and\nReporting right so when you break down\nyour entire data warehouse into\ndifferent dimensions like for your\ncustomer details you'll have a separate\nDimension called as customer dimension\nfor your product details you can have a\nseparate Dimension called Product\nDimension and similarly for other things\nyou can have other different dimensions\nand when you break it down in structured\nform like this your analysis and\nReporting can be very easier why because\nwhen you store data it'll be in this\nform right so you'll have your customer\nhere you'll have your customer ID the\nname address and the product that\nparticular person purchased the name of\nthe product the ID of that product the\ntype of the product and then the date as\nto when it was ordered when was it\nshipped and when was the delivery\ncompleted so you have all these these\ndetails in a structured format so that's\nwhat the benefit that dimensions and\ndata warehouse gives us right so end\nusers can simply fire queries on this\nDimension tables which contain\ndescriptive information so you'll be\nhere as an end user and you can just\nfire your simple queries on your data\nwarehouse and you will get the answer\nthat you need so that's what is the use\nof having dimensions and that's the\nbenefit right so U any doubts here guys\nthat's about dimensions and that's why\nwe should have different dimensions in\nour data warehouse project all right so\nuh moving on to the next slide so the\nnext topic that we have here is that of\nfacts and measures all right now in the\nprevious slide I spoke about Dimensions\nright so we spoke about uh there being\ndifferent dimensions in our data\nwarehouse and then we being able to sort\nthem filter them up using different\nqueries right now how do you think you\ncan run your queries and result Because\nby the look of this table you might not\nbe able to get an idea of what kind of\nDimensions you have to filter or which\nkind of Dimensions here to sort so you\nhave that kind of doubt right so that's\nwhere the whole concept of facts comes\ninto picture facts and measures so fact\nis something that helps you measure your\nDimensions so what it does let's look at\nthe definition first a fact is a measure\nthat can be summed averaged or\nmanipulated okay and every fact table it\ncontains two kinds of data a dimension\nkey and a measure all right now what\nthis means is all you will have all your\ndimensions in your data where house but\nif you want to perform any kind of query\nlike any sorting or analysis or some\nkind of drill down or all these things\nyou can only do it if you have a fact so\nfor every Dimension you will have an\nAssociated fact and using the fact you\ncan measure your Dimensions okay so\nthat's what it says here if you want to\nmeasure the data that you have in your\ndata warehouse if you want to measure\nany kind of data that is there then you\nuse the uh fact to measure your\ndimensions and that is the reason why\nyour fact table will have two kinds of\ndata it'll have a dimension key which\nwill basically be the link to your\ndimension table and then it'll have a\nmeasure so your measure is something\nthat's going to calculate the data that\nis there in your dimension right so the\ndimension key is going to let you\nconnect to your dimension and the\nwhatever data that you get from there so\nwhether it's any kind of addition or\nsubtraction or any kind of average that\nyou're going to take or the summing or\nmanipulation so whatever arithmetic\noperation that you perform that will be\nstored as a measure in your fact table\nright so that is the relation so it'll\nhave one particular Dimension key which\nwill connect to the dimension and the\nresults from here whatever the\nAggregates or whatever the operations\nperformed the results of that will be\nstored as a measure so that's the thing\nall right and it also says every\nDimension table is linked to a fact\ntable yes now that's the thing now if\nyou want to perform any kind of query or\nanalysis on any Dimension then you need\na fact table that's what we are talking\nabout in the final line here it is only\nif you have a fact table can you perform\nyou know any kind of queries or analysis\nright so that's the thing and it's also\na rule that for every Dimension table\nyou have to have a fact table so you\ncannot have any diamension table in your\ndata warehouse without a fact table and\nthat is what is the whole process that\nleads us to having a lot of flexibility\nwith respect to quering and Analysis and\nall these things right so take this\nexample in your fact table you'll have\none product Dimension and then that will\nhave a dimension key and a measure right\nso your dimension key would be that of\nproduct ID and your measure would be\nthat of the number of units sold right\nso your product can be your fact table\nand your dimension ke might be that of\nproduct ID so you'll have all the\ndifferent products that you have in your\nrepository and if you want to find the\nnumber of units sold then you can\nperform any kind of arithmetic operation\nthere and measure of that will be stored\nover here as the number of units sold so\nthat is the fact table so that's the\nwhole concept here right of facts and\nmeasures all right so uh moving on to\nthe next slide we have of schemas okay\nso uh if you remember what we spoke\nabout here right of about Dimensions\nfacts and measures so these are the uh\nimportant topics that will help you\nunderstand the whole concept of schemas\nso getting back to schemas a schema is\nbasically that which gives The Logical\ndescription of your entire database okay\nit gives details about the constraints\nplaced on the tables key values present\nand how the key values are linked\nbetween the different tables now what\nthis means is you have different\ndimensions or if you take the example of\na database you'll have different tables\nright so you'll have multiple tables\nyou'll have an employee table you'll\nhave a department table and how do you\nlink them by using the whole primary key\nforeign key relationship right so that's\nthe example that's showed over here so\nyou have one table here that is of\nemployee table and the other one is that\nof Department table and in your employee\ntable you have a department ID which\nacts as the foreign key right and then\nyou have your department table where\nDepartment ID is the primary key and you\nuse the department ID to do any lookups\ncorrect so that's the whole concept of\nschemas here in a database but whereas\nin a data warehouse we follow a similar\nmodel of primary key and foreign key\nokay but we don't use the entity\nrelationship model here however we use\nuh the star schema the snowflake schema\nand the fact constellation schema right\nso these are the three different schemas\nthat you use to establish relationships\nor right so that's what a schema is uh\nI'm pretty sure you all know what a\nschema is right so you guys should all\nhave a good idea of what a schemas and\nwhat it does but anyways talking about\nthe different types of schemas that you\nhave in your data\nwarehouse and a couple of slides earlier\nI told you that every Dimension table\nwill have a fact table right so that's\nwhat this diagram also symbolizes so if\nI can recall then over here I told you\nthat a fact table contains two kinds of\ndata a dimension key and a measure all\nright and I told you that every d\nDimension over here is supposed to have\na fact table it's supposed to be linked\nto a fact table and it would be linked\nwith the help of schemas okay so that is\nthe relationship between dimensions and\nfacts okay measures are something that\nis going to aggregate the data that is\npresent in your dimensions and it will\nstore it again in the fact table okay\nbut the fact table and the dimension\ntable will be linked with the help of\nyour schemas and your schemas if you\ntalk about schemas in the concept of\ndatabase then it would be an entity\nrelationship ship schema right based on\nthat entity relationship model they will\nbe linked right so that will be the\nrelationship but in case of a data\nwarehouse they will be using three\ndifferent types of schemas like Star\nschema or snowflake schema or fact\nconstellation schema so let's uh just\ntalk about these schemas and how the\nprimary key foreign key relationship\nworks over here okay in these three\ndifferent schemas so the first one is\nthe star schema and in our star schema\neach Dimension here in a star schema is\nrepresented with a onedimensional table\nwhich contains a set of attributes okay\nso when we say a onedimensional table it\nbasically means that there will be a\nprimary key foreign key relationship\nbetween the fact and the dimension table\nonly okay so you'll have your primary\nkey in your dimension tables and you\nwill have the associated foreign key in\nyour fact table okay so if you look at\nthe example of dealer okay this is a\ndimension table and the dealer ID is a\nprimary key okay and in the fact table\nyou have the dealer ID which is the\nforeign key now similarly for your date\nDimension table then the date ID right\nthis is the primary key and this is the\nforeign key here and for your product\nDimension table model ID is the uh\nprimary key and here model ID is the\nforeign key okay and similarly for the\nbranch Dimension table you have your\nbranch ID which is the primary key over\nhere and which is the foreign key over\nhere now when we say primary key foreign\nkey it basically means your dimension\ntable can have only one entry so each of\nyour primary key so whether in this case\nif it's your dealer ID then each dealer\ncan have only one ID right and there can\nbe only one date there can be only one\nentry for a particular date you cannot\nhave multiple entries for the same date\nand similarly you cannot have multiple\nproducts with the same ID right so you\ncannot have multiple products with the\nsame model ID and if you look at this\nexample uh you cannot have different\nbranches supposing there are three\ndifferent branches then they should have\ndifferent IDs right so they cannot have\nthe same ID so that's why we say that\nthe primary keys they cannot have\nduplicate values right so the primary\nkey over here is Branch ID which cannot\nhave duplicate values the primary key\nhere is model ID which cannot have\nduplicate values and here it's data ID\nand here it's dealer ID right so these\nare the primary keys in the four\ndifferent dimension tables which cannot\nhave duplicate values but however in a\nfact table you can have duplicate values\nright because you'll be making use of\nthe foreign key so using the foreign key\nyou'll be uh referencing to the\ndiamension table you'll be looking up to\nthe dimension table and because of that\nyou can have duplicate values there's no\nrestriction on not having duplicate\nvalues right so we have a foreign key\nrelating to all the four of our tables\nand those are the four different\ndimension keys that we have and along\nwith that we have two different measures\nright so units sold and revenue are the\ntwo different measures so Revenue we use\nRevenue to find the total number of\nproducts that we have sold so we'll have\na product ID we'll have the name model\nID and variant ID right so each of those\nproducts how many have we sold so all\nthose things will be part of our revenue\nand the same thing with units sold so\neach and product that we've sold the\nnumber of those products will be present\nhere and the money that we've made out\nof selling those products will be\npresent in our Revenue right so that is\nthe whole concept of measures here okay\nso let me just go back to this slide\nhere as you can see a fact table\ncontains two kinds of data a dimension\nkey and a measure correct a dimension\nkey and a measure a dimension key is\nbasically the foreign key here which\nwill be referencing to the primary key\nin your diamension table so that is your\ndiamension key and your measure is\nbasically the calculation or the\narithmetic value that will be stored\nbased on the operation that is performed\non your Dimensions so that's what has\nbeen explained in this slide right so\nyou have your unit sold and you have\nyour Revenue correct so these two will\nbe your measures and these four will be\nyour four different damage and keys for\nfour different tables so that's about\nyour start schema so if you understand\nyour start schema then it would be\neasier to understand the other schemas\nbecause they are just a slight variation\nokay but what you got to understand is\nthe main thing is that every Dimension\ntable will be linked to the fact table\ncorrect so that is the one thing which\nyou have to remember and talking about\nthe next point a fact table is at the\ncenter correct so the fact table is at\nthe center it contains keys to every\nDimension table and attributes all right\nso it has the keys to every different\ndimension table and it has attributes\nlike units sold and it has Revenue as\nthe other measure correct so that's the\nthing about the star schema that's how\nthis works now going to the next slide\nwe have something called as snowflake\nschema okay now it's just a slightly\nmodified version of your star schema\nwhen we say modified in uh technical\nterms we call it normalized okay and\nwhen we say normalize it means split\ninto additional tables so if you have\none table which is having a lot of\nattributes then we can break down this\ntable into further tables so that's what\nis happening over here so if you look at\nthis table you have your fact table okay\nover here in your star schema you had\nonly your dimension table and you had\nyour country idid you had location ID\nyou had all these details okay but\ninside your snowflake schema you have\nsplit this dealer table into two further\ntables one is with respect to location\nand the other is with respect to Country\nright so you have your location ID\nforeign key and your country ID foreign\nkey over here and they will be\nreferenced to your location ID primary\nkey in your location table okay and to\nyour country ID primary key in your\ncountry table right so that's how things\nwork so since your table is being\nnormalized or split into additional\ntables it's called the snowflake schema\ncorrect the same thing is done here\nright so you have something called as\nvariant ID which is again a foreign key\nand that is reference to the primary key\nwhich is inside the variant table\ncorrect as you can see so these four\nwhere the dimension tabl that were\npresent in the star schema and if you\nnormalize these tables or this data\nwarehouse further then you'll get your\nsnowflake schema right so it's further\nnormalized into additional tables so\nthat's what the difference between a\nstar schema and a snow schema is all\nright so I hope there are no doubts guys\nif any if there are any doubts please\nput that in the chat box all right so\nthat's the thing about snowflake schema\nand then now we have one more type of\nschema called as Galaxy schema okay it's\nalso called as the fact constellation\nschema and the concept here is that the\nGalaxy schema contains more than one\nfact table okay now we saw star and\nsnowflake right so here it had a single\nfact table but the number of damage\ntables were different right we had\nadditional Dimension tables and they\nwere additional Dimension tables which\nare normalized in case of our snowflake\nschema but in case of our galaxy schema\nwhere you have two fact tables right so\nyou have two fact tables and you have\nyour dimension tables such that some\nDimension tables can have more than one\nfact table okay so if you take the\nexample of our Branch Dimension and your\ndate Dimension so these two tables have\ntwo fact tables they both have the uh\nfact table of Revenue and the fact table\nof product okay but however the product\nDimension table here okay this one has\nonly one fact table that is product and\nthe dealer diamension table here has\nonly one fact table that is revenue\ncorrect so to help you understand this\nin a simpler fashion I've broken down\nthis product into another dimension\ntable right so earlier we had one\nproduct table here and here we've broken\ndown this product table into further\nproduct with respect to product ID\ncorrect so that's the whole concept here\nif you have more than one fact table\nthen it's called a Galaxy schema so this\nwould probably help you understand\ncorrect so the revenue and product are\nthe two fact tables and the dimensions\nwhich are shared are called confirmed\nDimensions so that means these two\nDimensions which are shared by more than\none fact table these two are called\nconfirmed Dimensions correct so that's\nthe whole concept of Galaxy schema so uh\nguys any\ndoubts okay so guys that was about the\nGalaxy schema all right and uh those are\nthe three different schemas that you can\nhave in your data warehouse all right so\nif you're going to work on a data\nwarehouse anytime in your future then\nyou can formulate your whole\norganization data inside data warehouse\nby using any of these schemas okay they\nare either star snowflake or Galaxy\nschemas so that's it about the schemas\nand uh yeah that's it so that's the end\nof the session and let me just summarize\nwhatever I've covered in this session\nall right so I first gave you an\nintroduction to what is data warehousing\nI spoke about what a data warehouse is\nuh how it is a benefit and what are the\nactivities involved in you know creating\na data warehouse the whole concept of\ndata warehousing and I spoke about the\narchitecture here and then I spoke about\nonline analytical processing I spoke\nabout the different types of olabs right\nwhat are the advantages of that olap has\nover oldtv and the different olap\noperations that are there that we can do\non the olap cubes so I spoke about all\nthese things and then I spoke about what\nare dimensions facts and measures so\ndiamensions was one concept that I\nstarted off from olap itself when I was\ntalking about olap operations so it\nstarted there and then we went on to\ntalk about what are dimensions facts\nmeasures and then finally I finished off\ntoday's session by talking about schemas\nright so we had three different schemas\nwith respect to Star schema snowflake\nschema and fact constellation schema so\nthese are the three different schemas\nthat I used in a data warehouse right so\nthat's it that's the end of the session\nand thank you guys thank you for\nattending the session and if you have\nany doubts please put that in the chat\nbox or you can email it to me and I'll\nget back to you immediately all right so\num all the best I'll probably meet you\nall in the next session and until then\nuh see you all take care guys I hope you\nenjoyed listening to this video please\nbe kind enough to like it and you can\ncomment any of your doubts and queries\nand we will reply to them at the\nearliest do look out for more videos in\nour playlist And subscribe to our Eda\nchannel to learn more happy
