  "text": "the iot protocol is the networking\nlanguage used by the nodes of an iot\nsystem and is critical to the overall\nviability of the deployment\nthe protocol defines the scope format\nand complexity of iot solution\nCommunications and plays a major role in\ndetermining cost and functionality\ntherefore it is important to choose the\nright protocol\nthere are two main continuums to\nconsider\npower do the sensors need to be in the\nfield on battery power for days months\nor years\nhow often do they need to report\nare disposable devices being considered\nor will replaceable or rechargeable\nbatteries be used\nconnectivity what range must the\ncommunication cover and how much data\nneed to be sent per message\nwhile the cellular provider be able to\nmaintain your connectivity or do you\nwant to keep your network and the data\nrunning on it\nwhere the demands of iot deployments\nfall along these continuities will often\nindicate which protocols they should\nconsider and what costs to expect\nthe smallest and least demanding iot\nsetup suitable for a connected home or\noffice can operate on a common Wi-Fi\nnetwork with all components continuously\npowered\nother options for proximity connectivity\nare zigbee Z-Wave and Bluetooth\neach technology has its advantages and\ndisadvantages in terms of power range\nand cost for larger areas like Farms\ncampuses or cities where small amounts\nof data transfer are needed Standalone\nlow power wide area networks will pawns\nare the perfect answered lower Awan and\nsigfox are two of the most popular Pawns\ncellular protocols like nbiot or cadm\nmay seem increasingly practical when\ntalking about coverage areas and across\nborders\ncellular iot protocols provide a way to\nleverage iot data on a regional National\nor even transcontinental scale without\nthe need for pre-established gateways to\ncreate coverage\ninstead the provider's already existing\nbase stations will transmit iot data\nthis also means that your iot will have\nthe same blind spots as cellular\nnetworks and if the network connection\nis interrupted due to maintenance\nsubscription restrictions emergencies or\nother reasons your iot will also crash\nhowever ease of deployment and coverage\noften outweighs the costs and\nlimitations of relying on cellular\nproviders\nafter watching this video if you have\nany questions please leave them in the\ncomment Zone and we will try our best to\nanswer them\n",
