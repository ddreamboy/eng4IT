  "text": "yo what's going on guys you're watching\nJavaScript for beginners lesson 45 and\nin this video we're going to talk about\nJavaScript libraries ah or I think gang\nso essentially a JavaScript library is\njust a chunk of JavaScript code that we\ncan utilize to help out with our own\ncode imagine this scenario you want to\ncreate some kind of drag-and-drop\nfeature on your website well guess what\nguys somebody's already done that\nthey've already written JavaScript for\nthat and if packed it into this thing\ncalled a JavaScript library so that we\ncan link to that file and we can use\ntheir functionality in our own script so\nwhat would normally take about 100 lines\nof code would now take about 2 or 3\nwe'll lazy it as JavaScript developers\nthat's right we don't want to write\nsomething that's already been written so\nwhy not utilize all the people's work\nthat's what JavaScript libraries are all\nabout now there's libraries for pretty\nmuch anything you can think of in\nJavaScript general-purpose libraries\nanimation farm enhancement videos plus\ntons more there's literally thousands of\nlibraries on the Internet and more added\neach day now by far the most popular\nlibrary and the one I'm going to talk\nabout in this tutorial is jQuery alright\nguys so there's a reason jQuery is so\npopular and put it simply it's freaking\nawesome it can do a lot of things in\nJavaScript so what I've done is come\nover to jQuery comm and I'm going to use\nthis in my JavaScript file what I want\nto do is click this download jQuery\nbutton right here and there's two ways I\ncan use it I can either download the\njQuery script onto my computer put it in\nthe directory of my website and link to\nthat or I can just link to a CDN version\nof the file and I prefer to do that most\nof the time now see the end just stands\nfor content delivery network and\nessentially guys that means that jQuery\nare hosting it themselves someplace so\nthat you don't have to so we can click\nthis link right here and then I'm going\nto use jQuery one we're going to get the\nminified version which is just a smaller\nsquashed version of the jQuery does\nexactly the same and when you click on\nit guys you're going to get something a\nbit like this just looks like a lot of\nrandom characters essentially just some\njunk squashed up together that my\nfriends is jQuery\nso what we're going to do is just come\nover here and grab this we're going to\ncopy that URL and then we're going to\nlink this up in our HTML file so we can\nuse it in our JavaScript alright then so\nas you can see I've got my HTML file\nopen right here and I'm just going to\nlink to that jQuery file I grab the link\nfrom so first thing I want to do is say\nscript and then I'm going to give this a\nsource attribute because we're linking\nto an external javascript file but I\npaste that URL right there and close the\ntag and now guys that is it we have\nlinked jQuery into this file so now we\ncan use it within our old JavaScript\nfiles one thing to notice which is\nreally really important I've loaded\njQuery above my own test J's file\nbecause test J's file depends on this\nand if you've got a file which depends\non jQuery you need to put it under\njQuery all right so once we've done that\nI want to talk you through this HTML now\ndead simple we're going to give with an\nidea of content and within that div I've\ngot some paragraph tags at the bottom\nwe've got this one that says grab me and\nwe're going to use jQuery to grab this\nelement and do some things with it all\nright so let's jump over to the test J's\nfile and before we do anything with\njQuery I want to show you how awkward it\nis to grab this element with a vanilla\nJavaScript we'd do something like this\nwe'd store in a variable and we'll say\nmy power and we'll set that equal to\ndocument dot get element by ID we want\nto grab that Content ID first because\nthat's where the paragraph is and then\nwithin that we want to say get elements\nby tag name and then finally we specify\nP tag and say we want which element is\nit 0 1 2 3 4 5 we want the fifth element\nin that array our ailing guys who that\nis a bit long-winded just to grab this\nlittle puny paragraph tag right well\nfortunately jQuery can do it a hell of a\nlot quicker and this is one area where\njQuery really really excels it can use\nthe Dom to great effect to grab\nwhichever element you want dead easily\nso the way we do it is this we save our\nmy power - we'll call it and we'll step\nout equal to jQuery which you\nthe dollar sign whenever we use a jQuery\nstatement we'd normally start with a\ndollar sign and then we're going to use\nour brackets and we're going to specify\nwhich element we want to grab and I'm\ngoing to grab this one now the cool\nthing we deserve jQuery is we can just\npass in a CSS selector so the CSS file\nselector for this would just be content\nkey pseudo class blast child and that my\nfriends is it is going to grab this\nelement right here how easy is that now\nif you don't know much about CSS or you\nwant to brush up on that I've got a\nplaylist on CSS on YouTube and I talked\nabout pseudo classes and different\nselectors there so you can learn about\nthat there if you don't understand this\nbut guys once you do understand it it's\nso much easier to grab elements using\njQuery alright so now we've grabbed that\nelement let's start using some methods\non it now jQuery comes with hundreds of\nmethods we can use and there's tons of\ncool ones now the first one I want to do\nis the add class method so let me\ninspect this element first of all over\nhere and I'm going to copy and paste\nthis code to store it in the console\nalright now what I'm going to do is say\nmy power to add class and this is a\njQuery function or method and I'm going\nto give it a class of tests and there my\nfriends is giving it to class\npretty cool yet likewise we can say my\npower to don't remove plus and then\nwe'll remove that class perfect now it's\ngone all right then so what else can we\ndo we can use a method called fade-out\nwe'll say my power to dot fade-out and\nyou just watch this paragraph right here\nfade it out pretty cool and my power to\nbathe in likewise and watch again if\nthey did perfect we can also control the\nCSS we'll say my power to dots CSS\nand then we pass in an object between\nthe brackets and here we can control the\nCSS properties I'll say position\nrelative and we'll say color red and now\nis giving it these properties in the CSS\ncall them red and oh there we go that's\nwhy we couldn't see it was highlighted\nand position relative now we can also\nanimate things and this is similar to\nCSS we'd still pass in CSS attributes or\nCSS properties that we want to animate\nbut it does so smoothly so let's do that\nwe'll say my power to animate and we'll\nsay passing the object left 50 pixels\nand you can see now is scoot to the left\nand it kind of slid over it did just go\nthere it animated across all right guys\nso they are a few of the functions we've\ngot this is really just touching or\nscratching the surface of jQuery there's\ntons more we can do in it and certainly\nloads more than I can cover it in one\nvideo and so what I'm going to do is a\nwhole playlist on jQuery in the future\nin fact the very near future so stay\ntuned for that but yeah if you have any\nquestions about g-s libraries in general\nor what you've seen here feel free to\ncomment down below I'll answer all of\nyour questions otherwise guys if you\nenjoy these videos don't forget to\nsubscribe and also share and like the\nvideos I'll see you in a net one\n",
