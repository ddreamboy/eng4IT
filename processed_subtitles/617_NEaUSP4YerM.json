genetics\ndepartment at the University of North\nCarolina at Chapel Hill\ntoday we're going to be talking about T\nSnee or tis knee to be honest I don't\nactually know how it's pronounced but\nit's gonna be clearly explained I know\nthat bet also this stack quest is by\nrequest a couple of people put it in the\ncomments below and I got a couple of\nemails from other people so I'm doing it\nbecause you guys want it here goes if\nyou're watching this stack quest chances\nare you've seen an example of a tea\nsneak graph before what tea Snee does is\nit takes a high dimensional data set and\nreduces it to a low dimensional graph\nthat retains a lot of the original\ninformation if you're not familiar with\nthose terms of taking a high dimensional\ndata set and reducing it to a low\ndimensional graph you might want to\nwatch the stat quest for pca because i\nexplain what that means in that video\nhere's a basic 2d scatter plot let's do\na walk through of how tea stain would\ntransform this graph into a flat one\ndimensional plot on a number line I'm\ngoing to use this super simple example\nto explain the concepts behind tea Snee\nso that when you see it applied to a\nmuch larger data set a much more complex\ndata set you'll still know how that\ngraph was drawn note if we just\nprojected the data onto one of the axes\nwe just get a big mess that doesn't\npreserve the original clustering if we\nproject it on to the y axis instead of\ntwo distinct clusters we just see a\nmishmash and the same thing happens if\nwe just project the data onto the x axis\nwhat T Snee does is find a way to\nproject data into a low dimensional\nspace in this case the one-dimensional\nnumber line so that the clustering in\nthe high dimensional space in this case\nthe 2-dimensional scatterplot is\npreserved so let's step through the\nbasic ideas of how tasty does this we'll\nstart with the original scatter plot\nthen we'll put the points on the number\nline in a random order from here on out\nT sneem moves these points a little bit\nat a time until it has clustered them\nlet's figure out where to move this\nfirst point should it move a little to\nthe left or a little to the right\nbecause it is part of this cluster in\nthe two-dimensional scatter plot it\nwants to move closer to these points but\nat the same time these points are far\naway in the scatter plot so they push\nback these points attract while these\npoints repel in this case the attraction\nis strongest\nso the point moves a little to the right\nBAM now let's move this point a little\nbit these points attract because they\nare close to each other in the\ntwo-dimensional scatter plot and this\npoint repels a little bit because it is\nfar from the point in the\ntwo-dimensional scatter plot so it moves\na little closer to the other orange\npoints\ndouble bam at each step a point on the\nline is attracted to points it is near\nin the scatterplot and repelled by\npoints it is far from\ntriple bail now that we've seen what tea\nSnee tries to do let's dive into the\nnitty-gritty details of how it does what\nit does step 1 determine the similarity\nof all the points in the scatter plot\nfor this example let's focus on\ndetermining the similarities between\nthis point and all of the other points\nfirst measure the distance between two\npoints then plot that distance on a\nnormal curve that is centered on the\npoint of interest\nlastly draw a line from the point to the\ncurve the length of that line is the\nunscaled similarity I made that\nterminology up but it'll make sense in\njust a bit so hold on\nnow we calculate the unscaled similarity\nfor this pair of points now we calculate\nthe unscaled similarity for this pair of\npoints and now we calculate the unscaled\nsimilarity for this pair of points etc\netc etc using a normal distribution\nmeans that distant points have very low\nsimilarity values and close points have\nhigh similarity values ultimately we\nmeasure the distances between all of the\npoints and the point of interest then\nplot them on a normal curve and then\nmeasure the distances from the points to\nthe curve to get the unscaled similarity\nscores with respect to the point of\ninterest the next step is to scale the\nunscaled similarities so that they add\nup to 1 um why do the similarity scores\nneed to add up to 1 it has to do with\nsomething I didn't tell you earlier and\nto illustrate the concept I need to add\na cluster that is half as dense as the\nothers the width of the normal curve\ndepends on the density of data near the\npoint of interest less dense regions\nhave wider curves so if these points\nhave 1/2 the density as these points and\nthis curve is half as wide as this curve\nthen scaling the similarity scores will\nmake them the same for both clusters\nhere's an example where I've worked out\nthe math this curve has a standard\ndeviation equal to 1 these are the\nunscaled similarity values this curve\nhas a standard deviation equal to 2\nthese points are twice as far from the\nmiddle the unscaled similarity values\nare half of the other ones\nto scale the similarity scores so that\nthey sum to one you take a score and you\ndivided by the sum of all the scores\nthat equals the scaled score here's how\nthe math works out when the distribution\nhas a standard deviation equals to one\nwe get zero point eight two and zero\npoint one eight as the scaled similarity\nscores and here's the math for when\neverything is spread out twice as much\nwe get zero point eight two and zero\npoint one eight the similarity scores on\ntop are equal to the similarity scores\nbelow they are the same\nthat implies that the scaled similarity\nscores for this relatively tight cluster\nare the same for this relatively loose\ncluster the reality is a little more\ncomplicated but only slightly T Snee has\na perplexity parameter equal to the\nexpected density around each point and\nthat comes into play but these clusters\nare still more similar than you might\nexpect now back to the original scatter\nplot we've calculated similarity scores\nfor this point now we do it for this\npoint and we do it for all the points\none last thing and the scatter plot will\nbe all set with similarity scores\nbecause the width of the distribution is\nbased on the density of the surrounding\ndata points the similarity score for\nthis node might not be the same as the\nsimilarity to this node so T Snee just\naverages the two similarity scores from\nthe two directions no big deal\nultimately you end up with a matrix of\nsimilarity scores each row and column\nrepresents the similarity scores\ncalculated from that point of interest\nred equals high similarity and white\nequals low similarity I've drawn the\nsimilarity from a point of interest to\nitself as dark red however it doesn't\nreally make sense to say that a point is\nsimilar to itself because that doesn't\nhelp the clustering so T's knee actually\ndefines that similarity as zero hooray\nwere done calculating similarity scores\nfor the scatter plot now we randomly\nproject the data onto the number line\nand calculate similarity scores for the\npoints on the number line just like\nbefore that means picking a point\nmeasuring a distance and lastly drawing\na line from the point to a curve however\nthis time we're using a t-distribution\na t-distribution is a lot like a normal\ndistribution except the tea isn't as\ntall in the middle and the tails are\ntaller on the ends the t-distribution is\nthe tea in tea stay we'll talk about why\nthe t-distribution is used in a little\nbit\nso using a t-distribution we calculate\nunscaled similarity scores for all the\npoints and then scale them like before\nlike before we end up with a matrix of\nsimilarity scores but this matrix is a\nmess compared to the original matrix the\ngoal of moving this point is we want to\nmake this row look like this row t Snee\nmoves the points a little bit at a time\nedit each step it chooses a direction\nthat makes the matrix on the left more\nlike the matrix on the right it uses\nsmall steps because it's a little bit\nlike a chess game and can't be solved\nall at once instead it goes one move at\na time BAM\nnow to finally tell you why the\nt-distribution is used without it the\nclusters would all clump up in the\nmiddle and be harder to see triple bam\nand now we know how teeny works i've\nused a really simple example here but\nthe concepts are the exact same for more\ncomplicated data sets\nhooray we've made it to the end of\nanother exciting stack quest if you like\nthis stack quest and want to see more\nlike it please subscribe and if you have\nany ideas for future stack quests just\nput them in the comments below until\nnext time quest on\n",
