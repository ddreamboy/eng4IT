  "text": "have you ever thought there's got to be\na better and simpler way to learn\norganizational strategies five minutes\nlearning has a global and diverse\ncollection of case studies to help\nmanagement students click the Subscribe\nbutton and hit the Bell icon to stay\nupdated with our upcoming and\ninteresting case studies\nStarbucks doesn't just sell beverages\nall over the world it also collects a\nlot of data from over 100 million\ntransactions per week\nwhat does it do with this information\nand how do artificial intelligence and\nThe Internet of Things play a role in\nthis\nregardless of the size of your company\nStarbucks can be a great example of how\nto use data and modern technology to\ngain a competitive advantage\nfor example it is a Pioneer in combining\nloyalty Systems payment cards and mobile\napps\nbut that is only the tip of the iceberg\nthis video highlights five of the most\ninteresting examples of how Starbucks\nuses data artificial intelligence and\niot to gain a competitive advantage\nStarbucks May no longer be a coffee\ncompany but rather a data technology\ncompany for food and beverages\nit's no secret that Starbucks is a\ndata-driven company it operates over 30\n000 stores worldwide and processes\nnearly 100 million transactions per week\nthis provides it with an in-depth\nunderstanding of what its customers\nconsume and enjoy\nit may surprise you to learn that\nStarbucks only started focusing on data\nvalue a little more than a decade ago it\nwasn't that it hadn't used Data before a\ncrisis prompted the company's\ntransformation as with many major\nchanges\nin this case the change was prompted by\nthe 2008 financial blip and subsequent\nstore closures\nthis taught Howard Schultz then CEO of\nStarbucks that data should be used more\nanalytically\nprior to that Starbucks like many other\norganizations made decisions based on\nexperience and judgment\nchoosing the right location is critical\nto success in retail in 2007 and 2008\nStarbucks CEO Howard Schultz was forced\nto come out of retirement to close\nhundreds of stores and rethink the\ncompany's strategic growth plan\nthis time Starbucks took a more\ndisciplined data-driven approach to\nstore openings\nthe company can choose the most\nstrategic location for its new stores by\nusing location-based analytics powered\nby Atlas a mapping and business\nintelligence tool developed by esri\nbefore recommending a new store location\nStarbucks evaluates massive amounts of\ndata including variables such as\npopulation income levels traffic\ncompetitor presence and proximity to\nother Starbucks locations\nusing this information the company can\nforecast revenues profits and other\naspects of economic performance for that\nlocation\nthe software is also assisting in\ndetermining where the next 1500 Plus\nstores should be located which will not\nonly help the company expand but will\nalso Drive revenue for new store\ndevelopments\nStarbucks used the gathered data to\ndetermine which products to offer when\nlaunching new products\nin particular when expanding its product\nlines into grocery stores the company\nheavily relies on the data gathered\naccording to a study 43 of tea drinkers\navoid adding sugar\nStarbucks created a new product line of\nunsweetened iced teas to cater to this\nMarket\nalso after discovering that 25 of\nconsumers do not add milk to their\ncoffee the company launched a new line\nof black iced coffee without milk\nthese menu enhancements and grocery\nstore product launches are not only just\nproviding customers with their favorite\nproducts they're also about convincing\ntheir customers to avoid other coffee\nbrands while at home\nit's a market share grab strategy that's\nbeen hugely successful it's a way for\nStarbucks to take a retail brand and\nbring it into consumers homes\nwhen Starbucks launched its Rewards\nprogram and mobile app its data\ncollection increased significantly\nthis allowed them to get to know their\ncustomers and extract information about\ntheir purchasing habits\nusing its mobile app Starbucks collects\ndata about what where and when its\nmembers purchase coffee\nStarbucks uses the digital flywheel\nprogram a cloud-based artificial\nintelligence engine capable of making\nprecise food and beverage\nrecommendations\nas a result even when people visit a new\nStarbucks location the store's point of\nsale system can identify the customer\nthrough their phone and give the Barista\ntheir preferred order\nStarbucks could also suggest new\nproducts a customer might like based on\ntheir purchase history as well as\nprovide unique discounts and rewards on\nspecific items based on their unique\npreferences\nStarbucks went one step further by\ncollecting data on weather patterns and\ntheir relationship with customer order\npatterns\nthis enables the company to provide even\nmore personalized experiences and\npromotions such as delivering cold\ndrinks to a customer on hot days\none implication of the preceding\nexamples is that Starbucks can\nconstantly refine and adjust its\nofferings\nStarbucks data-driven approach allows it\nto make changes based on customers\nlocation and time\nthis has an impact on products\npromotions and pricing however if you're\nin store offerings are displayed on\nprinted menu boards above the counter\nthere is a disconnect with the ability\nto constantly adjust things\nthis is one of the reasons why retailers\ncontinue to favor low-tech Solutions\nsuch as blackboards\nStarbucks on the other hand sees the\nsolution as a rollout of digital signage\nin stores with computer-generated menu\ndisplays\nthis completes a chain that allows\nchanges in the customer experience to be\nreflected in the store\nobviously this raises a slew of\nquestions and there's plenty of room for\nthings to get complicated\nhowever as of mid-2018 Starbucks was\nonly testing this in a few locations\nit concentrated its efforts on promoting\nspecific products based on local factors\nsuch as weather or time of day\nour final example as coffee machine\nmaintenance and General in store\nmachinery\nthe typical in-store Starbucks\ntransaction is relatively low cost and\nshort-lived\na store success is dependent on high\nlevels of customer throughput so when a\nmachine fails it can have a significant\nimpact on business performance\nStarbucks doesn't keep Engineers on site\nfor breakdowns instead they send them\nout to deal with repairs and to perform\nplanned maintenance\nhaving Engineers respond quickly to\nBroken machines makes a difference there\nare conventional approaches to this\nproblem this typically means collecting\ndata about failures machine usage\nrepairs required and so on\nregular data analytics as effective at\nidentifying Trends and patterns AI can\nassist in taking this to the next level\nby forecasting breakdowns and\nmaintenance requirements\nStarbucks has taken a step forward by\ndeveloping a new coffee machine the\ncloverex currently this is only used in\nFlagship and concept stores\nit's not only Cutting Edge in terms of\ncoffee making capability but it's also\nCloud connected\nthis not only enables a more\ncomprehensive collection of operational\ndata it also enables remote fault\ndiagnosis and even remote repairs\nsimilar ideas will apply to other\nmachines for example stores now have a\nstandard oven that is also computer\ncontrolled to ensure consistent\npreparation of Hot Products around the\nworld\nhowever the current machines need to be\nupdated by USB drive\nthis occurs Whenever there is a change\nin machine configuration such as the\nintroduction of new products\nin the future this will undoubtedly\nbecome a direct Cloud connection opening\nup more AI opportunities\nwhile Starbucks was not born in the\ndigital era as a digitally native\ncompany it has successfully integrated\nnew technologies into its Core Business\ndata analytics has unquestionably become\nthe backbone of Starbucks continuous\nimprovement over the years in the future\nStarbucks will continue to gather more\ndata and apply it in even more\ninnovative ways to provide a more\npersonalized customer experience and\nAchieve business excellence\nStarbucks as a textbook example of how\nto start a journey to utilize data\nstrategically implementing plans\nsystematically and thoroughly\nanother lesson is that artificial\nintelligence as part of Starbucks\njourney to learn how to use data using\nartificial intelligence was not\nsomething that happened out of a burning\ndesire\nit was just a matter of doing it when\nthe time was right in each area\nthank you so much for listening to this\nvideo do not forget to subscribe this\nYouTube channel for receiving updates\nabout my upcoming case study videos\n",
