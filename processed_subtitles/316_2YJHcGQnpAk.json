  "text": "About 4 months ago I built this greenhouse\nin my garden which as you can see now houses\nwell growing plants.\nI got cucumbers, strawberries, sugar melon,\nwatermelon, tomatoes and bell peppers of which\nsurprisingly not one died yet.\nBut that does not mean that everything goes\nperfectly which you can easily figure out\nif we look at certain leaves or this stem.\nThe problem is a fungus which was caused by\nhigh humidity and could have been avoided\nif I opened the window more often.\nBut on the positive side, this problem planted\nthe idea of an automated greenhouse inside\nmy head.\nThis system should measure the temperature,\nhumidity and soil moisture inside the greenhouse;\nsend this data through a LoRa wireless connection\nto a gateway in my apartment 300m away which\nthen uploads it to the Internet of Things\nwebsite where I can check on it everywhere\nin the world.\nAnd as a bonus the system should also be able\nto use motors in order to not only open the\nwindow to control the temperature and humidity\nbut also to water the plants if the soil moisture\nis too low.\nAnd of course this automated greenhouse should\nget powered through the sun and thus also\nrequires a solar power system.\nAnd in this first part of this two part video\nseries I will show you how I built the green\nhouse, how I wired up the power and sensor\nsystem and what kind of programming is necessary\nin order to get all the required sensor data\ninto the internet.\nThis video is sponsored by JLCPCB, where you\ncan now buy 5 pieces of 4 layer PCBs for a\nprice of only 5$.\nSo why not upload your Gerber files today\nin order to experience their 24h fast production\ntime, super quick delivery and excellent quality\nPCBs.\nTo start off this project I searched for a\nbig yet affordable greenhouse on the internet\nand I found this one with measurements of\n190 by 380cm.\nAs soon as I received it, I opened up the\npackage which contained the metal foundation\nand laid it onto my lawn to determine a suitable\nspot.\nThen I cut the grass, marked the greenhouse\nsquare with a spade and started breaking up\nthe grass and afterwards removed most of it.\nWhile doing so I also had the unique experience\nof removing a dead tree stump which I will\nhopefully never have to do again in my life.\nBut anyway as soon as that was done I distributed\nthe soil in my square a bit more evenly and\ncontinued by screwing together the metal foundation\nwhich I then moved into position.\nAfter I was certain that the foundation was\nlevel by obviously utilizing a spirit level,\nI opened up the remaining packages which contained\nthe main parts for the greenhouse.\nAnd according to the given manual we then\nconnected all aluminum beams with one another\nthrough the help of the included connector\npieces and screws.\nNow this part sounds like it was simple to\ndo but in reality it took quite a while to\nfind the correct aluminum parts and connectors\nsince the manual was not always that easy\nto follow.\nBut nevertheless after a few hours we completed\nthe metal construction on the lawn before\nwe moved it all over to the foundation to\nwhich we then secured it with more connectors\nand screws.\nAt this point all that was left to do was\nto add the plastic windows which had to get\nsecured in place with dozens of clips.\nAnd just like that the greenhouse itself was\nsuccessfully built.\nNow at this point I do not want to bore you\nwith plant growing tutorials, so let’s just\nsay that suddenly lots of plants appeared\nin my greenhouse and let’s instead continue\nwith the electronics.\nThere we can distinguish between the power\nelectronics and the automation electronics.\nFor the power electronics we need a 12V lead\nacid battery, a solar panel and a solar charge\ncontroller and luckily for me I had those\nthree components laying around from previous\nprojects.\nTo be specific I got this 12V 44Ah car battery\nwhich is a bit of an overkill considering\nthat the sensor system will ultimately only\ndraw around 24mA; but the big capacity will\ncome in handy when later trying to power motors.\nThen I got this 10W 12V solar panel which\nin combination with this generic solar charge\ncontroller will charge up the battery with\na current of up to 0.56A.\nTo test this I wired up the power electronics\nsystem in my garden according to this wiring\ndiagram.\nSadly though the sun didn’t feel like working\nwith me that day but trust me when I say that\nlater when the sun was shining, the battery\nwas charging without any problems.\nSo next I ordered myself this wooden chest\nfrom the internet into which all the electronics\nwill fit later on.\nBefore putting them in there though I added\na layer of wood glaze to the chest in order\nto protect it better from the elements.\nNext I also created two small wood blocks\nand one big square of plywood with the help\nof my jigsaw.\nI added the two wood blocks on top of the\nchest lid with screws and then mounted the\nbig plywood square on top of it all at an\nangle.\nAnd as you would have guessed at this point,\nthis is the roof of my electronics housing\nwhich means I also had to add a bit of roofing\npaper.\nSo with the housing being completed, I got\nmyself lots of this silicone wire with 2,\n3 and 5 conductors inside which is even suited\nto be mounted inside a sauna.\nWhat I did next was adding the solar panel\nto the roof with Velcro tape to which I then\nalso secured one silicone wire through the\nhelp of wire pedestals and zip ties.\nI then soldered this wire directly to the\nsolar panel before I positioned the chest\nenclosure in front of the greenhouse.\nThere I then drilled 4 more additional holes\ninto the chest of which I immediately used\none in order to guide the solar panel wire\nthrough.\nInside the chest I wired up the solar charge\ncontroller to the battery and solar panel\nlike I described it before and just like that\nthe power electronics parts was done and it\nwas time to move on to the automation part\nstarting with this PCB I ordered from the\ninternet.\nAs you can see it features an Arduino microcontroller\nas well as an RFM95 LoRa Transceiver.\nBesides this board we will also need capacitive\nsoil moisture sensors of which I will be using\ntwo, one on each side of the greenhouse, as\nwell as such a BME280 temperature and humidity\nsensor and also a LoRa Gateway like this LG02\none about which you can also learn more in\nmy LoRa video.\nThe general working principle pretty much\nstays the same like I described it in the\nbeginning but let me add that the Arduino\nwill send out the data every 60s and we will\nbe using LoRaWAN\nSo what I did first was hooking up all of\nthe sensors to the LoRa board for a first\ntest run according to this schematic which\nwill pretty much not change later on.\nYou might also have noticed that I added an\nadditional 5V regulator on the power input\nwhich was definitely mandatory to add because\nthe board apparently cannot handle 12V.\nBut anyway the soil moisture sensor outputs\nan analog voltage from 0 to 3V depending on\nhow moist the earth around it is.\nAnd the BME280 sensor uses an I2C interface\nto send over its temperature and humidity\ndata which means we could use its datasheet\nto write proper I2C code but then again there\nalso exists a simpler to use Arduino library\nfor it.\nWith those information in mind I firstly created\na simple example code that outputs all of\nthe sensor data through the serial monitor\nand after using an FTDI breakout board hooked\nup to the serial interface of the LoRa board\nand uploading the code, it seems like everything\nworks just fine.\nThat was the easy part though because now\nit was time to establish the LoRaWAN connection\nfor which I not only had to sign up on the\nThings Network site and edit the settings\nof the LoRa Gateway but I also had to use\nsome rather complicated code.\nHowever this process was surprisingly simple\nto do because the Gateway manual describes\nin detail how to set everything up.\nBefore uploading though I had to connect two\nof the RFM95 board pins to two pins of the\nArduino because the utilized LoRaWAN library\nrequires them.\nAnd after uploading the final code to the\nArduino LoRa board, we can see on the Things\nNetwork site that the data gets uploaded successfully\nin HEX which converted into ASCII turns out\nto be our measured temperature, humidity and\nanalog values for the soil moisture sensor,\nawesome.\nThat means it was time for me to design a\nsmall housing for the BME280 sensor and 3D\nprint it before I once again headed into my\ngarden.\nThere I soldered the wires to the two soil\nmoisture sensors as well as the BME280 sensor\nand then waterproofed the soil sensors with\na layer of nail polish.\nAfterwards I secured the BME280 sensor with\nits wire inside the greenhouse to the wall\nwith wire pedestals and zip ties and pushed\nthe soil sensors into well the earth.\nLast but not least I drilled three holes into\nthe foundation of the greenhouse through which\nI then guided all the wires which ultimately\ngot soldered to the LoRa board inside the\nchest.\nAnd as soon as the power wiring was also done,\nthe first part of this project was basically\ncomplete and if we once again check the Things\nNetwork site you can see that everything still\nworks fine.\nI hope you enjoyed this video, if so don’t\nforget to like, share, subscribe and hit the\nnotification bell.\nStay creative and I will see you next time.\n",
