  "text": "[MUSIC]\nMy name is\nShannon Ellis.\nI am an assistant teaching\nprofessor in HDSI,\nso the Halicioglu Data\nScience Institute\nin the Cognitive\nScience Department.\nI focus mainly on teaching\nlarge undergraduate data science\nand programming courses to\nour wonderful undergraduates\nhere at UC San Diego.\n[MUSIC]\nThis question should\nbe way easier than it actually\nis because it's hotly\ndebated in the field.\nEverybody has their\nown definition.\nMine, I try to keep\nit simple and sweet.\nData science, to me,\nis the scientific process of\nextracting value from data.\nThat value could be monetary,\nbut it also could be\nvalue in the context\nof knowledge or gained\ninformation in some way.\n[MUSIC]\nData science is\nrelevant now for as many reasons\nas you could possibly think of.\nWe are awash in data.\nOur phones are constantly\ncollecting data on us.\nEvery time we send an email,\nthat's a whole bunch of data.\nSo we have more data than\nwe've ever had before,\nboth on the individual level\nand at the population level,\njust with the way technology\nhas gone over the\npast few decades.\nHaving these data mean that\nwe can then extract more value.\nWe can ask more\ninteresting questions.\nThink of your favorite\nfield, and there's\na data science question and\na data science approach\nto answer that question.\nSimply by having the\ndata, and having\nthe technology and the ways\nto store the data and\nprocess the data,\nwe're able to ask way\nmore interesting questions\nthan we used to.\n[MUSIC]\nI do actually have\nan aha moment.\nAs an undergraduate, I was\na biology major, and I\nwas working with somebody named\nJeremiah [inaudible] at King's\nCollege in Wilkes-Barre,\nPennsylvania, so this tiny\nliberal arts college.\nHe and I worked together\nfor four years.\nI had done research with him.\nHe knew I had an\ninterest in genetics.\nHe knew I wanted to do research.\nWe worked on these little\nthings called microarrays.\nYou extract RNA, and then\nyou put a whole bunch of\nwashes over top of them,\nand the end, you get this tiny,\nlittle slide that the\ncolors on it represent\nthe relative levels of\nexpression for this thing\nthat we're studying,\nwhich is called Cryptococcus\nneoformans fungus.\nAll of that said, I spent\nmonths preparing these slides.\nThen we took the slides\nto a scanner, and we put\nthem through the\nscanner, and it took\na picture of my slide,\nand that picture was my data.\nI had spent months pipetting\nthings in little tubes,\nnot really seeing what was\ngoing on to get this picture.\nSo I hold a bunch of\nthese pictures and\nthen there was a\nsoftware that we\nused to analyze the data.\nI entered my pictures and\nout came the results.\nI was, like, what just\nhappened when I\nclicked that button?\nI asked my professor, I\nsaid, what's going on?\nHow did it go from that picture\nto those numbers\nto those results?\nHe said to me, if you\nweren't about to graduate,\nI would teach you Python.\nI thought to myself,\nnote to self,\ngo Google that when you get back\nbecause I didn't know\nwhat Python was.\nI Googled Python. I\nlearned it was a\nprogramming language.\nAt that aha moment, I was, like,\nI want to understand\nanalysis so that I don't\nhave to trust this\npiece of software,\neven though it might\nbe trustworthy.\nI want to understand\nwhat's happening in\nthat black box when I click\n\"Go\" to get my results.\nAt that point I was,\nlike, I'm going\nto continue on research\nbecause that's what I want\nto do at the time, doing\nsomething that I will\nlearn to do computation,\nwhatever that meant, until I\nchose graduate programs\nwhere there was\na deep statistical set of\ncourses and that I\nwould be able to join\na lab where I would\nlearn computation.\nThat was my aha moment\nwhere I was, like,\nhow did it decide those\nthings for me, after I spent\nmonths, in a second to come\nup with those answers?\n[MUSIC]\nI sometimes joke\nwith other people who ask about\nmy job, and I say it's really\neasy because data science is\nthat hot thing that all the\nstudents want to learn.\nNobody is going to come\ninto my class and be, like,\nwhen am I ever\ngoing to use this,\nbecause students have\nthis understanding\nthat these skills are\napplicable as they go forward.\nBut in the classroom,\nit changes a ton.\nStudents come in thinking and\nknowing that they're\ninterested in this concept\nof data science without having\na full and deep understanding\nof what that means.\nFor example, they come\nin, and they're like, AI,\nmachine learning, that's\nthe hot new thing.\nI want to do that.\nI try to rein them\nin a little bit in the\nclassroom, and I'm, like,\nthe techniques used for\nmachine learning problems\nare super interesting.\nBut let's spend the time talking\nabout the ethical approaches.\nWhat do you need to\nthink about the data,\nare your data complete,\nand to really think about\nall those steps leading up\nto using your new favorite\nmachine learning algorithm,\ntrying to add the context, and\nthe ethics, and the\ndeep thinking students\nneed so that they\ncan go on to do\nthose interesting\nalgorithmic approaches\nthat they want to do,\nand that's what I try to\ndo inside the classroom.\n[MUSIC]\nThe specific challenges\nfor accessing information,\nI have a few thoughts, and\nthey're not all tied together.\nFor the first one,\nI'm going to put on\nmy biology hat and\nmy genetics hat,\nwhich is what my background is.\nThere, if you got\ngovernment funding in\nthe United States and wanted\nto publish your work,\nit has been established\nfor a while\nthat you have to make\nthe data public.\nThe data are available, and\nthis is so that\nothers can either\nreproduce your work or\nreplicate your work, or\nso that others can use the data\nin some other way\nthat works for them.\nSo the data are there,\nbut often they're in\nthese huge systems.\nThey're not well annotated,\nmeaning, you don't\nknow much about\nthe data or the sample\nthat it came from,\nor they're hard to\nget out. You still\nhave to do a ton of processing.\nThey take a ton of space.\nThere's access issues.\nNot that the data aren't\nthere for you to use,\nbut more it's not a trivial\nprocess to actually use them.\nI think that's one side of\nthe spectrum that's actually\nan easier to access issue.\nThe other side,\nin the classroom,\nin one of my courses,\nwe do group projects.\nI don't do them.\nMy students do group\nprojects that I ask them to\ndo, and I have them\nstart with the question.\nI tried to tell them, think\nof a topic that you're\ninterested in that would\nhelp your community,\nwould help your family,\nthat would help\nlarge society and they can\nchoose whatever they want.\nThey have to come up\nwith their question\nbefore they go find their data.\nSometimes they come up with\nreally interesting questions,\nbut the data are going\nto be proprietary,\nmeaning, a company has\nthose data for sure.\nYou want to analyze\nthe sentiments people are\nsaying on Twitter over\nsome period of time and look\nat how it corresponds to\npolitics, for example.\nTwitter has what's\nknown as an API,\nso you can get some\ndata from Twitter.\nBut if you work inside Twitter,\nyou would have access\nto a lot more data.\nI'm using Twitter as\nan example there for\nvery good reasons.\nCompanies don't give you\naccess to all of their data,\nboth for monetary\nreasons that they\nhave and for privacy reasons.\nI'm not saying it's\na problem so much\nas the barrier is sometimes\nyou have a really great idea,\nthe data exist,\nbut they just don't exist to\nyou, and so you just won't\nbe able to access them.\n[MUSIC]\nTypically, my work\nstarts with a question.\nThere's something\nI want to answer,\nand I try to mimic that\nfor students as well\nbecause it can be really\neasy to go search\non the Internet for\nan available dataset and\nthen form a question\naround that,\nbut that's not really what\nyou end up doing at work.\nYour company actually is\ngoing to be, like, go look at\nthe data and see\nwhat you can ask.\nTypically, they're\ngoing to say, we have\nthese benchmarks\nwe want to ask a question about,\nbut we want to see why\nthis isn't working\nas intended, and you\nanswer that question.\nSo for me, it starts\nwith a question, and\nthen it starts with,\ndo I have the data to answer it,\nand simultaneously, do I have\nthe knowledge background\nto answer it?\nThis is something I also\ntry to teach students.\nYou can ask a really\ninteresting question.\nBut if you've never thought\nabout that topic before,\nyou have to do your\ndue diligence.\nYou need to do\nbackground research.\nYou need to read\nother publications,\nyou need to get some\nknowledge in that area\nbefore you can do any analysis.\n[MUSIC]\nIn my own work now, I\nmostly ask questions about\nthe classrooms that I teach in,\nand so it's a whole other\ncan of worms. I have the data,\nit's a handful of questions.\nOne is, what can I use\nthese data for ethically?\nA lot of working with\nthe IRB, which is\nthe Institutional\nReview Board, which is\na great body that exists at\nevery academic institution,\nand so I tell them what\nI want to do and they\ntell me if that's okay\nand they are experts,\nso they are great people\nto get to know. Then the\nsecond is there's a ton of\nvariability in education.\nEvery quarter, every term,\nI have different students,\nso how can I compare\nthis term to\nlast term when it's\nnot the same people?\nWhat if I want to\nchange up how I\nask one question on a survey,\nor clearly my exams aren't\nthe same from one\nquarter to another,\nso it's not as much as\nthe data accessibility\nbut what information do\nthese data have, and\nwhat can I use, and\nwhat should I not ask,\nand what should I not\nuse, and talking to the\nexperts there as well.\nMe asking questions\nof my students\ndoesn't put them nearly at\nas much risk as like me opening\nup someone's skull and\ndoing brain surgery.\nOf course, not every biological\nhuman subject research\nis opening up someone's brain,\nbut there's less inherent risks.\nSo there are different procedures\nthat you go through with\nthe IRB just because\nthe risks are lower.\nWhen I submit things to the IRB,\nthey want to see the\nsurveys I'm asking.\nThey want to see what\nI've communicated to\nstudents about how\ntheir data are going\nto be used and what those\nstudents expectations were.\nThey're really coming at it with\nthe lens of protecting students\nand student information while\nat the same time\nknowing and just being\nrealistic that these\nstudents are being\nput at as much risk\nas they could be in other\nhuman subjects research.\nWe do have different paths\nand different avenues there,\nbut there they are protecting\nstudents, and they're\nprotecting student's\nprivacy as well,\nmaking sure how are we\ngoing to anonymize data?\nIs it truly anonymized?\nIs something identifiable,\neven if you remove\ntheir names, for\nexample? It is a different lens.\nIt is not as thought of\nharm and risk, even though\nof course they're trying to\nprotect students as some\nhuman subjects research,\nbut I found the process to\nbe really thoughtful. Every time\nI submitted something\nand gotten something\nback being like, Did\nyou think of this?\nHow are you handling\nthis? Have you considered\nabout this identification\nprocess from the IRB?\nIt's just made me more\nthoughtful through\nthe process as well.\nWhen I think about data\naccess and data flow;\ngetting the data sometimes\neasier than others,\nonce you have the\ndata and you've\ndetermined that it can\nanswer your question\nI try to encourage\nmy students and\nmyself to do tons of\nexploratory data analysis.\nBy that I mean get to\nknow your data deeply.\nWho has missing information?\nWhat are the typical values?\nDoes anybody have\na value that looks\nway off, and there could\nhave been an error?\nIf something's missing, is it\nmissing at random,\nor is it missing\nnot at random, and how are\nwe going to consider that?\nThis is deep. Get to know your\ndata to convince yourself\neven further that it is the data\nyou need to answer\nthat question.\nIt's a really important\npart of this data flow.\nSometimes it's\ncircular, where you're,\nlike, \"Do this exploration.\"\nYou're like, \"These\naren't what I need.\nI either need to go back and\ndo a different experiment,\nor I need to go back and talk to\nthe company about the data\nthat they have and\nthis isn't going to\nwork or a different format.\"\nThat process often doesn't\nshow up in your resulting work.\nYou don't talk about, in\nyour report or your paper,\nall the things that\nfailed in the middle, and\nthat's just part of the process,\nso I like to talk about that.\nYou make mistakes, your\nquestion is not great,\nyou didn't get the\ndata you need,\nyou explore it and realize\nyou didn't have enough,\nand you have to go back\nto the drawing board and\neither ask a different question\nbecause you're not going\nto answer it or get different\ndata to be able to see\nthe process through to\nthe end where you do\nthe analysis and you write\nthe report or you\nwrite the paper.\nIn graduate school I was\nanalyzing the genetic\nbasis of autism.\nI was in a lab at a School\nof Medicine, and we had\nsamples from individuals who\nare affected with autism\nand those who were not,\nand these were\npostmortem samples.\nSo these are individuals\nwho had passed away\nand who had donated\ntheir brains to science,\nand I was analyzing these data.\nThe closest I got to\nthe autistic population\nwas looking at this\nspreadsheet of\ninformation I knew about\nthese people which gave me\nvery little\ninformation about who\nthey were or even what\ntheir \"autism\" was.\nWe know it's this huge spectrum.\nI wasn't there integrated\nwith the autistic community.\nI wasn't asking\nabout their needs.\nI wasn't communicating\nwith them.\nI'm, like, \"If I'm\ndoing this research,\nwhat is it that you,\nas a community,\nfeel you want and\nfeel you need?\"\nI think we're having a\nreckoning right now that,\nthat needs to be true, regardless\nof who you're studying,\nor who you're working with,\nor who you're developing for.\nFor example, if you're\ndeveloping for the\ndisability community,\nindividuals with a\ndisability you're trying to\naddress should be part of\nthe process from\nstart to finish,\nnot just answering questions\nbut probably on your\nengineering team.\nProbably they're in the room\nas you're doing development,\nas you're doing better testing,\nas you're launching\nthis into the world.\nEven if you think\nyou have the world's\nbest idea, and you're\ngoing to make this brilliant\nstartup around it,\nmake sure you've talked to\nthe people who are trying to\nhelp before you come\nup with this product.\nThat's what I try to\nteach my students,\nthat's what I'm excited\nfor us to do better,\nis to make sure those that we're\nhelping, or innovating for,\nor developing for are\njust part of the\nprocess throughout.\nThe barriers are\nsomewhat historical,\nso we all know the stories of\nthe largest tech companies\nthat are starting up.\nMaybe we don't all know about\nthe demographics of individuals\nwho get venture capital funding,\nbut I can tell you that\nthe diversity has\njust not been there.\nI don't think it's for\nmalintent necessarily,\nI think it was people have\nan idea, and they want to\ninnovate on that idea.\nPeople have been\nwilling to fund that,\nand they hit the ground,\nand run with it.\nI think part of\nthe barriers are just\nawareness, is the first one.\nIf you're not aware\nthat you should probably\nhave other people as part of\nyour team and how that can make\nyour team and your\nproduct better overall,\nthen you wouldn't think to go\nin that direction and\nyou would just hire\nyour friends who happened to\nbe people that looked\nlike you in college.\nWe've had some of that\nhistorical pressure.\nAnother part is\neconomical in that if you\nstart a startup you have\nvery few people\nin the beginning,\nand often you're not\nmaking a ton of salary\nin the beginning.\nOnly certain people from\ncertain backgrounds\ncan afford to not make a ton\nof money for a whole year.\nNow sometimes these founders\nend up making tons of\nmoney down the line,\nbut you need that\nability in the beginning\nto take that risk and\nobviously that's going to limit\nlarge swaps of our population.\nI do teach hundreds and\nthousands of students each year.\nI think that the biggest\nimpact I'll have is\nby teaching others how\nto consider the\nethical implications\nof their work throughout\ntheir entire process.\nThat doesn't just mean,\nare you allowed to\nhave these data?\nIt means, should you use these\ndata to ask that question?\nAre you protecting individuals\nin collecting the data\nand storing the data?\nAre you looking for biases\nand the results\nof your analysis?\nTeaching that throughout\nthe entire process\nbecause data is\nthe through line,\nI think that's where I'll have\nthe most important role\nin this when it comes\nto data access,\nand teaching that,\nand giving examples,\nand making sure it's a theme\nthroughout my course and\nnot just 20 minutes\nin a lecture one day.\nThat's what it looks like to me,\nis continuing to teach this and\ndemonstrate it to\nthe next-generation.\nIn my own work, I hope to have\naccess to the data\nthat I need to\nanswer the questions\nthat I'm interested in,\nbut if it's not that data that I\nshould have, I hope that\nthe other experts in\nthat field are the ones asking\nthe questions that I\nset out to ask, or I\ncollaborate with them.\nI think that secondary though\nto making sure that my students\nare thinking about this\nas they go forward\nand acting upon it.\nThis field has moved\nquickly and even if you\nthink about Google there's\nmove-quickly-break things.\nI'm excited to\nreign things back,\npull things in,\nand think deeply.\nThere is a huge field of\nAI ethics and machine\nlearning ethics.\nI'm not an ethics expert,\nand this is not necessarily\nwhere I did my\ndissertation by any means,\nbut I'm excited for\nthose voices to\ncontinue to get heard,\nand to get more exposure,\nand to be valued\ninside of companies.\nI'm painting large spinning\nbroad strokes here.\nI have prioritized this\nability to innovate,\nand embrace new technology,\nand learn more about what\nyour preferences are,\nso they can give\nyou advertisements.\nCompanies, and analysts,\nand data scientists\nhave found that fun.\nI'm excited for us to take a\nlook back, be introspective,\nand make sure that those systems\nare not harming individuals,\nnot harming certain populations.\nI would say we're\nat this crossroads\nright now where\nthose people exist,\nand they are knowledgeable,\nand they are speaking out,\nbut they are not necessarily\nbeing listened to\nas much as they should be,\nand so I'm excited for\ncompanies to embrace\nthese individuals and academics.\nThey tend to have\nacademic jobs often,\nbut for both academics\nand companies to embrace\nthis idea that we need to think\ncarefully about the products\nwe put out in the world.\nWe need to check for bias. We\nneed to make sure\nwe're not harming\ngroups or individuals\nwithin marginalized groups.\nProbably not what\nmost data scientists\nwould say they're\nmost excited about,\nbut it is what I'm\nmost excited about.\n[MUSIC]\n",
