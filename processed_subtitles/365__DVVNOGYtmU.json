Let’s get started!\nHi again! Now that you have some idea of what\nto expect from the program as a whole, let's\ndiscuss more about what you'll learn in THIS\ncourse.\nThis course will introduce you to the world\nof security and how it’s used to protect\nbusiness operations, users, and devices so\nyou can contribute to the creation of a safer\ninternet for all.\nIn this section we’ll cover foundational\nsecurity concepts.\nFirst, we’ll define security.\nThen, we’ll explore common job\nresponsibilities of security analysts.\nBuilding on that, we’ll cover core skills a\nsecurity analyst may have.\nFinally, we’ll discuss the value of security\nfor protecting organizations and people.\nLater on, we’ll cover eight security domains.\nThen, we’ll cover common security frameworks\nand controls.\nFinally, we’ll wrap up the course by\ndiscussing common tools and programming\nlanguages that entry-level security analysts\nmay use.\nComing up, we’ll go over some resources that\nwill allow you to get the most out of this\nprogram. I’m really excited for you to start\nthis journey—let’s begin!\nImagine that you’re preparing for a storm.\nYou’ve received notification that a storm is\ncoming.\nYou prepare by gathering the tools and\nmaterials you’ll need to stay safe.\nYou make sure your windows and doors are\nsecure.\nYou assemble a first aid kit, tools, food,\nand water.\nYou’re prepared! The storm hits, and there\nare powerful winds and heavy rain.\nThe storm is using its force to try and\nbreach your home.\nYou notice some water leaks and begin\npatching them quickly in order to minimize\nany risk or potential damage.\nHandling a security incident is no different.\nOrganizations must prepare for the storm by\nensuring they have the tools to mitigate and\nquickly respond to outside threats.\nThe objective is to minimize risk and\npotential damage.\nAs a security analyst, you’ll work to protect\nyour organization and the people it serves,\nfrom a variety of risks and outside threats.\nAnd if a threat does get through, you and\nyour team will provide a solution to remedy\nthe situation. To help you better understand\nwhat this means, we’ll define security and\ndiscuss the roles of security professionals\nin organizations.\nLet’s start with some definitions:\nCybersecurity, or security, is the practice\nof ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and\navailability of information by protecting\nnetworks, devices, people, and data from\nunauthorized access or criminal exploitation.\nFor example, requiring complex passwords to\naccess sites and services improves\nconfidentiality by making it much more\ndifficult for a threat actor to compromise\nthem. A threat actor is any person or group\nwho presents a security risk.\nNow that you know the definition of security,\nlet’s discuss what security teams do for an\norganization. Security protects against\nexternal and internal threats.\nAn external threat is someone outside of the\norganization trying to gain access to private\ninformation, networks, or devices.\nAn internal threat comes from current or\nformer employees, external vendors, or\ntrusted partners.\nOften these internal threats are accidental,\nsuch as an employee clicking on a compromised\nlink in an email. Other times, the internal\nactor INTENTIONALLY engages in activities\nsuch as unauthorized data access or abusing\nsystems for personal use.\nExperienced security professionals will help\norganizations mitigate - or reduce the impact\nof - threats like these.\nSecurity teams also ensure an organization\nmeets regulatory compliance, or laws and\nguidelines, that require the implementation\nof specific security standards.\nEnsuring that organizations are in compliance\nmay allow them to avoid fines and audits,\nwhile also upholding their ethical\nobligation to protect users.\nSecurity teams also maintain and improve\nbusiness productivity.\nBy establishing a plan for business\ncontinuity, security teams allow people to do\ntheir jobs even in the case of something\nlike a data breach.\nBeing security conscious can also reduce\nexpenses associated with risk, such as\nrecovering from data loss or operational\ndowntime, and potentially avoiding fines.\nThe last benefit of security that we'll\ndiscuss is maintaining brand trust.\nIf services or customer data are\ncompromised, this can lower trust in the\norganization, damage the brand, and hurt the\nbusiness in the long term.\nLoss of customer trust may also lead to less\nrevenue for the business.\nNow, let’s go over some common security-based\nroles.\nAfter completing this certificate program,\nhere are some job titles you may want to\nsearch for: Security analyst or specialist,\nCybersecurity analyst or specialist,\nSecurity operations center or SOC analyst,\nAnd Information security analyst.\nYou'll also learn more about the responsibilities\nassociated with some of these job titles\nlater in the program.\nAs you may now realize, the field of security\nincludes many topics and concepts.\nAnd every activity you complete in this\nprogram moves you one step closer to a new\njob! Let's keep learning together!\nTechnology is rapidly changing, and so are\nthe tactics and techniques that attackers\nuse. As digital infrastructure evolves,\nsecurity professionals are expected to\ncontinually grow their skills in order to\nprotect and secure sensitive information.\nIn this video, we’ll discuss some job\nresponsibilities of an entry-level security\nanalyst. So, what do security analysts do?\nSecurity analysts are responsible for\nmonitoring and protecting information and\nsystems. Now, we'll discuss three primary\nresponsibilities of a security analyst,\nstarting with protecting computer and\nnetwork systems.\nProtecting computer and network systems\nrequires an analyst to monitor an\norganization's internal network.\nIf a threat is detected, then an analyst is\ngenerally the first to respond.\nAnalysts also often take part in exercises to\nsearch for weaknesses in an organization's\nown systems. For example, a security analyst\nmay contribute to penetration testing or\nethical hacking. The goal is to penetrate -\nor hack - their own organization's internal\nnetwork to identify vulnerabilities and\nsuggest ways to strengthen their security\nmeasures. Think of it like this.\nAfter you lock your car, you check the door\nhandles to make sure no one can access any\nvaluables you keep inside.\nSecurity analysts also proactively work to\nPREVENT threats from happening in the first\nplace. One way they do this is by working\nwith information technology - or I-T - teams\nto install prevention software for the\npurposes of identifying risks and\nvulnerabilities. Analysts may also be\ninvolved in software and hardware\ndevelopment. They’ll often work with\ndevelopment teams to support product security\nby setting up appropriate processes and\nsystems to meet the organization’s data\nprotection needs. The last task we’ll\ndiscuss is conducting periodic security\naudits. A security audit is a review of an\norganization’s security records, activities,\nand other related documents.\nFor example, an analyst may examine in-house\nsecurity issues such as making sure that\nconfidential information, like individual\ncomputer passwords, isn't available to ALL\nemployees. Phew, that was a lot to cover!\nBut hopefully you have a general idea of\nwhat entry-level security analysts do on a\nday-to-day basis.\nSecurity analysts are an important part of\nany organization.\nTheir daily tasks protect small businesses,\nlarge companies, non-profit organizations,\nand government agencies.\nThey also help to ensure that the people\nserved by those organizations remain safe.\nFor any job, you need certain skills to be\nsuccessful, and many of these core skills are\ntransferable from one role to the next.\nNo matter what job you currently have, you\nlikely have many core skills already.\nHaving a diverse background enhances your\ncore skills, which means your personal\nexperiences and perspectives are especially\nvaluable!\nIn this video, we’ll discuss both\ntransferable and technical skills that are\nparticularly useful for a security analyst.\nTransferable skills are skills from other\nareas that can apply to different careers.\nTechnical skills may apply to several\nprofessions as well, however at times they\nmay require knowledge of specific tools,\nprocedures, and policies.\nLet’s discuss some core transferable skills\nyou may already have that will benefit you in\na career as a security analyst.\nCommunication is a transferable skill for a\nsecurity analyst.\nThey will often need to describe certain\nthreats, risks or vulnerabilities to people\nwho may not have a technical background.\nFor example, security analysts may be tasked\nwith interpreting and communicating policies\nand procedures to other employees.\nOr analysts may be asked to report findings\nto their supervisors, so the appropriate\nactions can be taken to secure the\norganization.\nAnother transferable skill is collaboration.\nSecurity analysts often work in teams with\nengineers, digital forensic investigators,\nand program managers.\nFor example, if you are working to roll out a\nnew security feature, you will likely have a\nproject manager, an engineer, and an ethical\nhacker on your team.\nSecurity analysts also need to be able to\nanalyze complex scenarios that they may\nencounter. For example, a security analyst\nmay need to make recommendations about how\ndifferent tools can support efficiency and\nsafeguard an organization’s internal network.\nThe last transferable skill that we'll\ndiscuss is problem solving.\nIdentifying a security problem and then\ndiagnosing it and providing solutions is a\nnecessary skill to keep business operations\nsafe.\nUnderstanding threat actors and identifying\ntrends can provide insight on how to handle\nfuture threats. Okay, now that we've covered\nsome important transferable skills, let's\ndiscuss some technical skills that security\nanalysts need to develop.\nA basic understanding of programming\nlanguages is an important skill to develop\nbecause security analysts can use\nprogramming to automate tasks and identify\nerror messages. Like learning any other\nlanguage, learning a programming language may\nseem challenging at first.\nHowever, this certificate program assumes no\nprior programming experience, so we'll start\nat the very beginning and provide several\nopportunities for hands-on practice with\nlanguages like Python and SQL!\nAnother important technical skill is knowing\nhow to use security information and event\nmanagement, or SIEM, tools.\nSecurity professionals use SIEM tools to\nidentify and analyze security threats, risks,\nand vulnerabilities.\nFor example, a SIEM tool may alert you that\nan unknown user has accessed the system.\nIn the event of an unknown user accessing\nthe system you may use computer forensics to\ninvestigate the incident.\nNow, let’s discuss computer forensics.\nSimilar to an investigator and a forensic\nscientist working in the criminal justice\nsystem, digital forensic investigators will\nattempt to identify, analyze, and preserve\ncriminal evidence within networks,\ncomputers, and electronic devices.\nKeep in mind that you may already have some\nof the core skills we’ve discussed.\nAnd if you don’t have the technical skills,\nthat’s okay!\nThis program is designed to support you in\nlearning those skills.\nFor example, over the past seven years\nworking in cybersecurity I've learned that\nsecurity analysts need to have intellectual\ncuriosity and the motivation to keep learning\nin order to succeed. Personally, I dedicate\ntime on a regular basis towards learning more\nPython and SQL skills in order to meet the\ndemands of the projects I'm working on.\nYou'll get to learn about Python and SQL\nlater in this program.\nAs you continue this journey, you’ll build\nthe knowledge and skills you need to enter\nthe security field! As we've discussed,\nsecurity professionals protect many physical\nand digital assets.\nThese skills are desired by organizations\nand government entities because risk needs to\nbe managed. Let’s continue to discuss why\nsecurity matters.\nSecurity is essential for ensuring an\norganization's business continuity and\nethical standing. There are both legal\nimplications and moral considerations to\nmaintaining an organization’s security.\nA data breach, for example, affects everyone\nthat is associated with the organization.\nThis is because data losses or leaks can\naffect an organization's reputation as well\nas the lives and reputations of their users,\nclients, and customers.\nBy maintaining strong security measures,\norganizations can increase user trust.\nThis may lead to financial growth and\nongoing business referrals.\nAs previously mentioned, organizations are\nnot the only ones that suffer during a data\nbreach. Maintaining and securing user,\ncustomer, and vendor data is an important\npart of preventing incidents that may expose\npeople’s personally identifiable information.\nPersonally identifiable information, known as\nP-I-I, is any information used to infer an\nindividual’s identity.\nPII includes someone’s full name, date of\nbirth, physical address, phone number, email\naddress, Internet Protocol, or I-P, address\nand similar information.\nSensitive personally identifiable\ninformation, known as S-P-I-I, is a specific\ntype of P-I-I that falls under stricter\nhandling guidelines and may include social\nsecurity numbers, medical or financial\ninformation, and biometric data, such as\nfacial recognition. If S-P-I-I is stolen,\nthis has the potential to be significantly\nmore damaging to an individual than if P-I-I\nis stolen.\nP-I-I and S-P-I-I data are key assets that a\nthreat actor will look for if an organization\nexperiences a breach.\nWhen a person’s identifiable information is\ncompromised, leaked, or stolen, identity\ntheft is the primary concern.\nIdentity theft is the act of stealing\npersonal information to commit fraud while\nimpersonating a victim.\nAnd the primary objective of identity theft\nis financial gain.\nWe’ve explored several reasons why security\nmatters.\nEmployers need security analysts, like you,\nto fill the current and future demand to\nprotect data, products, and people while\nensuring confidentiality, integrity, and safe\naccess to information.\nThis is why the U.S.\nBureau of Labor Statistics expects the\ndemand for security professionals to grow by\nmore than 30% by the year 2030.\nSo keep learning, and eventually you’ll be\nable to do your part to create a safer and\nmore secure environment for organizations\nand people alike!\nCongratulations on completing the first\nsection of this course!\nLet’s quickly review what we’ve covered so\nfar, before moving on.\nWe defined security and introduced the\nbenefits of implementing security in an\norganization. Then, we discussed different\njob responsibilities, such as managing\nthreats and installing prevention software.\nWe also introduced some important core\nskills, like collaboration and computer\nforensics. We finished by discussing the\nvalue of security and how it supports\ncritical business functions.\nI hope you've gained a greater understanding\nof security.\nIf you feel like you need a refresher before\nmoving on, you can always go back and review\nany content you’re unsure about.\nBy learning the basics, you’re laying the\nfoundation for the rest of your security\ncareer. Coming up, we'll explore some\nwell-known attacks that shaped the security\nindustry. I'm excited to continue this\njourney with you!\nWelcome back! When it comes to security,\nthere is so much to learn, and I'm thrilled\nto be part of your career journey.\nThis is such an exciting time to be learning\nabout security!\nWhen I learned about international hacks\nthat impacted both private companies and\ngovernment organizations, I was inspired to\nwant to work in security because I realized\nhow dynamic and important this field is.\nOne reason there are so many jobs in the\nsecurity field today is because of attacks\nthat happened in the 1980s and 1990s.\nDecades later, security professionals are\nstill actively working to protect\norganizations and people from variations of\nthese early computer attacks.\nIn this section of the course, we’ll discuss\nviruses and malware, and introduce the\nconcept of social engineering.\nThen, we'll discuss how the digital age\nushered in a new era of threat actors.\nKnowing the evolution of each attack is key\nto protecting against future attacks.\nLastly, we’ll provide an overview of eight\nsecurity domains.\nI hope you are as eager as I am to learn\nmore!\nNext up, we’ll travel back in time to explore\nsome of the viruses, data breaches, and\nmalware attacks that have helped shape the\nindustry as we know it today.\nThe security industry is constantly evolving,\nbut many present-day attacks are not entirely\nnew. Attackers often alter or enhance\nprevious methods.\nUnderstanding past attacks can provide\ndirection for how to handle or investigate\nincidents in your job as a security analyst.\nFirst, let’s go over a couple of key terms\nthat will support your understanding of the\nattacks we’ll discuss.\nA computer virus is malicious code written to\ninterfere with computer operations and cause\ndamage to data and software.\nThe virus attaches itself to programs, or\ndocuments, on a computer.\nThen spreads and infects one or more\ncomputers in a network.\nA worm is a type of computer virus that can\nduplicate and spread on its own without human\ninvolvement. Today, viruses are more\ncommonly referred to as malware, which is\nsoftware designed to harm devices or\nnetworks.\nTwo examples of early malware attacks that\nwe’ll cover are the Brain virus and the\nMorris worm. They were created by malware\ndevelopers to accomplish specific tasks.\nHowever, the developers underestimated the\nimpact their malware would have and the\namount of “infected” computers there would\nbe.\nLet’s take a closer look at these attacks and\ndiscuss how they helped shape security as we\nknow it today. In 1986, the Alvi brothers\ncreated the Brain virus.\nAlthough the intention of the virus was to\ntrack illegal copies of medical software and\nprevent pirated licenses, what the virus\nactually did was unexpected.\nOnce a person used a pirated copy of the\nsoftware, the virus infected that computer.\nThen, any disk that was inserted into the\ncomputer was also infected.\nThe virus spread to a new computer every\ntime someone used one of the infected disks.\nUndetected, the virus spread globally within\na couple of months.\nAlthough the intention was not to destroy\ndata or hardware, the virus slowed down\nproductivity and significantly impacted\nbusiness operations.\nThe Brain virus fundamentally altered the\ncomputing industry, emphasizing the need for\na plan to maintain security and\nproductivity.\nAs a security analyst, you will follow and\nmaintain strategies put in place to ensure\nyour organization has a plan to keep their\ndata and people safe.\nAnother influential computer attack was the\nMorris worm.\nIn 1988, Robert Morris developed a program\nto assess the size of the internet.\nThe program crawled the web and installed\nitself onto other computers to tally the\nnumber of computers that were connected to\nthe internet.\nSounds simple, right?\nThe program, however, failed to keep track of\nthe computers it had already compromised and\ncontinued to reinstall itself, until the\ncomputers ran out of memory and crashed.\nAbout 6,000 computers were affected,\nrepresenting 10% of the internet at the time.\nThis attack cost millions of dollars in\ndamages, due to business disruptions and the\nefforts required to remove the worm.\nAfter the Morris worm, Computer Emergency\nResponse Teams, known as CERTs®, were\nestablished to respond to computer security\nincidents.\nCERTs® still exists today, but their place\nin the security industry has expanded to\ninclude more responsibilities.\nLater in this program you'll learn more about\nthe core functions of these security teams\nand gain hands-on practice with detection\nand response tools.\nEarly attacks played a key role in shaping\nthe current security industry.\nAnd coming up, we’ll discuss how attacks\nevolved in the digital age!\nWith the expansion of reliable high-speed\ninternet, the number of computers connected\nto the internet increased dramatically.\nBecause malware could spread through the\ninternet, threat actors no longer needed to\nuse physical disks to spread viruses.\nTo better understand attacks in the digital\nage, we’ll discuss two notable attacks that\nrelied on the internet: The LoveLetter\nattack and the Equifax breach.\nIn the year 2000, Onel de Guzman created the\nLoveLetter malware to steal internet login\ncredentials. This attack spread rapidly and\ntook advantage of people who had not\ndeveloped a healthy suspicion for\nunsolicited emails.\nUsers received an email with the subject line\n“I Love You.” Each email contained an\nattachment labeled, “Love Letter For You.”\nWhen the attachment was opened, the malware\nscanned a user’s address book.\nThen, it automatically sent itself to each\nperson on the list and installed a program to\ncollect user information and passwords.\nRecipients would think they were receiving an\nemail from a friend, but it was actually\nmalware. The LoveLetter ended up infecting\n45 million computers globally and is believed\nto have caused over $10 billion in damages.\nThe LoveLetter attack is the first example of\nsocial engineering.\nSocial engineering is a manipulation\ntechnique that exploits human error to gain\nprivate information, access, or valuables.\nAfter the LoveLetter, attackers understood\nthe power of social engineering.\nThe number of social engineering attacks is\nincreasing with every new social media\napplication that allows public access to\npeople's data.\nMany people are now prioritizing convenience\nover privacy.\nThe trade off of this evolving shift is that\nthese tools may lead to increased\nvulnerability, if people do not use them\nappropriately.\nAs a security professional, your role is to\nidentify and manage inappropriate use of\ntechnology that may place your organization\nand all the people associated with it at\nrisk. One way to safeguard your organization\nis to conduct regular internal trainings,\nwhich you as a future security analyst may\nbe asked to lead or participate in.\nToday, it’s common for employees to receive\ntraining on how to identify social\nengineering attacks.\nSpecifically, phishing through the emails\nthey receive.\nPhishing is the use of digital\ncommunications to trick people into revealing\nsensitive data or deploying malicious\nsoftware.\nNow let's discuss the Equifax breach.\nIn 2017, attackers successfully infiltrated\nthe credit reporting agency, Equifax.\nThis resulted in one of the largest known\ndata breaches of sensitive information.\nOver 143 million customer records were\nstolen, and the breach affected approximately\n40% of all Americans.\nThe records included personally identifiable\ninformation, including social security\nnumbers, birth dates, driver’s license\nnumbers, home addresses and credit card\nnumbers. From a security standpoint, the\nbreach occurred due to multiple failures on\nEquifax's part. It wasn’t just one\nvulnerability that the attackers took\nadvantage of, there were several.\nThe company failed to take the actions\nneeded to fix multiple known vulnerabilities\nin the months leading up to the data breach.\nIn the end, Equifax settled with the U.S.\ngovernment and paid over $575 million to\nresolve customer complaints and cover\nrequired fines.\nWhile there have been other data breaches\nbefore and after the Equifax breach, the\nlarge settlement with the U.S.\ngovernment alerted companies to the\nfinancial impact of a breach and the need to\nimplement preventative measures.\nThese are just a couple of well-known\nincidents that have shaped the security\nindustry. Knowing about them will help you\nin your security career.\nUnderstanding different types of malware and\nsocial engineering attacks will allow you to\ncommunicate about security risks during\nfuture job interviews.\nAs a future security professional, constantly\nadapting and educating yourself on threat\nactors’ tactics and techniques will be a\npart of your job.\nBy noticing similar trends, patterns, and\nmethodologies, you may be able to identify a\npotential breach and limit future damage.\nFinally, understanding how security affects\npeople's lives is a good reminder of why the\nwork you will do is so important!\nAs the tactics of threat actors evolve, so do\nthe roles of security professionals.\nHaving a solid understanding of core\nsecurity concepts will support your growth in\nthis field. One way to better understand\nthese core concepts is by organizing them\ninto categories, called security domains.\nAs of 2022, C-I-S-S-P has defined eight\ndomains to organize the work of security\nprofessionals. It’s important to understand\nthat these domains are related and that gaps\nin one domain can result in negative\nconsequences to an entire organization.\nIt’s also important to understand the domains\nbecause it may help you better understand\nyour career goals and your role within an\norganization.\nAs you learn more about the elements of each\ndomain, the work involved in one may appeal\nto you more than the others.\nThis domain may become a career path for you\nto explore further.\nC-I-S-S-P defines eight domains in total, and\nwe'll discuss all eight between this video\nand the next. In this video, we’re going to\ncover the first four: Security and risk\nmanagement, asset security, security\narchitecture and engineering, and\ncommunication and network engineering.\nLet’s start with the first domain.\nSecurity and risk management focuses on\ndefining security goals and objectives, risk\nmitigation, compliance, business continuity,\nand the law.\nFor example, security analysts may need to\nupdate company policies related to private\nhealth information if a change is made to a\nfederal compliance regulation such as the\nHealth Insurance Portability and\nAccountability Act - also known as HIPPA.\nThe second domain is asset security.\nThis domain focuses on securing digital and\nphysical assets.\nIt’s also related to the storage,\nmaintenance, retention, and destruction of\ndata. When working with this domain,\nsecurity analysts may be tasked with making\nsure that old equipment is properly disposed\nof and destroyed, including any type of\nconfidential information.\nThe third domain is security architecture and\nengineering.\nThis domain focuses on optimizing data\nsecurity by ensuring effective tools,\nsystems, and processes are in place.\nAs a security analyst, you may be tasked with\nconfiguring a firewall.\nA firewall is a device used to monitor and\nfilter incoming and outgoing computer network\ntraffic. Setting up a firewall correctly\nhelps prevent attacks that could affect\nproductivity. The fourth security domain is\ncommunication and network engineering.\nThis domain focuses on managing and securing\nphysical networks and wireless\ncommunications. As a security analyst, you\nmay be asked to analyze user behavior within\nyour organization. Imagine discovering that\nusers are connecting to unsecured wireless\nhotspots. This could leave the organization\nand its employees vulnerable to attacks.\nTo ensure communications are secure, you\nwould create a network policy to prevent and\nmitigate exposure. Maintaining an\norganization’s security is a team effort, and\nthere are many moving parts.\nAs an entry-level analyst, you will continue\nto develop your skills by learning how to\nmitigate risks, to keep people and data\nsafe.\nYou don’t need to be an expert in all\ndomains.\nBut, having a basic understanding of them\nwill aid you in your journey as a security\nprofessional. You’re doing great!\nWe have just introduced the first four\nsecurity domains, and in the next video we’ll\ndiscuss four more! See you soon!\nWelcome back. In the last video we introduced\nyou to the first four security domains.\nIn this video, we’ll introduce you to the\nnext four security domains: identity and\naccess management, security assessment and\ntesting, security operations, and software\ndevelopment security.\nFamiliarizing yourself with these domains\nwill allow you to navigate the complex world\nof security. The domains outline and\norganize how a team of security professionals\nwork together. Depending on the\norganization, analyst roles may sit at the\nintersection of multiple domains or focus on\none specific domain.\nKnowing where a particular role fits within\nthe security landscape will help you prepare\nfor job interviews and work as part of a\nfull security team.\nLet’s move into the fifth domain.\nIdentity and access management focuses on\nkeeping data secure, by ensuring users follow\nestablished policies to control and manage\nphysical assets, like office spaces, and\nlogical assets, such as networks and\napplications.\nValidating the identities of employees and\ndocumenting access roles are essential to\nmaintaining the organization’s physical and\ndigital security.\nFor example, as a security analyst, you may\nbe tasked with setting up employees'\nkeycard-access to buildings.\nThe sixth domain is security assessment and\ntesting.\nThis domain focuses on conducting security\ncontrol testing, collecting and analyzing\ndata, and conducting security audits to\nmonitor for risks, threats, and\nvulnerabilities. Security analysts may\nconduct regular audits of user permissions,\nto make sure that users have the correct\nlevel of access.\nFor example, access to payroll information\nis often limited to certain employees, so\nanalysts may be asked to regularly audit\npermissions to ensure that no unauthorized\nperson can view employee salaries.\nThe seventh domain is security operations.\nThis domain focuses on conducting\ninvestigations and implementing preventative\nmeasures. Imagine that you, as a security\nanalyst, receive an alert that an unknown\ndevice has been connected to your internal\nnetwork.\nYou would need to follow the organization's\npolicies and procedures to quickly stop the\npotential threat. The final, eighth domain\nis software development security.\nThis domain focuses on using secure coding\npractices - which are a set of recommended\nguidelines that are used to create secure\napplications and services.\nA security analyst may work with software\ndevelopment teams to ensure security\npractices are incorporated into the software\ndevelopment lifecycle.\nIf, for example, one of your partner teams\nis creating a new mobile app, then you may be\nasked to advise on the password policies or\nensure that any user data is properly secured\nand managed. That ends our introduction to\nC-I-S-S-P’s eight security domains.\nChallenge yourself to better understand each\nof these domains and how they affect the\noverall security of an organization.\nWhile they may still be a bit unclear to you\nthis early in the program, these domains will\nbe discussed in greater detail in the next\ncourse.\nSee you there! This concludes our brief\nintroduction to some of the most influential\nsecurity attacks throughout history and\nC-I-S-S-P’s eight security domains!\nLet’s review what we’ve discussed.\nFirst we covered viruses, including the Brain\nvirus and the Morris worm, and discussed how\nthese early forms of malware shaped the\nsecurity industry.\nWe also discussed how many attacks today are\nvariants of these early examples.\nUnderstanding previous attacks is critical\nfor security professionals who are working to\nprotect organizations and people from\npossible future variants.\nWe also discussed social engineering and\nthreat actor motives by learning about the\nLoveLetter attack and the Equifax data\nbreach.\nThese incidents showed the widespread impacts\nand associated costs of more recent security\nbreaches in the digital age.\nFinally, we introduced C-I-S-S-P’s eight\nsecurity domains and how they can be used to\ncategorize different areas of focus within\nthe security profession.\nI hope you are feeling confident about your\nfoundational security knowledge!\nLearning the history of security can allow\nyou to better understand the current\nindustry. C-I-S-S-P’s eight security domains\nprovide a way to organize the work of\nsecurity professionals.\nRemember, every security professional is\nessential.\nYour unique point of view, professional\nbackground, and knowledge are valuable.\nSo, the diversity you bring to the field\nwill further improve the security industry as\nyou work to keep organizations and people\nsafe.\nHi there—glad to have you back!\nYou’re half way done with the first course,\nso you’re making great progress.\nIn this section, we’ll discuss how\norganizations protect themselves from\nthreats, risks, and vulnerabilities by\ncovering key principles such as: frameworks,\ncontrols, and ethics.\nTo help you better understand how this\nrelates to the role of a security analyst,\nwe’ll use an analogy.\nImagine you want to plant a garden.\nYou research, plan, prepare and purchase\nmaterials while considering all the things\nthat could potentially present a risk to\nyour garden.\nYou establish a plan to pull weeds, spray for\nbugs, and water your plants regularly to\nprevent issues or incidents.\nBut as the days go by, unexpected problems\narise.\nThe weather has been unpredictable, and\npests have been aggressively trying to\ninfiltrate your garden. You start\nimplementing better ways to safeguard your\ngarden by installing a surveillance camera,\nbuilding a fence, and covering your plants\nwith a canopy to keep your garden healthy\nand growing.\nNow that you have a better idea about the\nthreats to your garden and how to keep your\nplants safe, you establish better policies\nand procedures to continuously monitor and\nsafeguard your garden.\nIn this way, security resembles a garden.\nIt’s an evolving industry that will\nchallenge you to make continuous improvements\nto policies and procedures that help protect\nyour organization and the people it serves.\nTo that end, we’ll introduce security\nframeworks and controls and explain why\nthey’re important. We’ll also cover core\ncomponents and specific examples of\nframeworks and controls, including the\nConfidentiality, Integrity, and Availability\nTriad, or C-I-A Triad.\nWe’ll end with a discussion about the ethics\nof security, and share a few notable ethical\nconcerns in the security field.\nEvolving security practices may seem a little\nabstract, but many of us use them every day.\nFor example, I use security keys, which are a\ntype of security control, as a second form of\nauthentication to access my accounts.\nThe keys ensure that only I can access my\naccounts, even if a password has been\ncompromised. By improving confidentiality,\nthey also assure me that the integrity of my\naccounts is intact.\nHaving processes and procedures in place to\norganize security efforts and make informed\ndecisions is important for any organization.\nI’m so excited to get started—and I hope you\nare too!\nImagine you’re working as a security analyst\nand receive multiple alerts about suspicious\nactivity on the network.\nYou realize that you’ll need to implement\nadditional security measures to keep these\nalerts from becoming serious incidents.\nBut where do you start? As an analyst,\nyou’ll start by identifying your\norganization’s critical assets and risks.\nThen, you’ll implement the necessary\nframeworks and controls.\nIn this video, we’ll discuss how security\nprofessionals use frameworks to continuously\nidentify and manage risk.\nWe'll also cover how to use security\ncontrols to manage or reduce specific risks.\nSecurity frameworks are guidelines used for\nbuilding plans to help mitigate risk and\nthreats to data and privacy.\nSecurity frameworks provide a structured\napproach to implementing a security\nlifecycle. The security lifecycle is a\nconstantly evolving set of policies and\nstandards that define how an organization\nmanages risks, follows established\nguidelines, and meets regulatory compliance\n- or laws.\nThere are several security frameworks that\nmay be used to manage different types of\norganizational and regulatory compliance\nrisks.\nThe purpose of security frameworks includes\nprotecting personally identifiable\ninformation - known as P-I-I - securing\nfinancial information, identifying security\nweaknesses, managing organizational risks,\nand aligning security with business goals.\nFrameworks have four core components and\nunderstanding them will allow you to better\nmanage potential risks.\nThe first core component is identifying and\ndocumenting security goals.\nFor example, an organization may have a goal\nto align with the E.U.'s General Data\nProtection Regulation law, also known as\nG-D-P-R.\nG-D-P-R is a data protection law established\nto grant European citizens more control over\ntheir personal data. A security analyst may\nbe asked to identify and document areas where\nan organization is out of compliance with\nG-D-P-R.\nThe second core component is setting\nguidelines to achieve security goals.\nFor example, when implementing guidelines to\nachieve G-D-P-R compliance, your organization\nmay need to develop new policies for how to\nhandle data requests from individual users.\nThe third core component of security\nframeworks is implementing strong security\nprocesses. In the case of G-D-P-R, a\nsecurity analyst working for a social media\ncompany may help design procedures to ensure\nthe organization complies with verified user\ndata requests.\nAn example of this type of request is when a\nuser attempts to update or delete their\nprofile information.\nThe last core component of security\nframeworks is monitoring and communicating\nresults. As an example, you may monitor your\norganization's internal network, and report a\npotential security issue affecting G-D-P-R\nto your manager or regulatory compliance\nofficer. Now that we’ve introduced the four\ncore components of security frameworks, let’s\ntie them all together. Frameworks allow\nanalysts to work alongside other members of a\nsecurity team to document, implement, and\nuse the policies and procedures that have\nbeen created. It’s essential for an\nentry-level analyst to understand this\nprocess because it directly affects the work\nthey do and how they collaborate with others.\nNext, we’ll discuss security controls.\nSecurity Controls are safeguards designed to\nreduce SPECIFIC security risks.\nFor example, your company may have a\nguideline that requires all employees to\ncomplete a privacy training to reduce the\nrisk of data breaches.\nAs a security analyst, you may use a\nsoftware tool to automatically assign and\ntrack which employees have completed this\ntraining.\nSecurity frameworks and controls are vital to\nmanaging security for all types of\norganizations and ensuring that everyone is\ndoing their part to maintain a low level of\nrisk. Understanding their purpose and how\nthey are used allows analysts to support an\norganization’s security goals and protect\nthe people it serves.\nIn the following videos, we’ll discuss some\nwell-known frameworks and principles that\nanalysts need to be aware of to minimize\nrisk, and protect data and users.\nHi, welcome back!\nPreviously, we discussed frameworks and\ncontrols in general.\nIn this video, you'll learn about SPECIFIC\nframeworks and controls that organizations\ncan voluntarily use to minimize risks to\ntheir data and to protect users.\nLet’s get started! The C-I-A triad is a\nfoundational model that helps inform how\norganizations consider risk when setting up\nsystems and security policies.\nC-I-A stands for confidentiality, integrity,\nand availability.\nConfidentiality means that only authorized\nusers can access specific assets or data.\nFor example, strict access controls that\ndefine who should and should not have access\nto data must be put in place to ensure\nconfidential data remains safe.\nIntegrity means the data is correct,\nauthentic, and reliable.\nTo maintain integrity, security professionals\ncan use a form of data protection like\nencryption to safeguard data from being\ntampered with.\nAvailability means data is accessible to\nthose who are authorized to access it.\nAs an example, a director may have more\naccess to certain data than a department\nmanager because directors usually oversee\nmore employees.\nLet’s define a term that came up during our\ndiscussion of the C-I-A triad: asset.\nAn asset is an item perceived as having value\nto an organization.\nAnd value is determined by the cost\nassociated with the asset in question.\nFor example, an application that stores\nsensitive data, such as social security\nnumbers or bank accounts, is a valuable\nasset to an organization.\nIt carries more risk and therefore requires\ntighter security controls in comparison to a\nwebsite that shares publicly available news\ncontent.\nAs you may remember, earlier in the course we\ndiscussed frameworks and controls in general.\nNow, we’ll discuss a specific framework\ndeveloped by the U.S.-based National\nInstitute of Standards and Technology: the\nCybersecurity Framework, also referred to as\nthe NIST C-S-F.\nThe NIST Cybersecurity Framework is a\nvoluntary framework that consists of\nstandards, guidelines, and best practices to\nmanage cybersecurity risk.\nIt’s important to become familiar with this\nframework because security teams use it as a\nbaseline to manage short and long-term risk.\nManaging and mitigating risks AND protecting\nan organization's assets from threat actors\nare key goals for security professionals.\nUnderstanding the different motives a threat\nactor may have, alongside identifying your\norganization’s most valuable assets is\nimportant.\nSome of the most dangerous threat actors to\nconsider are disgruntled employees.\nThey’re the MOST dangerous because they\noften have access to sensitive information\nand know where to find it.\nIn order to reduce this type of risk,\nsecurity professionals would use the\nprinciple of availability, as well as\norganizational guidelines based on\nframeworks, to ensure staff members can only\naccess the data they need to perform their\njobs. Threat actors originate from all\nacross the globe, and a diverse workforce of\nsecurity professionals helps organizations\nidentify attackers' intentions.\nA variety of perspectives can assist\norganizations in understanding and mitigating\nthe impact of malicious activity.\nThat concludes our introduction to the CIA\ntriad and NIST CSF framework, which are used\nto develop processes to secure organizations\nand the people they serve!\nYou may be asked in an interview if you know\nabout security frameworks and principles.\nOr you may be asked to explain how they’re\nused to secure organizational assets.\nIn either case, throughout this program\nyou’ll have multiple opportunities to learn\nmore about them and apply what we’ve\ndiscussed to real-world situations.\nComing up, we’ll discuss the ethics of\nsecurity.\nSee you soon! In security, new technologies\npresent new challenges.\nFor every new security incident or risk, the\nright or wrong decision isn’t always clear.\nFor example, imagine that you’re working as\nan entry-level security analyst and you have\nreceived a high risk alert.\nYou investigate the alert and discover data\nhas been transferred without authorization.\nYou work diligently to identify who made the\ntransfer and discover it is one of your\nfriends from work. What do you do?\nEthically, as a security professional your\njob is to remain unbiased and maintain\nsecurity and confidentiality.\nWhile it’s normal to want to protect a\nfriend, regardless of who the user in\nquestion may be, your responsibility and\nobligation is to adhere to the policies and\nprotocols you’ve been trained to follow.\nIn many cases, security teams are entrusted\nwith greater access to data and information\nthan other employees.\nSecurity professionals must respect that\nprivilege and act ethically at all times.\nSecurity ethics are guidelines for making\nappropriate decisions as a security\nprofessional. As another example, if you as\nan analyst have the ability to grant yourself\naccess to payroll data and can give yourself\na raise, just because you have access to do\nso, does that mean you should?\nThe answer is no. You should never abuse the\naccess you’ve been granted and entrusted\nwith. Let’s discuss ethical principles that\nmay raise questions as you navigate solutions\nfor mitigating risks.\nThese are confidentiality, privacy\nprotections, and laws.\nLet’s begin with the first ethical principle,\nconfidentiality.\nEarlier we discussed confidentiality as part\nof the C-I-A triad; now let's discuss how\nconfidentiality can be applied to ethics.\nAs a security professional, you’ll encounter\nproprietary or private information, such as\nP-I-I. It’s your ethical duty to keep that\ninformation confidential and safe.\nFor example, you may want to help out a\ncoworker by providing computer system access\noutside of properly documented channels.\nHowever, this ethical violation can result\nin serious consequences including reprimands,\nthe loss of your professional reputation,\nand legal repercussions for both you and your\nfriend. The second ethical principle to\nconsider is privacy protections.\nPrivacy protection means safeguarding\npersonal information from unauthorized use.\nFor example, imagine you receive a personal\nemail after hours from your manager\nrequesting a colleague’s home phone number.\nYour manager explains that they can’t access\nthe employee database at the moment, but they\nneed to discuss an urgent matter with that\nperson.\nAs a security analyst, your role is to follow\nthe policies and procedures of your company,\nwhich in this example, state that employee\ninformation is stored in a secure database\nand should NEVER be accessed or shared in\nany other format.\nSo, accessing and sharing the employee’s\npersonal information would be unethical.\nIn situations like this, it can be difficult\nto know what to do.\nSo, the best response is to adhere to the\npolicies and procedures set by your\norganization. A third important ethical\nprinciple we must discuss is the law.\nLaws are rules that are recognized by a\ncommunity and enforced by a governing entity.\nFor example, consider a staff member at a\nhospital who has been trained to handle\nP-I-I, and S-P-I-I for compliance.\nThe staff member has files with confidential\ndata that should never be left unsupervised,\nbut the staff member is late for a meeting.\nInstead of locking the files in a designated\narea, the files are left on the staff\nmember’s desk, unsupervised.\nUpon the employee’s return, the files are\nmissing.\nThe staff member has just violated multiple\ncompliance regulations, and their actions\nwere unethical and illegal since their\nnegligence has likely resulted in the loss of\nprivate patient and hospital data.\nAs you enter the security field, remember\nthat technology is constantly evolving and so\nare attacker's tactics and techniques.\nBecause of this, security professionals must\ncontinue to think critically about how to\nrespond to attacks.\nHaving a strong sense of ethics can guide\nyour decisions to ensure that the proper\nprocesses and procedures are followed to\nmitigate these continually evolving risks.\nYou are now better prepared to understand and\nhelp make decisions regarding assessing and\nmanaging risk. Let’s review what we’ve\ncovered.\nWe discussed security frameworks and controls\nand how they’re used to develop processes and\nprocedures that protect organizations and\nthe people they serve.\nWe also discussed core components of\nframeworks, such as identifying security\ngoals and establishing guidelines to achieve\nthose goals.\nThen, we introduced specific frameworks and\ncontrols, including the C-I-A triad and the\nNIST C-S-F, and how they are used to manage\nrisk.\nAnd finally, we discussed security ethics,\nincluding common ethical issues to consider,\nsuch as confidentiality, privacy\nprotections, and laws.\nYou’re almost there, only one more section to\ngo in this course!\nComing up, you’ll learn about common tools\nand programming languages used by security\nanalysts to protect organizational\noperations.\nHope you’re as excited as I am to keep going!\nWelcome to the final section of this course!\nHere, we’ll be introducing tools and\nprogramming languages that are commonly used\nin the security field.\nThey are essential for monitoring security\nin an organization because they enhance\nefficiency by automating tasks.\nAlthough we’re only introducing these\nconcepts and tools at this point, later in\nthe program you’ll have opportunities to use\nthem in a variety of hands-on activities.\nIn the following videos, you’ll learn about\nsecurity incident and event management, or\nSIEM, tools.\nYou’ll also be introduced to other tools\nsuch as playbooks and network protocol\nanalyzers. Then, you’ll learn about the\nLinux operating system and security related\ntasks that are initiated through programming\nlanguages such as SQL, and Python.\nFor me, SQL is one of the most useful tools.\nIt allows me to explore all the different\ndata sources we collect, and it allows my\nteam to analyze the data for trends.\nTake your time going through the videos and\nif you need to, rewatch them.\nAlso know that these tools will be discussed\nin much more detail, and you will be able to\npractice them firsthand, later in the\ncertificate program.\nWhile every organization has their own set of\ntools and training materials that you’ll\nlearn to use on the job, this program will\nprovide you with foundational knowledge that\nwill help you succeed in the security\nindustry.\nLet’s get started! As mentioned earlier,\nsecurity is like preparing for a storm.\nIf you identify a leak, the color or shape\nof the bucket you use to catch the water\ndoesn’t matter. What IS important is\nmitigating the risks and threats to your\nhome, by using the tools available to you.\nAs an entry-level security analyst, you’ll\nhave a lot of tools in your toolkit that you\ncan use to mitigate potential risks.\nIn this video, we'll discuss the primary\npurposes and functions of some commonly used\nsecurity tools. And later in the program,\nyou’ll have hands-on opportunities to\npractice using them. Before discussing tools\nfurther, let's briefly discuss logs, which\nare the source of data that the tools we’ll\ncover are designed to organize.\nA log is a record of events that occur within\nan organization’s systems.\nExamples of security related logs include\nrecords of employees signing into their\ncomputers or accessing web-based services.\nLogs help security professionals identify\nvulnerabilities and potential security\nbreaches. The first tools we’ll discuss are\nSecurity Information and Event Management\ntools, or SIEM tools.\nA SIEM tool is an application that collects\nand analyzes log data to monitor critical\nactivities in an organization.\nThe acronym S-I-E-M may be pronounced as sim\nor seem, but we'll use sim throughout this\nprogram. SIEM tools collect real-time - or\ninstant - information and allow security\nanalysts to identify potential breaches as\nthey happen.\nImagine having to read pages and pages of\nlogs to determine if there are any security\nthreats. Depending on the amount of data, it\ncould take hours or days.\nSIEM tools reduce the amount of data an\nanalyst must review by providing alerts for\nspecific types of risks and threats.\nNext, let’s go over examples of commonly used\nSIEM tools: Splunk and Chronicle.\nSplunk is a data analysis platform, and\nSplunk Enterprise provides SIEM solutions.\nSplunk Enterprise is a self-hosted tool used\nto retain, analyze, and search an\norganization's log data.\nAnother SIEM tool is Google’s Chronicle.\nChronicle is a cloud-native SIEM tool that\nstores security data for search and analysis.\nCloud-native means that Chronicle allows for\nfast delivery of new features.\nBoth of these SIEM tools, and SIEMs in\ngeneral, collect data from multiple places,\nthen analyze and filter that data to allow\nsecurity teams to prevent and quickly react\nto potential security threats.\nAs a security analyst, you may find yourself\nusing SIEM tools to analyze filtered events\nand patterns, perform incident analysis, or\nproactively search for threats.\nDepending on your organization's SIEM setup\nand risk focus, the tools and how they\nfunction may differ, but ultimately they are\nALL used to mitigate risk.\nOther key tools that you will use in your\nrole as a security analyst - AND that you’ll\nhave hands-on opportunities to use later in\nthe program - are playbooks and network\nprotocol analyzers.\nA playbook is a manual that provides details\nabout any operational action, such as how to\nrespond to an incident.\nPlaybooks, which vary from one organization\nto the next, guide analysts in how to handle\na security incident before, during, and\nafter it has occurred.\nPlaybooks can pertain to security or\ncompliance reviews, access management, and\nmany other organizational tasks that require\na documented process from beginning to end.\nAnother tool you may use as a security\nanalyst is a network protocol analyzer, also\ncalled packet sniffer.\nA packet sniffer is a tool designed to\ncapture and analyze data traffic within a\nnetwork. Common network protocol analyzers\ninclude t-c-p-dump and Wireshark.\nAs an entry-level analyst, you don’t have to\nbe an expert in these tools.\nAs you continue through this certificate\nprogram and get more hands-on practice,\nyou’ll continuously build your understanding\nof how to use these tools to identify,\nassess, and mitigate risks.\nAs we discussed previously, organizations use\na variety of tools - such as SIEMs,\nplaybooks, and packet sniffers - to better\nmanage, monitor, and analyze security\nthreats. But those aren’t the only tools in\nan analyst’s tool kit.\nAnalysts also use programming languages and\noperating systems to accomplish essential\ntasks. In this video, we’ll introduce you to\nPython and SQL programming, and the Linux\noperating system. All of which you’ll have\nan opportunity to practice using later in the\ncertificate program. Organizations can use\nprogramming to create a specific set of\ninstructions for a computer to execute\ntasks.\nProgramming allows analysts to complete\nrepetitive tasks and processes with a high\ndegree of accuracy and efficiency.\nIt also helps reduce the risk of human\nerror, and can save hours or days compared to\nperforming the work manually.\nNow that you’re aware of what programming\nlanguages are used for, let’s discuss a\nspecific and related operating system called\nLinux, and two programming languages: SQL and\nPython. Linux is an open-source - or\npublicly available - operating system.\nUnlike other operating systems you may be\nfamiliar with, for example macOS or Windows,\nLinux relies on a command line as the\nprimary user interface.\nLinux itself is not a programming language,\nbut it does allow for the use of text-based\ncommands between the user and the operating\nsystem.\nYou’ll learn more about Linux later in the\nprogram.\nA common use of Linux for entry-level\nsecurity analysts is examining logs to better\nunderstand what’s occurring in a system.\nFor example, you might find yourself using\ncommands to review an error log when\ninvestigating uncommonly high network\ntraffic.\nNext, let’s discuss SQL.\nS-Q-L stands for structured query language.\nSQL is a programming language used to create,\ninteract with, and request information from a\ndatabase. A database is an organized\ncollection of information or data.\nThere may be millions of data points in a\ndatabase.\nSo an entry-level security analyst would use\nSQL to filter through the data points to\nretrieve specific information.\nThe last programming language we’ll introduce\nis Python.\nSecurity professionals can use Python to\nperform tasks that are repetitive and\ntime-consuming, and that require a high\nlevel of detail and accuracy.\nAs a future analyst, it's important to\nunderstand that every organization's tool kit\nmay be somewhat different, based on their\nsecurity needs.\nThe main point is that you're familiar with\nsome industry standard tools because that\nwill show employers that you have the\nability to learn how to use THEIR tools to\nprotect the organization and the people it\nserves.\nYou're doing great! Later in the course\nyou'll learn more about Linux and programming\nlanguages, and you'll practice using these\ntools in security-related scenarios.\nThat completes the introduction to security\ntools and programming languages!\nIn this section of the course, we covered\nSIEM tools such as Splunk and Chronicle.\nWe also discussed how SIEM tools are used by\nsecurity analysts to complete different\ntasks. Then, we discussed other tools such\nas playbooks and network protocol analyzers,\nalso called packet sniffers.\nFinally, we introduced the Linux operating\nsystem and the programming languages SQL and\nPython. Remember, the tools we discussed\ntake time to understand completely.\nBut having a basic understanding of these\ntools can help you get a job in the security\nfield and progress in your career!\nCongratulations on completing the first\ncourse!\nWe’ve come so far and covered so much about\na really exciting industry.\nI find cybersecurity to be exciting because\nit's dynamic, there are always new puzzles to\nsolve, and the work of protecting our users\nis worthwhile.\nBefore we move on, let’s take a moment to\ncelebrate and reflect on what we’ve covered:\nFirst, we introduced core security concepts,\nincluding what security is and why it\nmatters. We also discussed what an\nentry-level security analyst does, and some\nskills related to the role.\nThen, we transitioned to eight security\ndomains, which include security and risk\nmanagement, asset security, and security\noperations.\nNext, we highlighted security frameworks and\ncontrols.\nSpecifically, the CIA triad model and the\nNIST Cybersecurity Framework.\nFinally, we explored common tools and\nprogramming languages used by security\nanalysts, such as SIEMs, playbooks, SQL, and\nPython.\nI hope you’re proud of the work you’ve done\nso far.\nNo matter what direction you take in the\nsecurity industry, everything you’ve learned\nlays the foundation for the next phase of\nyour career.\nAnd, as you move through this program,\nyou’ll have the chance to develop your skills\nfurther. In the next course, my colleague\nwill provide more details about several of\nthe topics introduced in this course.\nHi! I'm Ashley and I will be guiding you\nthrough the next course of this certificate\nprogram. We’ll discuss security domains and\nbusiness operations in greater detail.\nI’m so glad I was able to be here for the\nbeginning of your journey.\nYou’re off to a great start.\nI'm excited for you to reach your goal of\njoining the security industry!\n",
