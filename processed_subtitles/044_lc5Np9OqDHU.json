  "text": "20 years ago, I was advocating for JavaScript.\nMy story was that JavaScript is a much\nbetter language than anybody knows\nand that if we use it properly we can do amazing\nthings about it and it can change the world\nand in fact that happened.\nBut now my evangel is that\nwe should stop using JavaScript.\nThat it has so many congenital defects \nit really is a smelly language.\nThere's a just a lot of crap in it.\nAnd it's still maybe for its field of application\nthe best language in the world \nfor doing that kind of stuff\nbut that's not good enough.\nWe should be moving on to the \nnext generation of languages.\nIt used to be that we'd get new computer \nlanguages about every generation.\n I started with Fortran and then C and  \nC++ and Java and JavaScript and \nso on and then it kind of stopped.\nThere are still people developing \nlanguages but nobody cares.\nOne person can make a programming\nlanguage, a really good one,\nbut you can't get adoption for it.\nThere are lots of terrible mistakes \nin the way that the web works,\nin the way our operating systems \nwork, and we can't get new ones.\nWe're just stuck with this crap and they\nkeep piling new features on everything\nand the new features always \ncreate new problems and\nit doesn't have to be like that. We could \nbe using really clean operating systems\nwith really clean languages and really \nclean runtimes and doing all this stuff\nin a much more reliable way.\nBut we don't seem to want to do that.\nI've done JavaScript for a generation.\nIt's time for the next thing.\nAnd I don't think that should be a\nconsidered a radical point of view. I \nthink it should be a normal evolutionary view.\n",
