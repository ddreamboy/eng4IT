  "text": "welcome back Learners it's time for\nquestion two to find out how machines\nlearn let's go which of the following\nbest describes the primary difference\nbetween supervised and unsupervised\nlearning in machine learning is it a\nsupervised learning uses labeled data\nfor training while unsupervised learning\nuses unlabeled data or could it be B\nsupervised learning clusters data in the\ngroups while unsupervised predicts\noutcomes based on input\nfeatures or is supervised used for image\nrecognition while unsupervised is used\nfor language\ntranslation or could it be that\nsupervised models are deterministic\nwhile unsupervised models are\nnon-deterministic what do you think it's\na supervised learning uses labeled data\nfor training while unsupervised learning\nuses unlabeled data and let's see why\nthink of it like you're teaching a kid\nmath if you give them a worksheet where\nevery problem has the answer written\nnext to it that supervis learning you're\nguiding them by showing them both the\nproblem and the solution so they can\nlearn from these examples now if you\ngive them a bunch of problems with no\nanswers and they have to figure out the\npatterns on their own that's\nunsupervised learning distractor B said\nthat supervised learning clusters the\ndata but that's not actually what\nunsupervised learning does it's more\nlike giving the kid a bunch of random\ntoys and saying sort these into groups\nwell without telling them how No Labels\njust patterns to discover the other one\nsays supervised learning is used for\nimage recognition and the other one for\nlanguage translation which isn't really\ntrue it's this is more about labeled\nversus unlabeled data not what kind of\nproblems they solve and then D says\nsupervised learning is deterministic\nwhile unsupervised is\nnon-deterministic nope both of them can\nuse both behaviors so that's really not\nthe key difference here well that's it\nfor question two thanks for watching and\nsee you next time\n",
