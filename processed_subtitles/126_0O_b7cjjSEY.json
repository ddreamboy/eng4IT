  "text": "- When we're talking\nabout video surveillance.\nI mean, I can imagine\nwhy it would be appealing\nto attackers, but are\nthere certain aspects of it\nthat make us particularly vulnerable?\n- You have seen the movies, right?\n- Yeah. (chuckles)\n- So, what you see in the\nmovies is actually not that far\nfrom the real world.\nSo, attacking the surveillance system\nis the first thing a criminal will do.\nThe surveillance systems\nare in the frontline.\n- Do you feel like you're on\nthe frontline of a big threat\nor what's it like when\nyou're kind of on the ground?\n- You can say that our customers\nput a huge amount of trust\nin Milestone because they use our software\nas a security control to make sure\nthat they can actually\ninvestigate criminal behavior\non their premises with the cameras\nand the video surveillance system.\nSo yeah, I feel responsible\nfor our customers' security, of course.\n- Do you feel like a movie star?\nYou mentioned the movies.\n- (laughs) Maybe not so much,\nbut I can't help feel responsible\nfor the wellbeing and\nsecurity of our customers.\n- So, if you were to look\nat the current landscape\nof cyber security, what do you think\nare some of the biggest threats today?\n- When I think about the top three,\nwhat immediately comes to my\nmind is ransomware and malware.\nI mean, we hear about it every\nsingle day, more or less,\nnew ransomware attacks.\nAnd some statistics even\nsay that every 14 seconds\nthere is a new victim\nfor ransomware attacks.\nThe downtime you have in your business,\nrebuilding of all the systems et cetera,\nit has enormous financial impact.\n- What about endpoint, I\nknow that's also an issue?\n- Yeah endpoint security is\nalso a huge thing as I see it,\nbecause the way we have moved\nin the past 10, 15 years,\nwhere we have moved,\na lot from our on-premise\nsystem, in closed networks,\nwe are now, everything is on the internet.\nWe are using cloud services.\nWe are using remote\nworkstations, we work from home.\nThe attack surface has\ndramatically increased\nover the past many years.\nSo I would say that is\nprobably number two on my list.\nAnd the third is the very\nvery good old phishing.\nEven though we have a lot of knowledge\nabout how to deal with it,\nwe train people et cetera,\nbut it's still just keeps coming.\n- Just when you mentioned training.\nI mean, I imagine that's one method\nof trying to counter\ncybersecurity threats,\nbut just in terms of solutions,\nwhat are some of the options\nthat are available today?\n- Yeah, when it comes to the solution\nis really a two edged sword as I see it.\nThere are two very very\nvery important factors.\nFirst of all, it is, and\nthe most important one,\nsecurity awareness and employee training,\nthough, that is the most important one.\nThen we have the second one,\nwhich is the security policies,\nand the technical\ncontrols we have in place.\n- Maybe if we're looking\nat that in practice,\nif I'm an employee, say,\nare there certain, just good practices,\njust things that I should be doing\nin order to protect the organization,\nand I guess myself and my reputation?\n- Yeah, and so you need to be aware,\nand you need to be skeptical\nwhen you look at contents\nof mails to determine whether\nit is a phishing mail.\nAnd be aware of what links you click on.\nYou might be thinking\nthat is that really right?\nAnd you need to have that\ncommon sense of skepticism\nto evaluate whether these\nactions you are asked to do\nare sound or not.\n- I know myself, I've, sometimes\nyou get like a text message\nand it comes from your bank.\nIt looks as though, like\nit's with the same messages,\nhow did they do that, do we know?\n(both laughing)\n- That there are many, I don't think that\nwe should go into all the\ntechnical details about this.\nBut you're absolutely right,\nthe phishing mails today\ncan really look trustworthy\nwhen you look at them.\nBut there are always a science\nthat will show they are scams.\n- These things like typos or?\n- Yeah, but the typos actually,\nit's actually a very deliberate.\nYou have read these weird\nspelled phishing mails.\nThe reason why they put them in there\nis to lure away the\npeople who can actually,\nyou can say that can actually recognize\nthese kinds of things immediately.\nSo we have people who will\nnot fall into the trap,\nbecause when you start a\nphishing campaign, for example,\nor we also had these scam calls,\nwe have different kinds of things,\nwhere you are trying to\nlure people into something\nthen you start up a dialogue,\nand then eventually you get\nthe trust of the victim,\nand then you can start\nextorting money et cetera.\nSo, the bad spells is\nactually just to lure a way\nthose people who will never\nfall into the trap anyways.\nSo that is very very targeted.\nIt is not because those\nwho are creating these\nphishing mails are bad at writing.\nSo that is very deliberate.\n- Okay, all right.\nThat makes me feel a little bit better\nthat I might just spot them.\nYou mentioned about, was\nit called spear phishing?\nThis is where you're specifically...\n- This email looks like it\ncomes from the CTO to the PA,\n\"Please immediately transfer\nsome money to some account\nbecause we are closing a\nbig deal or we are in...\"\n- It's always urgent.\n- Yes it's a very urgent,\nbut this is about,\nthe spear phishing part is about where\nyou mention specific names\nand you make it look like specific people.\n- And I mean, how much can this escalate?\nIs it just to keep piling the pressure on,\nor do they use multiple methods\nof trying to lure someone?\n- They try new methods\nall the time, of course.\nAnd there are actually lying\na lot of research behind,\nor you can say information gathering\nbehind these kinds of the\nspear phishing attacks,\nwhere the attackers really do\na lot of information gathering\naround the company and the people in there\nto make these phishing attacks\nas legitimate looking as possible, so.\n- Okay, so it's the\nopposite of the typos...\n- Yeah that is the opposite\nof the typos, yes, yes.\n- And we started this\nconversation talking about\nthe rise in ransomware,\nyou mentioned as one of\nthe areas of threats.\nJust in terms of your take\non this kind of slightly,\nmaybe controversial or questionable area.\nThere's always the question\nwhen you're under attack\nas a company, being asked to pay a ransom,\nthe money is probably not\ngoing to be going to good use.\nWhat's your take on this situation?\n- The approach should be, in my opinion,\nthat you invest heavily into preventing\nthe situation for occurring\nin the first place,\nand making sure that if you\nare hit, when you're hit,\nthat it has the minimum\namount of damage it can do.\nAnd there are procedures,\nthere are best practices\nin place for that.\nThe problem is that of\ncourse it cost money.\nIt cost a lot of money to have\nthese kinds of plans,\ndisaster recovery plans,\nbusiness continuity plans,\nand all these kinds of how to\nreact when disaster hits you.\nIt cost a lot of money.\nAnd, it is easy to cut on that budget\nand say, ah, it probably\nworks well, okay let's see,\nbecause you don't get immediate,\nyou can say return of investment\non money spent on security.\nYou only get it when you\nare attacked, of course.\nSo that would be my approach to this.\nAnd also because when organizations\nare not properly secured\nand do not probably have these plans\nto limit the damage done,\nand ideally prevent it,\nit is also just encouraging\nthese criminal guys\nto do more ransomware attacks.\nBecause when there is a market\nfor criminal activities,\nof course it will continue to be there.\nSo, we won't get this solved until\ncompanies, organizations actually make it\na bad business to be\na ransomware attacker.\n- Prevention is crucial.\n- Prevention is the best\nway to do this, yeah.\n- Carsten, that's all we have time for.\nThank you very much for joining me today.\n- Okay, thank you for having\nme, it has been a pleasure.\nThank you very much.\n",
