  "text": "[Music]\nhey everyone welcome to this crash\ncourse on robotic process automation aka\nrpa\nbefore we begin let me walk you through\nthe content it's going to cover first we\nlook at a quick introduction to rpa\nthen i'll help you understand the top\nreasons to learn rpa\nmoving on we'll work hands-on with the\nhelp of two tutorials on uipath followed\nby which we look at a detailed\ncomparison between blue prism uipath and\nautomation anywhere\ni will also guide you through the\ncorrect path you could take to become an\nrpa developer and brief you about salary\nand skills\nand lastly we look at the top interview\nquestions that will help you crack your\nnext rpa interview and all of this under\n2 hours\nso without further ado let's begin but\nbefore that if you wish to keep yourself\nupdated with all the cutting edge\ntechnologies then subscribe to our\nchannel and hit the bell icon\nthis is jim he is an accountant in a\nmultinational company he handles several\ninvoices and other financial records\nlike monetary transactions liabilities\nchecks and ledgers on a daily basis one\nof his tasks is to copy all the relevant\ninformation from these invoices such as\nthe name of the company invoice id and\ndata processing into a spreadsheet and\nmail the sheet along with other\nfinancial reports to his superiors by\nthe end of the day as any prompt\nemployee he transfers all the\ninformation to the sheet attaches the\nreports and sends them over to his boss\nvia email every day\nbut over a period he starts finding this\ntask to be time consuming and repetitive\nfrustrated jim looks for a way to reduce\nthe time and effort it takes to complete\nthe task and voila he stumbles across\nrobotic process automation aka rpa using\nrobotic process automation he builds a\nsimple bot that extracts information\nfrom several invoices into an excel\nsheet attaches all the necessary\nfinancial reports and sends them over to\nhis superiors via email at a specific\ntime every day\nso what exactly is robotic process\nautomation\nrobotic process automation rpa is the\nuse of software with artificial\nintelligence and machine learning\ncapabilities to handle high-volume\nrepetitive tasks that previously\nrequired humans to perform some of these\ntasks include addressing queries making\ncalculations maintenance of records and\nperforming transactions there are\nseveral misconceptions about rpa rpa is\nnot a humanoid robot it does not have a\nphysical form and no resemblance to\nhumans rpa cannot replace humans or\nreplicate human cognitive functions it\ndoes not have a brain of its own\nand cannot perform logical or critical\nthinking as humans do the working of rpa\nincludes four crucial phases\none the planning phase typically\ninvolves gathering the processes to be\nautomated identifying the test objects\nand finalizing the implementation\napproach\ntwo the development phase includes the\ncreation of automation workflows as per\nthe agreed plan\nthree deployment and testing is a vital\nphase\nsince it uncovers any unexpected outages\nand ensures a bug-free product\nfour\nlastly there's the support and\nmaintenance phase which ensures that the\nproduct is continuously updated with\nsmooth deployment across the user base\nto meet the objectives of rpa tools are\nused\nthese rpa tools are software\napplications that can configure tasks\nand automate them\nsome of the popular rpa tools in the\nmarket are uipath automation anywhere\nblue prism work fusion pega and redwood\namong others when it comes to quality\nrpa ensures consistent error-free output\nleading to reduced operational risks\nthis in turn improves customer\nsatisfaction\nin the area of delivery rpa can help\ndecrease the average handling time and\nthis enhances the customer experience\nand ensures 24 7 business continuity\nwith respect to cost according to nascom\ndomestic businesses can reduce the cost\nby up to 65\nthrough rpa\nit offers a higher roi by driving\npositive returns within quarters as\nopposed to years other advantages of rpa\ninclude reduced training costs minimal\nutilization of i.t resources and easier\nsoftware migration\ntoday many domains and industries like\nbanking and finance i.t integration\nprocesses human resources insurance\nagencies marketing and sales and\ncustomer relationship management readily\ndeploy rpa\nrpa service adoption has been showing\ntremendous growth since 2016 and will\ncontinue to increase beyond 2020.\naccording to mckenzie's research\nknowledge and work automation could have\nan economic impact of five to seven\ntrillion dollars by the year 2025\nit will impact more than 230 million\nknowledge workers which constitute nine\npercent of the global workforce\nany company which is labor intensive\nwhere people are performing high volume\nhigh transaction functions stand to\nbenefit the most with rpa adoption\nboosting their capabilities and saving\nmoney and time\nnow in today's video we're going to be\nlearning all about robotic process\nautomation so if you're new to this\ntopic then this session will definitely\nhelp you understand rpa better so\nwithout further ado let's jump in and\nlook at what's in store for us so the\ntopics we're going to be covering in\nthis session are why rpa automation\nversus rpa what is rpa what is not rpa\nfeatures benefits types some of our pa\nsoftware tools its services some of the\nindustries adopting rpa and its growth\nprojections so let's begin by\nunderstanding the necessity of rpa now\nimagine having to solve complex\nmathematical problems manually it's\npossible but not all that easy to make\nlife a little easier calculators were\ninvented they proved to be accurate easy\nand time-saving however these\nconventional calculators need human\ninput now this is partial automation so\ndoes a calculator qualify to fall under\nthe rpa framework well no robotic\nprocess automation on the other hand\nwould be completely automating the\nworking of a calculator where it\nrequires zero human interaction now\nlet's compare traditional automation\nwith rpa consider an invoice processing\nsoftware now this software would\nautomatically generate these invoices in\na strategic manner however the\nprocessing requires human interaction on\nthe other hand to ensure complete\nend-to-end automation rpa plays the key\nrole rpa is an approach that allows one\nto automate the manual interactions in a\nknown process traditional automation\ninvolves programming apis and\nintegration tools to integrate different\nsystems rp on the other hand mimics the\nactions of a user at the user interface\nlevel these actions could be mouse\nclicks or keystrokes since the developer\ndirectly interacts with the software he\nmust have a clear understanding of the\ntarget system in case of automation but\nthat's not the case in rpa as long as\nthe bot can exactly follow the steps the\ndeveloper need not worry about the\nunderlying complexities so let's move\nahead and understand what is rpa rpa is\nthe use of software with ai and machine\nlearning capabilities now these\nsoftwares handle high volume repeated\ntasks that previously required humans to\nperform now rba approach sticks to the\nfront end only making it easier for its\nusers so rpa basically is a\nconfiguration that automates repetitive\ntasks some of these tasks could be\nanswering queries making calculations\nmaintaining records or even handling\ntransactions to give you an example\nconsider an employee handling invoices\nin a company now his duty would include\nprinting these invoices for audit\npurposes now doing this regularly proves\nto be strenuous and monotonous rpa helps\novercome this it can be used to open the\ninvoice mail from the supplier extract\nthe invoice and print it for records all\nof which requires zero effort from the\nemployee now i'm sure you'll understand\nrpa better with a small demonstration\nnow consider you have to display a\nwelcome message on a regular basis now\ninstead of manually typing it every time\nyou definitely want to automate it for\nthis purpose we make use of an rpa tool\ncalled ui paths now don't worry we'll\nlearn about this later in the session ui\npath studio is a tool used to develop\nrpa bots for specific functions now let\nme navigate to my ui path studio and\nhere i'll create a new project let me\ncall it\nmessage 101 i'll say create\nall right so this is how the ui path\nstudio looks let me get rid of this and\nhere you have various activities that\nyou can perform so a sequence is\nbasically a set of activities that is\ndefined in a particular order it also\nexecutes in that particular order so\nwhat i can do is i can drag and drop\nthis here and within the sequence i drag\nand drop my activity so i want to\ndisplay a message so i drag the message\nbox and drop it here the message that i\nwant to display must be quoted within\ndouble quotes so i say hello welcome to\nrpa tutorial and i save it and after\nthat i run it so once i do that it has\nto display the message on my screen so\nlet's see if it does that voila here we\ngo you can see the message being\ndisplayed so this was a simple example\nof how rpa works using this tool you can\npractically automate complex\nfunctionalities we learn all about ui\npath in detail in the upcoming videos so\nstay tuned for that moving ahead let's\nsee some of the common misconceptions\nabout rpa rpa is not a humanoid robot\ncertain dynamic applications and\nprocesses that require human actions\ncannot be completely automated rpa can\nalso not replace humans it can only be\nused for known processes it doesn't have\na brain of its own and cannot perform\nhuman-like activities and lastly it\ncannot replicate human cognitive\nfunctions it definitely lacks logical\nthinking and does not possess decision\nmaking skills let's look at some of the\nkey features of rpa a rich analytical\nsuite now most enterprise level rpa\nmonitors and manages automated functions\nfrom a central console now this console\ncan be accessed from anywhere and offers\nbasic metrics on robots servers\nworkflows etc now this solution of rpa\nrequires no integration since everything\nis inbuilt creation of bots now rpa\ntools allow quick creation of bots by\ncapturing mouse clicks and keystrokes\nwith built-in screen recorder components\nnow many rpa products include the option\nto create and edit bots manually with\nthe help of a task editor scriptless\nautomation now rpa tools are code free\nand can automate applications in any\ndepartment employees with less\nprogramming skills can create bots\nthrough guise or graphical user\ninterface now this feature reduces the\namount of hand code writing and improves\nthe rate of delivery next up we have\nsecurity rpa tools enable the\nconfiguration as well as customization\nof encryption methods now this helps\ndefend against any interruption in the\nnetwork hosting and deployment rba\nsystems can automatically deploy bots in\ngroups of hundreds hence rpa bots can be\ninstalled on desktops and deployed on\nservers to access data for repetitive\ntasks lastly we have debugging some rpa\ntools require to stop running to rectify\nthe errors while other tools allow\ndynamic interaction while debugging now\nthis dynamic approach allows to develop\non the go and to resolve issues in a\nruntime environment without changing the\nprocess now let's look at some of the\nbenefits of rpa reduces cost one of the\nmost important advantages of rpa is the\nquick reduction in cost by automating\ntasks the cost saving of almost 30\npercent can be achieved software robots\nalso cost way less than a full-time\nemployee reduces operational risk\nvarious companies generally prefer to\noutsource busy work to external parties\nnow this comes with an inherent risk of\nhuman errors and inefficiency rpa brings\nforth a better solution and since the\nwork stays in-house there is less\noperational risk quality and accuracy\nrpa offers services to processes with\nhigh probability of human errors thereby\nincreasing accuracy robots are reliable\nand consistent and don't complain when\nexpected to work tirelessly scalability\nwith the help of rpa companies can make\nadjustments based on seasonality and can\neasily scale up or down operations as\nneeded moving on let's learn about the\ntypes of rpa first up we have unattended\nor autonomous rpa now these are ideally\nused for reducing work like completing\ndata processing tasks in the background\nnow these bots can be generally launched\nat specific intervals or they can be\nbought initiated or they can be\ninitiated when there's a data input\nsecond up we have attended rpa now these\nbots live on the user's machines and are\ntriggered by the user so some sort of\nhuman interaction is required they are\nusually launched when they're embedded\non the employee's device or they can be\nauthored based on conditions or they can\nbe initiated with the help of an rpa\nclient tool thirdly we have hybrid rpa\nas the name suggests it's a combination\nof attended and unattended rpa these\nbots address front and back office tasks\nin the enterprise next up we have rpa\nsoftware tools now robotic process tools\nare used for the automation of\nrepetitive back office processes now\nthere are numerous rpa tools available\nin the market some of them are\nautomation anywhere uipath blue prism\npega and work fusion among others in the\nupcoming videos we'll discuss some of\nthese tools in detail watch out for that\nmoving on let's look at some of the rpa\nservices now these rpa services\ngenerally include common business\nprocesses like opening emails and\nattachments filling in forms and moving\nfolders follow if then rules connect to\nsystem apis extract structured data from\ndocuments make complex calculations\nmonitor manual processes and learn how\nto perform them example machine learning\ncopy and paste read and write to\ndatabases scrap data from documents log\ninto web or enterprise applications and\nso on now that we have a clear idea on\nwhat rpa is let's go ahead and look at\nsome of the industries adopting rpa\nfirst up we have banking and finance rpa\nhas been a boon to the finance industry\nwith its significant impact on reducing\nconsiderable work volumes human\nresources typically with hr processes\nwitnessing a high volume of repetitive\ntasks the rpa could significantly\nimprove the rate efficiency and cost\neffectiveness in the functions it can be\nused to run tasks in careers and\nlearning talent acquisition etc\nmarketing and sales rpa is helping\norganizations in building the sales\npipeline and engaging with their\ncustomers more efficiently i.t\nintegration processes rpa can be used to\nintegrate legacy and newer systems in\nautomation endeavors insurance agencies\nrpa has empowered insurers in building a\nhigh growth responsive business while\noptimizing cost lastly we have customer\nrelationship management rpa software can\nautomatically keep your crm maintained\nwith the most up-to-date and accurate\ninformation lastly let's look at the rpa\ngrowth projections and its future both\nrpa software and services increased by\nhuge amounts between 2016 and 2021 and\nbeyond according to mckinsey research\nknowledge and work automation could have\nan economic impact of five to seven\ntrillion dollars by the year 2025. it\nwill touch more than 230 million\nknowledge workers which is almost nine\npercent of the global workforce any\ncompany which is labor intensive where\npeople are performing high volume high\ntransaction functions will boost their\ncapabilities and save money and time\nwith rpa\nso why is rpa gaining popularity so\nrapidly and why do companies and techies\nhave rpa perspectives\nso here are the 10 reasons why one\nshould learn rpa\nso number 10 fast implementation\nnow getting data entry bots up and\nrunning\ngoes quickly\nimplementing a new rpa software system\ncertainly happens much faster than\ntraining a new person\nyou can have these data entry bots up\nand running in just days\nin contrast if you wanted to hire a new\nhuman employee you'd be taking a lot of\ntime in sorting out resumes conducting\ninterviews going through the entire\nboring hiring process and then finally\nwhen you find the right person you'd\nhave to spend time and energy on\ntraining them\nhowever in case of rpa all of this is\ncountered\nand number nine we have no training time\nso now this is an important one\nif your process changes and the bots\nneed to learn something new you can\neither replace them with new bots or\nalter their programming\nnow that again goes much faster than\ntraining employees for new tasks\nin terms of costs training an employee\nfor a new task will pan out to be way\nmore expensive and time consuming\nnext up the bots will never quit\nnow with rpa you don't have to worry\nabout employees quitting or dealing with\nthe turnover\nbots don't care how hard they're working\nor how boring their job is or how\nrepeatedly they're doing the same tasks\nagain yes it would be ironic if the bots\ngot tired\nsoftware bots can work all the time 24\nhours a day every single day of the year\nat 100 capacity\nnow rpa doesn't take holidays it doesn't\nhave sick needs and of course they do\nnot have unproductive days at all\nwell isn't that a treat to have someone\nwho never retires or decides it's time\nto move to a different job\nnext up minimal i.t resources\nmaintaining software bots requires\nminimal i.t resources\nin some cases\nit doesn't id doesn't need to get\ninvolved at all\nyour rpa systems will be managed by the\nsoftware provider\nthey're responsible for maintenance and\nupdates all of that\nit completely takes the burden off it\nand saves your company a whole lot of\nmoney\nroi is visible\nnow every organization wants to quantify\ntheir gains\nmany of these organizations do not know\nhow they should determine their roi\nbut when it comes to adopting robotic\nprocess automation roi is visible it\ndefines a clearer path to demonstrate\nits returns\ncomplex problems can be solved now as\nour data sources and analytical\ncapabilities have grown so has the time\nrequired to build various reports\nrobotic process automation system is\nideal for solution\nto solve these types of problems\nthe system stores the information and it\ncan also remember and transform this\ninformation very easily\nthat means this makes you auditable and\ntax ready\nsoftware migration\nnow it's a fact that software migrations\nare time consuming and costly\nmigrating to a new software could take\nmonths and cost could turn out to be\ntens or thousands of millions of dollars\nwhat's even more frustrating is that at\nall times\ncertain features and functionalities\nwhich may have functioned in a\nparticular way in a previous\nversion may not even be present in the\nupdated version\nso rpa helps with data migration with\naccuracy speed and continuous updating\nof software\nrpa has a free tier\nmany rpa vendors offer free tiers\nsome of these vendors are blue prism\nautomation anywhere ui path among others\nthese rpa software vendors are offering\nhigh\nrpa software notably ui path with their\ncommunity edition and work fusion with\ntheir rpa express\nthis helps lower the total cost of\nownership\nthere's no rip and replace\nnow rpa doesn't jeopardize an employee's\njob but helps with the growth of new\njobs to do your work you need some\nadditional software yes and virtual\nmachines to deploy fully independent\ndigital bots\nbut you may not need to rip and replace\nyour existing infrastructures\nalso there's a common misconception that\nrpa could steal our jobs\nwell that's not true\nmonitoring and controlling these bots\nare completely the responsibilities of\nthe developer\nas a result rpa does not pull down your\nexisting systems but it leverages them\nlastly popularity and high salary\naccording to glassdoor the average\nsalary of an rpa developer in the us is\n77 000 us dollars and in india\nthe beginning salary for an rpa\ndeveloper is around 4.65 lakhs per annum\ntop tier companies like dell\nibm accenture capgemini cognizant among\nothers are readily hiring rpa developers\nnow this is all you need to know about\nwhy one should learn rpa\nbut if you're looking to become a\ndeveloper let's look at some of the job\nroles and responsibilities rpa\ndevelopers are responsible for the\ncreation design development and\nimplementation of rpa systems\nan rpa developer is expected\nto provide guidance with process design\ndesign develop test automation flip\nworkflows\ndeploy rpa components be it bots robots\nor development tools\nsupport the implementation of rpa\nsolutions\ncreate process documentation\nand also assure the quality of the\nautomation\nnow that we have a clear understanding\nof what rpa is and what it's not you\nmust be wondering how it works so let's\nhave a closer look at its working\nthe first step towards any approach is\nplanning in this stage the processes to\nbe automated are defined which includes\nidentifying the test objects finalizing\nan implementation approach and defining\na clear roadmap for the rpa\nimplementation next we have design and\ndevelopment\nas the name suggests in this phase you\nstart developing the automation\nworkflows as per the agreed plan third\nis deployment and testing this phase\ntypically includes the execution of the\nbots now any expected outages are to be\ntaken care of during the deployment to\nensure accurate functioning testing of\nthese bots for bugs and errors is\ncrucial\nlastly is support and maintenance now\nproviding constant support helps in\nidentifying and rectifying the errors\nbetter\nmoving on we have rpa software tools now\nthese tools typically help develop and\nexecute bots some of the rpa tools are\nuipath blue prism automation anywhere\nwork fusion among others in this\ntutorial we will execute a bot using the\nuipath tool\nbefore executing a demo test case let's\ngo ahead and understand what ui path is\nand its interface\nuipath is basically an advanced rpa tool\nwhich allows you to create control and\nexecute front office and back office\nbots with the help of visual templates\nand diagrams now it also provides\nend-to-end automation calling it hyper\nautomation uipath offers three different\nproduct suites first up we have uipath\nstudio now it is a platform to create\nautomation bots it encompasses hundreds\nof activity templates and ready made\ncomponents to drag and drop now some of\nits features include gui dashboard which\nbasically consists of activities like\nsend email display message and so on it\noffers different types of recorders to\nrecord user actions on multiple\nplatforms it provides logging and\nexceptional handling it also has\nreusable components now the user can\ncreate these reusable components to\npublish them together as libraries the\nnext product suite is uipath robot now\nthey run automation bots that are\ncreated using uipath studio there are\ndifferent types of robots firstly we\nhave the attended robots now these\nrobots work with you to speed up the\nservice desk and the help desk it's\nbasically used in activities where human\ninvolvement is key next up we have\nunattended robots now they operate\nwithout the human touch maximizing the\ncost and performance benefits for any\nvariety of back office tasks the third\nproduct suite is the orchestrator now it\nis a centralized robot management\ndashboard where you can easily deploy\nsecure and manage your ui path robots at\nscale now here's the course of action\nthe first step is that the user creates\na bot next the user has to save this\nproject and which is later used as a\nprocess now once the process is created\nit is assigned to a specific robot to\nexecute it this collectively constitutes\na job and all of which is taken care of\nby the uipath orchestrator now let's\nunderstand the uipath interface in brief\nfirst up we have the recorder now as the\nname suggests this component allows the\nuser to record all user actions such as\nnavigations clicks etc next up is\nscraping now it involves two components\none is the screen scraping which is the\nprogrammatic collection of visual data\nand the other one is data scraping which\nis the extraction of structured data\nfrom an application user events now all\nmouse clicks and keystrokes given by the\nuser as input are recorded using this\nfeature lastly we have variables now\nvariables are used primarily for using\ncertain features now these variables\nhold different types of data and can\nchange over time all right now that we\nhave a fair understanding of ui path\nlet's go ahead and execute a simple test\ncase so here's what we're going to be\ndoing first we extract information about\nbooks on the website that is\ngoodreads.com so what information are we\nextracting so we're going to be\nextracting the names and the authors of\nthe new released books then this\ninformation is going to be stored in an\nexcel sheet and this excel sheet is\ngoing to be sent over an email so let's\ngo ahead and execute the test case all\nright so let's go ahead and open ui path\nstudio and here you go and click on new\nprocess in the top right corner\nall right and provide a name for it say\nrpa\nand i say create\nso now this is going to create a\nworkspace for you this might take up a\nfew seconds\nand this is what the typical uipath\nstudio interface looks like so moving\nahead we need to create a sequence of\nactivities so for that let's go ahead\nand say new sequence to the top left\ncorner and provide a name for it i\nchoose to keep it sequence so i say\ncreate\nbut what exactly is a sequence now\nsequence is a set of activities so all\nthe activities mentioned in a sequence\nare executed in the same order all right\nso now in our use case we are going to\nbe scraping data from the goodreads.com\nwebsite right okay so now we'll have to\nnavigate to the goodreads.com website\nand i've opened it in my browser\nso here we've navigated to the most\npopular books published in march 2020.\nso now i have to extract data from this\nright i need\ntwo fields basically i need the name\nof the book and the author\nalright so what we're gonna do is we go\nback to uipath studio and click on data\nscraping\nso go ahead and click on data scraping\nand here it says open your browser or\napplication and wherever you want to\nextract your data from and then we click\non next and then click on the field that\nyou want to select\nso i say next and here i want just the\nname right so i click on the name\nand it says you selected an entire table\ncell would you like to extract the data\nfrom the whole table no i just want the\nname of the table right so i say no\nand now the next thing you need to do is\nyou have to create a pattern the tool\nneeds to understand what exactly you are\nextracting so what we do is we have to\ncreate a pattern\nto do that we have to select a second\nelement so i say next again\nand i click on the second name here i\nsay click and now the name of the column\nthat i want to give so i say books and i\nsay next\nnow so this is how it's going to look\nthis is the data preview\nright so next we need the name of the\nauthor so i say extract correlated data\nhere\nso go ahead and click on that and now i\nneed the name so i say i click on sarah\nj maas\nand again to create a pattern i need to\nselect another element so i say next and\nclick on the next name of the author so\ni click on this\nand i\ngive the name author for this column all\nright so i click on next\nokay so this is how it's going to look\nso after this i say finish\nall right so now it's going to ask me if\ndata is spanning across multiple pages\nnow in our case if you look at this\npage data is not spanning across\nmultiple pages say suppose you had one\ntwo three four five saying there are\nmore books ahead then that would be data\nspanning across multiple pages so that\nis not the case here so i say no in our\ncase\nand that is it\nso we have scraped our data from the\nwebsite okay so now that we're done with\ndata scraping the information that has\nbeen extracted has to be saved in a csv\nfile\nso for that you have to create the file\nso go to your activities and say write\ncsv all right so just drag and drop\nthe activity here\nnow it asks for two fields right so the\nfirst one is a target field where the\ninformation is stored so provide a name\nfor it for that let's go ahead and\nbrowse it\nand\nin my case\ni create a document say demo\none\nunderscore rpa\nand save it\nall right and the next field is the\nwrite from field now the information\nthat you're storing in the csv file is\nbasically the output of data scraping so\nthat is all the information from the\ndata scripting event is stored in an\noutput variable\nso click on that and here you see you\nhave an output variable so copy the\noutput variable ctrl c and then paste it\nhere\norder now save the file and now let's\nexecute it to see if it successfully\nworks\nso\ngo ahead and click on play\nso all right it's completed the\nexecution so let's go ahead and check\nif it has completed the execution\ncorrectly so i go back to my documents\nui path and we have demo one underscore\nrpa\nopen that\nand\nhere we go\nwe have the name of the author\nand the book all right so this works\ncompletely fine\nokay so the next step in our use case is\nto attach the csv file and send over an\nemail\nnow for that you have to provide your\ncredentials that is your email id and\nthe password now these credentials are\nalso used multiple times across the test\ncase so instead of specifying it every\ntime we can create two variables right\none for the email id and one for the\npassword so for that click on variables\nhere\nand say create variable\nand\nokay we have one already here so\nlet's call it email\nand the other one\nis called\npassword\nso go ahead and provide your credentials\nso i provide my email id\nand then my password\nokay and then save it\nall right now we have to attach this csv\nfile and send over an email right for\nthat we have an activity\ncalled send smtp mail message\nso go ahead and drag and drop it here\nand now it has three fields it has the\ntwo field the subject field and the body\nfield right so two is where you provide\nthe email id\nso here i just say email because i've\nalready defined a variable the next is\nthe subject so i say\nattachment\nand say the body i'll keep it simple and\nsay pfa okay now we have to attach the\nfile right so click on attach files and\nhere we have to provide the path to the\nfile\nso go back to the place where you've\nsaved your csv file and\ncopy the path\nand paste it here\nas an expression and at the end you\nprovide the name of the file so it was\ndemo one underscore rpa dot csv\nokay so now go ahead click on ok\nnow we have a lot of other fields to\nprovide here as well\nso here\nwe have\nthe port field now the smtp port that\nwe're using is number 465 so go ahead\nand provide that\nand the server\nis basically smtp.gmail.com\nall right and again we have to provide\nthe email ids that is just email\nand this is just\npassword\nand then\ntwo is also provided already and the\nsender is again me so i say\nemail again\nand the password is again password\nall right\nso now save it\nokay and as you can see\nthere are no errors\nthat means it's good to go\nokay so let's go ahead and execute this\nand see if it executes successfully so\ngo ahead and execute it\nall right so it has successfully\nfinished its execution so now let's go\nto my gmail account and see if i've\nreceived an email and yes i have\nso go ahead and click on that\nand here\ni download the file and see if it's\nappropriately sent and here we go so\nhere we go we have the name of the book\nand the author\nokay so with this we've successfully\nimplemented an rpa bot for email\nautomation hey everyone\nwelcome to this session by simply learn\nin this video\nwe will learn about ui path studio in\ndepth and understand it's working with a\ndemo\nthis tutorial will help you understand\nthe following concepts\nyou will learn what is uipath\nand the various advantages of uipath\nthen\nyou will look at the different products\noffered by uipath and understand the\nuipath interface\nafter that you will see the companies\nusing uipath and look at a demo to\nautomate a task using uipath studio\nso without further ado let's begin\nso what is uipath\nnow rpa is a technology with which human\ntasks can be automated\nto facilitate this a tool is required\nuipath is one such tool among others\nthat are used to create bots with the\nhelp of visual processes and diagrams\nit provides complete end-to-end\nautomation calling it hyper automation\nui path was founded by daniel dynes and\nmarius turka in 2005.\nuipath is specially used for windows\nprocess automation\nit automates repetitive tasks\nand lastly\nuipath offers drag and drop\nfunctionalities to make it easy to use\nnow since there are so many other tools\nlike blue prism automation anywhere in\nthe market what makes uipath stand out\nso let's look at the advantages of\nuipath\nfirst\nuipath has an activity library\nthis library has several built-in\nactivities and features like display\nmessage\ninput box and so on this improves the\ncustomer experience\nwe will deal with these activities in\nthe demo later\nnext up\nis security\nrpa deals with a variety of information\nlike credit card numbers financial\ninformation and passwords\nuipath offers extensive security since\nall the information can be encrypted and\nstored on a centralized server\nup next we have recorders\nso ui path uses a micro recorder to\nrecord the user actions such as mouse\nclicks and keystrokes\nonce the actions are recorded they can\nbe emulated using emulators for quick\nautomation\nthird-party integration\nui path can be integrated with third\nparty plugins like ibm watson and google\nplugins\nthen we have powerful debugging\nui path studio comes with a debug\ncomponent that helps find and locate\nproblems easily in complex workflows\nthis is useful for viewing the execution\nof each activity to verify what data it\ngets and if there are errors in\nproducing outputs\nnow let's understand the various ui path\nproducts\nfirst up is uipath studio\nthis is the platform to create the bots\nthis product consists of all the\nnecessary drag and drop activities and a\nrobust ui to help develop bots of your\nchoice now the uipath studio consists of\nthe gui dashboard\nit offers a visual dashboard with\nactivities like send email display\nmessage and so on\nthen we have types of recorders uipath\nstudio offers various types of recorders\nto record actions on multiple platforms\nthen we have logging and exception\nhandling\nit offers various options for debugging\nand exception handling such as debug\nopen logs slow step etc and finally we\nhave reusable components\nthe user can create reusable components\nto publish them together as libraries\nnext we have the uipath robots\nall the automation tasks that created\nare run by uipath robots\nthere are two types of robots\nattended robots and unattended robots\nattended robots\nwork with you to speed up service desk\nand help desk it is used in activities\nwhere human involvement is the key\nunattended robots operate without human\ntouch maximizing cost and performance\nbenefits for any variety of back office\ntasks\nlastly\nwe have the uipath orchestrator\nthe orchestrator is like a centralized\nentity where you can deploy secure\nmanage all your automation tasks\nhere are the steps involved\nfirst\nyou create a bot now you create a\nproject and publish it as a process for\nfurther use\nonce a process is created it is assigned\nto a specific robot to execute in an\nenvironment\nthis collectively constitutes a job\nnow let's move on to the architecture of\nuipath\nso on the top\nyou have the client layer consisting of\nuipath studio and the uipath robot\nnow the uipath robot has two parts\none is the uipath agent service which\ndisplays all the available jobs in the\nsystem tree and the other one is the\nuipath executor service which is used to\nrun the jobs in one windows session\nthe server layer receives the robot once\nit is ready for execution with the help\nof the orchestrator\nyou can run the project on different pcs\nthe orchestrator monitors the deploys\nconfigures queue management and logging\nlastly we have the persistent layer\nwhich consists of the databases\nit takes care of the queues and holds\ninformation about the robot\nconfiguration and their assigned\nprocesses\nnow that we know what ui path is let's\nacquaint ourselves with its user\ninterface and understand its components\nbetter\nso this is what the typical interface\nlooks like\nfirst we have the ribbon\nit consists of three tabs\nhome design and debug\nhome is where you start a new project\nfrom pre-defined templates or open a\nproject you recently worked on by\ndefault the projects are created in the\nlocation shown below\nnext is the design tab\ndesign tab adds sequences flowcharts and\nstate machines to your project\nit installs and manages activity\npackages\nit builds interactions with ui elements\nand then publishes your work to\norchestrator\nfinally is debug\nit debugs your workflow while using\ndebugging tools to set up breakpoints\nmonitor the execution of activity step\nby step and adjust the debugging speed\nnext on the screen is tools\nso the tools tab can be used for\ninstalling extensions from chrome\nfirefox edge java silverlight citrix and\nwindows remote desktop and is also used\nfor launching the ui explorer and\nproject dependencies mass update tool\nthen we have settings\nthe settings tab has options for\nchanging the interface language\ntheme setting global preferences and\nmanaging activity feeds\nso you have general settings then there\nis settings for design locations managed\nresources and finally license and\nprofile\nup next you have help\nthe help tab directs you to product\ndocumentation release notes online\nresources the community forum and the\nrpa academy\nafter that\nyou have the recorder\nthe recorder component in uipath studio\nallows the user to record ui mouse\nmovements and keyboard activities to\ngenerate automation scripts\nafter that\nyou have scraping\nso ui path studio supports two types of\nscraping one is screen scraping and the\nnext one is data scraping\nso screen scraping is programmatic\ncollection of visual data and data\nscraping is the extraction of structured\ndata from an application\nthen you have user events\nuser events records events such as mouse\nclicks and keystrokes\nthen you have variables so variables\nhold different types of data\nthese variables can change over time\nuipath makes an easy provision to create\nand remove unused variables\non the bottom left you have project so\nthe project panel enables you to view\nthe components of the current project\nadd folders open the file location\nmanage dependencies and adjust project\nsettings\nbeside it\nyou have activities panel\nso the activities panel shows available\nactivities that can be added to the\ncurrent workflow\nusers can use the search box to find\nactivities navigate through them using\nnavigation keys and press\nyou also have the snippets panel which\nenables you to easily reuse automation\nit includes by default\nmultiple samples and snippets\nto the bottom right you have the\nproperties panel which is contextual and\nenables you to view and change the\nproperties of a selected activity\nyou also have the outline panel which\ndisplays the project hierarchy all\navailable variables and nodes\nyou can highlight activities in this\npanel by selecting them in the designer\npanel\nthe output panel enables you to display\nthe output of the log message or write\nline activities among other things\nexceptions for packages are also\ndisplayed in this panel\nso now that you have understood the\ninterface of uipath let's look at the\ncompanies using uipath\nso you have accenture capgemini\ncognizant ethos and deloitte to name a\nfew\nnow\nwe'll do a demo to automate a task using\nuipath studio\nso here is what we are going to do in\nthe demo\nwe will create an automated process to\nfetch data from a website wherein the\nbot would extract data like the name of\nthe person\nthe phone number and the email id\nthis data will store it in an excel\nsheet and send it over an email\nnow let's get started\nnow to do this demo\nwe'll be using the fake name generator\nwebsite to generate random data of\npeople and store this data set in an\nexcel sheet\nnow if i had to do this manually i would\nfirst create an excel sheet so let me\nopen an excel workbook\ni'll create a blank workbook\nso this is where i'll put my data if i\nhad to do it manually\nso now let me take you to\nthe fake name generator website\nso i'll search for\nfakenamegenerator.com\nso this is the website where you can\ngenerate\nfake names\nnow\nif i had to store this data in excel\ni would manually copy paste each and\nevery detail and paste it onto the excel\nsheet\nso for that\nfirst i had to create columns like name\nthen\nphone number\nand this in\nthe email\nafter that\ni had to come back\nto this\nand\ncopy each of these fields\nso name\nif i had to take the phone number\nso i would\ncopy this\nand similarly for the email address as\nwell\nfor one record it is fine\nwhat if you are asked to fetch 100\nrecords or say 200 records\nthen this method is not at all visible\nit is time consuming and inefficient\nyou need to find a way where you can\nautomate this task of fetching records\nui path is a solution for this\nso let's see how we can automate this\ntask using the uipath studio\nso i'll click on open\nmain workflow\nfirst\nwe need to direct ui path to go to the\nfake name generator website\nfor that\nwe need the sequence activity\nso let me search for sequence here\nso under activities\ni'll search for\nsequence\nand i'll drag it\nhere\nafter that\ni need to open the website in a web\nbrowser\nso for that\nlet me search for another activity\ncalled open browser\nso under activity\ni look for\nopen browser\nso i'll drag it on the sequence itself\nnow\nit is asking you to insert the url of\nthe website\nand it must be within double quotes\nso i'll go to my website\ncopy paste the url\nhave to give this url within double\nquotes then i'll paste it\nnow we need to select the name of the\nbrowser where you want to open this\nwebsite\nso under input and browser type\ni'll choose\nchrome\nnow let me go ahead and run this file\nso\nunder debug\ni have run file\ni'll click on it\nso as you can see the website is\nautomatically opened in a new window on\nchrome\ni'll close this\nthe next step in the process is to tell\nthe program how many records we want to\nfetch from the website\nfor this\nwe will create an input dialog box\nso\nunder activities\ni'll search for\ninput\nso here you get the input dialog box\ni'll drag and drop it on the top\nnow\nit is asking us to give the details so\ni'll\nput it within double quotes say enter\nthe\ndetails of customers\nor say\npeople\nand then here\ni'll give enter the\nnumber of\nrecords you want to fetch\nnow\nnow i have to store this information in\na variable\nso under variables\ni'll create a variable and name it as\ntotal\nis the total number of records i want to\nfetch\nsimilarly\nunder output result i will give the same\nvariable name as total\nnow we need to fetch the details a\nnumber of times repeatedly say for 10\ntimes or 20 times or 50 times\nto do this operation\ni will be using a do while loop\nso to use a do while loop\ni'll first search for\ndo while\nand i'll drop it to the\ndo section of the sequence\nas you can see\ndo while has two components\none is the body\nand the other one is condition\nthe body has the things that you want\nthe program to do\nthe condition is where you evaluate\ncertain conditions every time when the\nprogram has to do a task\nso for every step or iteration\nit will check if the condition is true\nor not\nand go inside the body of the loop\nnow for doing this\nwe need to assign a variable\nso\nlet's name the variable as\nval\nand i'll change the variable type to\ninteger\nand i'll make the scope\nto sequence\ni'll also assign a default value of 0.\nnow we'll compare this val to the\nvariable total\nso the condition i'll give is check\nif val is less than total\nso under condition\ni'll give val\nless than\ntotal so every time the value of val is\nless than the total\nit will keep fetching the records from\nthe website\nyou can see it has thrown some error\nnow this is\nbecause our total variable is of type\nstring while the val variable is of type\ninteger\nso you can't compare an integer\nwith a string variable\nso that would be absurd\nwe need to convert the total variable\nto an integer using the c and function\nso here itself i'll write\nc int which is convert this total\nvariable to integer\nyou can see the error is gone\nthe next thing i want to do is if the\nvalue of the valve variable is less than\ntotal i'll increment the value of val to\n1.\nso to do that\ni'll use an activity called assign\nso i'll check for\nassign\nand i'll drag it onto the body\nso here i'll give\nval\nequals to\nval\nplus 1\nthis will make sure the value of val\nincreases by 1 every time there is a new\nrecord inserted\nit will continue until the value of val\nno longer matches the total\nso the next job is to extract\ninformation from the website\nto do this\nwe will use the get full text activity\nso i'll search for get full text here\nand i'll\ndrag it right below the assign activity\nnow\nyou need to select the information which\nyou want\nso first i want to get the name\ni'll click on the indicate element\ninside browser\nand then select the name of the person\nso i'll click on this\nand\ni click on the name\nthere you go\nnow\nwe need to store this name in a variable\nso i'll create a variable\nso under variable i'll create\na variable called name\nand\nin the output also\ni'll give the same variable name\nnext\ni want to fetch the phone number of the\nperson\nso i'll again select get full text\nand i'll drag it\nhere\ni'll click on indicate element inside\nbrowser\nso i'll scroll down\nand i'll select the phone number of the\nperson\nso we have selected the phone number\nsimilarly i'll store this phone number\nin a variable\ni'll create a variable called\nphone underscore number\nand\nthe output text box also will\ngive the same variable\nas\nphone underscore number\nafter that\ni want to get the email address of the\nperson\nso i'll continue with the same drill\ni'll select the activity once again\nwhich is get full text and i'll drag it\nright here\ni'll click on indicate element inside\nbrowser\nand now\nwe'll select the email address which is\nthis one\nsimilarly\ni'll store the email address in a\nvariable called\nemail underscore id\nand in the output also we'll give the\nsame variable name which is email\nunderscore id\nnow\nwe need to store the names phone numbers\nand email ids into an excel sheet\nfor that we need to create a data table\nso i'll search for data table under\nactivities\nlet me go ahead and do that\nso i'll\nchoose build data table and drag it\nright below the input dialog box\nnow this table has to be assigned to a\nvariable\nso let me do that\nlet me give a variable name as\nfetch\nunderscore\ndata underscore table\nthe output also will give the same\nvariable name which is\nfetch underscore data underscore table\none thing i need to tell you here is\nwe change the variable type\nso i'll select browse for types\nand\nlook for data table\nwhich is\nsystem.data\ni'll drill down\nand search for data table which is this\none\nclick ok\nwe need to assign the column names to\nthis data table\nso let me now do that\ni'll\nuncheck all this and select the columns\nso you will give the first column name\nas\nname itself\nclick on ok\nselect one more column\ngive it as\nphone number\nclick ok\nand then\nwe need the email address\ni'll hit ok\nso we are done\nso first the data table is created and\nthen we'll write this data to an excel\nfile\nafter that\nwe need to create rows for the data\ntable\nfor that\ni will search for row\nunder activities\ni'll search for row\nand\ni'll select\nadd row\ni'll select add data row\ni'll place it right below where we have\ncreated all the variables\nnow i want to add a row for the name\nphone number and email address\nso under\ninput i'll select\narray row\ni'll expand this\nand within curly braces\ni'll give my variable names\nso those would be\nname\ngive a comma\nand then\nphone underscore number\ncomma\nemail\nunderscore id\nclick ok\ni made a mistake it should be within\ncurly braces\nokay\nnow to tell the table to which it should\nwrite the rows to we need to assign\nunder the data table name\nso under data table\ni'll give\nfetch underscore data underscore table\nfor every iteration a record will be\nadded to the table\nthen\nwe need to refresh the page to extract\nthe next set of information\nso for that\ni will add another activity called click\nand drop it right below the add data row\nso under activities\ni'll search for\nclick\nand i'll select\nmouse click\nand i'll drop it\nright\nbelow this one\nnow we need to indicate where do we want\nto click from the browser\nso\nclick on this\ngo on top\nand\nselect\ngenerate\nso we want to click on generate\nnext i will write the data to a csv file\nso i'll search for\nwrite csv under activities\nand\ni'll drop it towards the\nend of the sequence\nright here\nnow you need to give the location where\nyou want to place this file on your\nsystem\nand give the source from where it will\ntake the information\nso\nlet's give the location where you want\nto place this file\ni'll place it on my desktop itself\ni'll name this as\nfetch\nsave it\nand\nfor the source\ni'll give\nfetch underscore data underscore table\nwe are all set now let's run it\nso under debug file\ni'll select\nrun file\ni'll\nenter the number of records so let me\nfetch 10 records\nclick on ok\nnow this might take some time\ni believe it has run successfully now\nlet me check for my csv file\nthat should ideally be on my desktop\nthere you go so we have the csv file let\nme open it\nyou can see it has extracted\n10 rows of data\nand three columns namely\nname of the person the phone number and\nthe email address\nso we are done with the first task of\nautomatically generating data from a\nwebsite\nthe next task is to send this file\nover email\nnow to send an email\nyou need the smtp activity\nso under\nactivities i'll search for smtp\ni'll drag it right below here\nnow we need to configure this\ni'll be actually sending this email from\nsomeone else's email id to my email id\nso under 2\ni'll give my email address which is\nwithin quotes i'll type abhijit dot\nbiswal at\nsimplylearn.net\ni'll give a subject\nas\nautomatic\ndata\nextraction\nunder body i'll give something like hi\nplease find a test\nnow we have to attach the file\nwe have to give the location of the file\nhere\nso\nlet me go to\nproperties\nand\ni'll select this\ncancel\npaste this here\nfollowed by\nthe file name which is\nfetch\ndot csv\ni'll click on ok\nafter that\ni have to give the host port number\nwhich is 465\nand\nthe\nand the server name\nwhich is smtp\nunder log on\ni'll give the sender's email id\ni have to give the password as well\nunder the receiver it's my email id\nwhich is rbg.bushwhile simplyloan.net\nfor the sender i'll give the email ids\nchin my dot this pandey at\nsimplylearn.net\nand i'll give a dummy name\nschedule\nso we are almost done\nlet me now go to debug file and run this\nit is asking to enter the number of\nrecords i will give\n5\nclick on ok\nthis will take some time so let's just\nwait\nso we have successfully run our program\nnow let me check my inbox if i have got\nany mail from chinmay\nso there you go\ni have got this email\nand below you can see\nthe fetch.csv file attached and it has\nfive rows\nnow assuming you have a basic\nunderstanding of rpa let's go on and\ncompare the popularly used tools\nfirst up is trial version every tool\ngenerally offers a trial version for its\nusers to get acquainted with the tool\nthis helps the users understand the tool\nbetter and decide if they want to\nproceed with using the tool\nprism offers a free trial version\nit's available in two options either on\nthe cloud or on the local computer\nuipath also offers a free edition\nboth trial and license versions are\navailable\nautomation anywhere offers a free\ncommunity version and both tried and\nlicensed versions are available\nnext up is base technologies\nbase technologies define the technology\nwith which the software was built\nblue prism is based on c-sharp\nuipath is based on microsoft vendors\nlike sharepoint kibana and elastic\nsearch\nwhile automation anywhere is based on\nmodern java technologies\nthe third feature of comparison is\nprocess designer\nblue prism enables you to create design\nedit as well as test business processes\nfrom the visual business object\nnow a vbo is like an adapter provided by\nblue prism for communicating with an\napplication\neach visual business object implements a\nspecific set of operations on an\napplication's user interface\nso these are basically like objects that\nencapsulate a particular functional\nlogic\nuipath on the other hand acts as a\nvisual process designer with developer\nfriendly options\nnow a visual process designer is a\ndashboard consisting of various tools\nthrough which the developer can define\nthe automation tasks\nautomation anywhere is developer\nfriendly with a visual interface built\nfor business users along with advanced\nfeatures for developers\nbusiness users and developers can work\nside by side to build bots\nthey can see the visual interface and\ncode in a single screen\nthe next feature of comparison is\naccessibility\nblue prism offers browser based access\nonly ui path and automation anywhere on\nthe contrary offer both application\nbased and browser-based accessibility\nin case of automation anywhere the\ncontrol room can be accessed with a\nbrowser or a mobile application\nthis is the only platform where users\ncan create bots on any device or any\noperating system\nmoving on to the next feature\nlearning\nnow in case of blue prism the user\nshould have the necessary knowledge of\nprogramming you should be able to create\nbusiness objects\nand manage them in the control center\nui path enables you to design automation\nprocesses visually through diagrams the\ndeveloper need not know a programming\nlanguage in particular\nwhen it comes to automation anywhere it\nis developer friendly and offers both\nvisual and programming features\nbusiness users can build bots with the\nhelp of drag and drop features\nbeginners benefit from the built-in\nproduct walkthrough\nnext up is robots\nnow before we jump in let's discuss what\nthe different types of bots are\nthere are two types of quads we have the\nfront office boards whose deployment is\nin the user's control\nwe also have back office bots that can\nrun on locked machines from an\norchestrator the user may not be\nactively involved in its working\nso moving on to the comparison\nblue prism offers back office automation\nonly\nui path and automation anywhere offer\nboth front and back office automation\nin case of automation anywhere the hbc\nor the human bot collaboration feature\nenables humans and bots to work together\nto complete a task and also to manage\nexceptions and escalations\nmoving on the next feature is macro\nrecorder\nnow the macro recorder allows you to\nrecord keyboard activities and mouse\nevents to generate automation scripts\nthese activities are arranged based on\nthe order or sequence of actions being\nperformed on the screen\nso moving on to the comparison blue\nprism does not use a macro recorder\nuipath makes use of a mac2 recorder to\nenable fast process mapping automation\nanywhere offers a universal recorder so\nthat the user need not select different\nrecorders for different tasks\nmoving on to the next feature\narchitecture\nan application that runs on the client\nside and accesses the remote server for\ninformation uses a client server\narchitecture whereas an application that\nruns entirely on a web browser uses the\nweb architecture\nin case of a client server architecture\nthe user interaction with the server is\nalways through a user interface or\napplication on the client side\non the other hand in a web application\nthe user interaction is thoroughly\nthrough a web browser now blue prism and\nuipath both incorporate a client server\narchitecture\nautomation anywhere incorporates a cloud\nnative web-based microservices\narchitecture\nit is the only platform that provides a\ncomplete digital worker solution on the\nweb\nusers with any skill level can instantly\nstart building robots on a browser\nwithout any heavy installation\nthe next feature is accuracy\nblue prism is accurate for desktop web\nand citrix automation\nui path shines in citrix automation\ndesigned for bpo automation\nand automation anywhere shines in citrix\nautomation with ai sense technology\nwell any automation solution built using\na virtual desktop or built to work in\nvirtual desktops is called citrix\nautomation\nmoving on to the next feature\nreusability\nblue prism consists of a library of\nbusiness objects that can be reused\nacross multiple methods\nit also offers high reliability\nin the case of uipath the processes can\nbe used for various synthesis services\nwith several workflow modules\nas a result uipath offers a high degree\nof usability and moderate reliability\nin the case of automation anywhere apart\nfrom the standard common library users\ncan develop custom actions upload and\nmanage packages in their enterprise\ncontrol room\nevery bot created in automation anywhere\nis reusable\nthe bot store has hundreds of\npre-configured bots and digital workers\nto kick start a user's rpa journey\nnext up is pricing\nblue prism has a high cost of\nacquisition it also offers restricted\ntraining\nuipath offers effective pleasant\nentry-level pricing\nautomation anywhere offers attractive\nentry-level pricing\nits users also experience the lowest\ntotal cost of ownership because of its\nnative capabilities and web-based\narchitecture\nmoving on to the last feature\ncertifications\nblue prism offers several certifications\nlike blue prism professional developer\nblue prism rom architect among others\nui part provides free online training\nand certification programs like rpa\ndeveloper advanced certification\nautomation anywhere university offers\nfree online training and certification\nprograms for both students and advanced\npractitioners\nprofessionals can also avail job role\nspecific certifications\nthere are several rpa tools in the\nmarket today however blue prism\nautomation anywhere and uipath are\nleading the market\nfirst let's understand who an rpa\ndeveloper is\nnow generally speaking an rpa developer\nis someone who works cross-functionally\nwith business operations and business\nanalysts to create and optimize workflow\nprocesses\nnow however this is a relatively new\ncareer path and many organizations\nformal titles for rpa developers differ\nnow other similar positions may use\ntitles like process designer or\nautomation architect\nbut no matter the title the role of a\nsuccessful rpa developer requires\nspecific skills and best practices like\ndocumentation and planning\nnow in order to automate a business\nprocess an rpa developer will be\nrequired to create workflow diagrams and\nstrategically document the process prior\nto implementation\nnow he may also be responsible for\ntesting and bug fixes so coding skills\nare also important\nnow in order to become a successful rpa\ndeveloper you must have the ability to\nnavigate through appropriate\ntechnologies such as uipath or\nautomation anywhere\nhowever there are a few prerequisites to\nbecome an rpa developer\nwell it's not very hard but a little\nprep is necessary\nso let's go through them one by one\nfirst up is strategic planning\nnow planning is a critical phase in any\ndevelopment life cycle\nthe rpa developer regardless of the\ndesignation should possess the aptitude\nto ensure strategic planning\nstrategic planning basically includes\ndesign development and implementation of\nrpa systems\nthis also helps streamline the entire\nbusiness to optimize the efficiency\nnext up is analytical skills\nnow again as the name suggests it's\ncrucial to analyze the information and\nmake decisions to maximize your\nefficiency right now these are skills\nthat one develops when they're exposed\nto it so over a period of time you're\ngoing to develop these skills not to\nworry about it now\nnext up is problem solving skills now\nthese skills are again crucial to\npredict any potential outages and equip\nthe entire unit to overcome any\nunforeseen\ninterruptions from the business\nperspective as well problem solving\nskills play a significant role in\nensuring smooth conduction of tasks\nexperience in programming languages like\nsay c plus plus c python ruby java is\nalso crucial\nnext up is hands-on experience and rpe\ntools and cognitive platforms like blue\nprism automation anywhere redwood open\nspan etc\nnow other general skills include\ncommunication skills as well\nnow this is pivotal for any organization\nnow the developer should be outspoken\nand should articulate new ideas\nnow that you're familiar with the skills\nrequired let's look at the job\ndescription for an rpa developer and\nsome of his responsibilities\nso here's a screenshot of the job\nadvertisement posted by ibm\nas mentioned some of the\nresponsibilities include crafting\nautomation process solutions coding and\nscripting in any of the automation tools\nconfiguring new automation using core\nautomation tools communicating with\nbusiness analysts and clients building\nand documenting the best procedures\nsupporting the operational teams during\nany rollout phases\nsupporting existing processes and\nimplementing change requirements\nand successfully managing any sort of\nissues so if you're aspiring to become\nan rpa developer then these are some of\nthe job responsibilities that you will\nhave to readily take\nup if you're still wondering if this\nfield has scope for development in the\ncoming years let me clarify it for you\nso let's go ahead and look at the rpa\ngrowth projections and salary\naccording to gartner robotic process\nautomation software grew up by 63 in\n2018 making it the fastest growing\nsegment of the global enterprise\nsoftware market\nnow the growth curve has also been\nsteadily increasing since 2016 and\ncontinues beyond 2020.\nnow it is also predicted that rpa will\ntouch more than 230 million knowledge\nworkers which constitute up to say nine\npercent of the global workforce\nnow any company which is labor intensive\nwhere people are performing high volume\nhigh transaction functions can totally\nbenefit from rpa\nso if you're still skeptical about\npicking up rta i hope this clarified it\nfor you\nso moving on to salaries in the u.s the\naverage sanity of an rpa developer is\naround 76 000 us dollars\nthe average size of an rpa developer in\nindia is around 6 lakh rupees per annum\nso the companies that are greatly hiring\nfor rpa developers are ibm capgemini\nemphasis volvo and accenture among\nothers\nmoving on here are a few tips to\nkickstart your rpa career\nso let's go ahead and look at them one\nby one\nfirst up is to choose your rpa platforms\nnow all rpa tools have graphical user\ninterface or guis\nbut it's really helpful to understand\nthe underlying technology now this comes\nin extremely handy when the developer\nhas to create more complex c\npersonalized or advanced bots\nso if you are a python developer then\nyou can start off by working with argos\nlabs so this allows the developers to\nbuild plugins with almost no effort from\nthe existing python code\nso if you're a python developer then you\ncan start off by working with argos labs\nnow this really allows developers to\nbuild plugins with literally no effort\nand if you're a dot net developer then\nyou can start off with ui path or\nautomation anywhere's community\nadditions\nso if you're a java developer then you\ncan start off with automation anywhere\nand if you're a developer with no\nexperience then you can begin with any\nof the leading rpa providers\nnow tip number two is to start building\nthere are plenty of free materials and\nguides to help you begin your rpa\njourney so some of the famous or\nwell-known rpa tools are blue prism work\nfusion ui path automation anywhere etc\nso just start working on them\ntip number three is build your github\nrepository\nno matter how small or simple you think\nyour project is go ahead and put it on\nyour github repository this totally adds\ncredibility to your profile even if\nyou're attending interviews one look at\nyour github repository is going to make\nthem realize how good of a developer you\nare\ntip number four is to take up\nfreelancing projects\nnow again to start off you can take up\nsay non-paid or even low paid projects\nsome of the websites that you could look\nup are up work freelancer troll answer\npeople per hour\nso tip number five is to start a blog\nnow having your own blog will add\ncredibility to your profile\nno matter how less you've worked on any\nprojects you can go ahead and type in\nall the information you want recruiters\ncan also have a glance at your profile\nyou're definitely going to get some\nextra points for this\ntip number six is to ensure you update\nyour resume and profile now keep your\nresume and profiles updated on all job\nportals like linkedin indeed simply\nhired and monster\nso these were some simple tips to help\nyou become an rpa developer now that\nwe've established that rpa has a steep\ngrowth curve let's look at the rpa job\nroles that you should look out for\nwe have the rpa developer\nsenior rpa developer\nrpa process architect\nrp developer senior consultant\nproject manager\nlead developer\nbusiness analyst and rpa data analyst\nnow these job roles come with specific\nresponsibilities depending on the\ndesignation\nhowever there are a few common\nresponsibilities of an rpa developer\nlet's go ahead and check them out\nnow the first one is strategic planning\nskills now planning is a crucial phase\nin any development life cycle the rpa\ndeveloper regardless of the designation\nshould possess the aptitude to ensure\nstrategic planning\nplanning includes the design development\nand implementation of rpa systems\nthis also helps streamline the business\nnext up is strong analytical skills now\nto understand the client's requirements\nand cater to the needs accordingly is\ncrucial\nanalytical skills are also important to\npredict or identify potential bugs and\nerrors and rectify them\nnow this scale is especially required if\nyou're involved in the overall\ndevelopment\nnext we have strong problem solving\nskills now this again is extremely\ncrucial to predict any outages and equip\nthe entire unit to overcome any\nunforcing interruptions from the\nbusiness perspective as well problem\nsolving skills play a significant role\nin ensuring smooth conduction of tasks\nexperience in any programming language\nsuch as c c plus plus python ruby java\nor dot net is also important\nhands-on experience in rpa tools and\ncognitive platforms such as blue prism\nautomation anywhere ui path open span\netc is necessary\ncommunication skills are pivotal for any\norganization the developer should be\noutspoken and articulate any new ideas\nyou should also be confident to raise\nconcerns and be as transparent as\npossible in the long run this only\nproves to be helpful to the organization\nlastly we have exposure to sql now\nexperience with database be it sql or\nnosql is highly preferred it's always an\nadded advantage if you have the\nknowledge about accessing and managing\ndatabases\nnext up we have rpa developer salaries\nnow the salaries will differ depending\non the location your experience and also\nthe designation\nnow in the u.s here are the job salaries\nand the roles\naccording to glassdoor an rpa developer\nin the us earns around 76 000 us dollars\nper year\nthe nrp developer senior consultant\nearns around 99 000 us dollars per year\nan rpa process architect earns an\naverage salary of 95 000 us dollars and\na senior rpa developer earns an average\nsalary of 92 000 us dollars\nan rpa project manager earns around 73\n000 us dollars per annum an rpa lead\ndeveloper earns an average salary of 99\n000 us dollars per annum an rpa business\nanalyst earns around 68 000 us dollars\nper annum and the data analyst earns\naround 62 000 us dollars per annum\nmoving on to india the average salary of\nan rpa developer is around 5 lakhs 98\n000 rupees\nthat of a senior consultant a senior rp\ndeveloper and an rpa lead developer is\naround 14 lakhs per annum\nand the average salary of an rpa\nbusiness analyst is around 5 lakhs 40\n000 rupees\nnow let me quickly run you through a\nsample resume of an rpa developer now\nthis is just a template and you can\nalter it according to your needs\nfirst up is your general information\nlike name phone number and your email id\nthen you can give a quick description\nabout yourself and your strengths you\ncan also mention the objective as to why\nyou're applying and what you're looking\nfor in the organization\nyou can include your linkedin profile\nlink and your github link one look at\nyour linkedin profile is enough for\nanybody to gather all the information\nnecessary so make sure that it's updated\nmoving on you could mention your\nexperience now here you would have to\nmention the names of your previous\norganizations along with your\ndesignation and the tenure\nyou could also include your key\nresponsibilities in these organizations\nalong with your responsibilities you\ncould also mention the awards that you\nreceived in your organizations\nnext up is your educational background\nyou can mention the university that you\ngraduated from and is required that you\nhave a degree in computer science you\ncan also go ahead and mention your gpa\nthe next section is skills now this is\npretty crucial in the technical skills\nsection you could mention about\ndifferent rpa tools that you've worked\non if you're good at a particular\nprogramming language go ahead and\nmention that as well\nas mentioned earlier any experience in\ndatabase management is an added\nadvantage\nif you have any experience go ahead and\nmention that moving on to non-technical\nskills you could mention any\nextracurricular activities that you're\nproud of some soft skills that you feel\nworth mentioning can be added in this\nsection mentioning the languages that\nyou know can also boost your resume\nnow given all this it's fundamental that\nyou do not lie on your resume in today's\nvideo we're going to discuss the top rpa\ninterview questions\nnow if you're looking to make a career\nin this field and if you're just\nbrowsing around for jobs then you're in\nthe right place this video will\nabsolutely help you crack that next\ninterview of yours so without further\nado let's begin\nthe first question is what is rpa\nnow robotic process automation is the\nuse of software with artificial\nintelligence and machine learning\ncapabilities to handle high volume\nrepetitive tasks that previously\nrequired humans to perform now some of\nthese tasks could be addressing queries\nmaking calculations maintenance of\nrecords or even performing transactions\nnow rpa is a form of automation that\nbasically sticks to the front end of the\nsystem and carries out tasks without\nhaving to move to the back end now this\nis an essential feature of rpa\nnext up is mention a few applications of\nrpa\nthere are several applications to\nmention a few we have open mails and\nattachments fill in forms and move files\nand folders\nfollow if then rules connect to system\napis extract structured data from\ndocuments make complex calculations\nmonitor manual processes and learn how\nto perform them\nread and write databases scrape data\nfrom documents and even log into web\nenterprise applications\nnext question is mention a few\nadvantages of rpa\nfirstly rpa reduces cost now by\nautomating tasks the cost saving of\nalmost 30 can be achieved through rpa\nrpa reduces operational risks various\ncompanies prefer to outsource busy work\nto external parties now this comes with\nan inherent risk of human errors and\ninefficiency now rpa brings forth a\nbetter solution and since work stays\nin-house there's less operational risk\nnext up is quality and accuracy rpa\noffers services to processes with a high\nprobability of human errors thereby\nincreasing accuracy robots are reliable\nand consistent and don't complain when\nexpected to work tirelessly\nnext up is scalability with the help of\nrpa companies can make adjustments based\non seasonality and can easily scale up\nor down the operation as needed\nreduced workload automating tasks like\nreport making can significantly reduce\nthe workload on the employee allowing\nthem to focus on other critical tasks\nimproved customer satisfaction since\naccuracy is maintained and operational\nrisk is minimal customers are provided\nwith quality content\nlastly we have improved business results\nsince all employees are focusing on\nactivities that add more value to the\ncompany improved results in the business\nare visible\nthe next question is what are some\nindustries that can benefit from rpa\nthere are several industries and domains\nthat are currently benefiting from rpa\nto mention a few there's banking and\nfinance iit integration processes human\nresources insurance agencies marketing\nand sales and customer relationship\nmanagement\nmoving on to next question what are rpa\ntools\nnow to meet the objectives of rpa rpa\ntools are used\nthey are the software with the help of\nwhich one can configure tasks and build\nbots to automate them\nsome of the popular ones in the market\ntoday are ui path blue prism automation\nanywhere work fusion and redwood\nmoving on to next question explain the\nworking of rpa\nnow the typical working of rpa includes\nfour crucial stages\nthe first stage is planning in this\nstage the processes to be automated are\ndefined which includes identifying the\ntest objects finalizing the\nimplementation approach and defining a\nclear roadmap for the rpa implementation\nthe next step is design and development\nin this phase you start developing the\nautomation workflows as per the agreed\nplan\nthirdly we have deployment and testing\nthis phase typically includes the\nexecution of the bots any unexpected\noutages are to be taken care of during\nthe deployment to ensure accurate\nfunctioning testing of these bots for\nbugs and errors is crucial\nlastly we have support and maintenance\nproviding constant support helps in\nidentifying and rectifying the errors\nbetter\nmoving on to the next question what is\nthe difference between traditional\nautomation and rpa\nhere's a simple image for you\nnow to go on to talk about the\ndifferences\ntraditional automation involves\nprogramming apis and integration tools\nto integrate different systems\nrp on the other hand mimics the actions\nof a user at the user interface level in\nthe case of traditional automation the\ndeveloper needs to have a good\nunderstanding of the target system while\nin rpa as long as the bot can exactly\nfollow the steps the developer need not\nworry about the underlying complexities\nthe next question is mention the types\nof rpa\nnow basically there are three types of\nrpa\nfirst up is unattended or autonomous rpa\nnow this is ideal for reducing work like\ncompleting data processing tasks in the\nbackground they do not require any human\nintervention\nnow these bots can be launched at\nspecific intervals or they could be\nbought initiated or they could be\ntriggered by some data input next up is\nattended rpa now these bots live on the\nuser's machine and are triggered by the\nuser\nthey can be launched when embedded on an\nemployee's device or they can be\nautonomous based on certain conditions\nor they can be launched using the rpa\nclient tool\nlastly we have hybrid rpa it has a\ncombination of attended and autonomous\nbots now these bots address front and\nback office tasks in the enterprise\nthe next question is what are front and\nback office spots\nnow front office bots are those whose\ndeployment is totally in the user's\ncontrol they require human intervention\nthey work from the same desktop as that\nof the user it can only be triggered by\nlocal machines manually and cannot run\nremotely\nwhen it comes to back office boards\nthese bots can run on locked machines\nfrom the orchestrator\nthe user may not be actively involved in\nits working and these bots can be\ntriggered remotely by servers\nthe next question is what are some\nfeatures of rpa\nfirst up is rich analytical suite now\nrpa monitors and manages automated\nfunctions from a central console\nnow this console can be accessed from\nanywhere and offer basic metrics on\nrobots servers workflows and more\nsimple creation of bots\nrpa tools allow quick creation of bots\neffortlessly by capturing mouse clicks\nand key strokes with built-in screen\nrecorder components\nscriptless automation\nrpa tools are code free and can automate\nany application in any department\nemployees with less programming skills\ncan create bots through guis\nsecurity\nrpa tools enable the configuration as\nwell as customization of encryption\ncapabilities for securing certain data\ntypes to defend against the interruption\nof network communication\nhosting and deployment rpa systems can\nautomatically deploy bots in groups of\nhundreds hence rpa can be installed on\ndesktops and deployed on servers to\naccess data for repetitive tasks\ndebugging some rpa tools required to\nstop running to rectify the errors while\nother tools allow dynamic interaction\nwhile debugging this is one of the most\npowerful features of rpa\nmoving on\nwhat are the major differences between\nblue prism and uipath\nmoving on to the first feature is trial\nversion\nblue prism offers a trial version it's\navailable in two options either on cloud\nor on the local computer ui path on the\nother hand offers free edition both\ntrial and license versions are available\nmoving on to base technologies blue\nprism is completely based on c-sharp ui\npath is based on sharepoint kibana and\nelasticsearch\nmoving on to process designer blue prism\nallows you to create design edit as well\nas test business processes from the\nvisual business object\nbut what exactly is a vbo\na vbo can take the form of a set of\ncoded functions which may be written in\nvb.net or csharp.net\nuipath acts as a visual process designer\nwith friendly developer options now a\nvisual process designer basically is a\ndashboard consisting of various tools\nthrough which a developer can define the\nautomation tasks\nmoving on to accessibility blueprism\nallows only browser-based accessibility\nuipath on the other hand provides mobile\nand browser accessibility\nmoving on to robots blueprism offers\nback-office automation only while uipath\noffers both front and back office\nautomation\nthe next crucial factor is a macro\nrecorder\nin case of blue prism a macro recorder\ndoes not exist\nwhile in the case of uipath it consists\nof a macro recorder enabling faster\nprocess mapping\nmoving on what is citrix automation\nany automation solution\nbuilt using a virtual desktop or built\nto work in virtual desktops is citrix\nautomation\nit plays a major role in small to\ncorporate companies like bpo and contact\ncenters where applications are being\naccessed remotely because of security\nconsiderations\nnext question is what is uipath studio\nnow uipath studio is basically a\nplatform to create the automation bots\nit encompasses hundreds of activity\ntemplates and ready-made components to\ndrag and drop\nui path studio consists of first up is\ngui dashboard it offers a visual\ndashboard with activities like send\nemail display message and so on\nit also consists of different types of\nrecorders uipath studio offers various\nrecorders to record actions on multiple\nplatforms\nnext up is logging and exception\nhandling it offers various options for\nthese two such as debug open logs slow\nstep etc\nlastly it offers reusable components\nhere the user can create usable\ncomponents to publish them together as\nlibraries\nmoving on what are activities in uipath\nthe activities panel shows available\nactivities that can be added to the\ncurrent workflow users can use the\nsearch box to find various activities\nnavigate through them using navigation\nkeys and press\nsystem activities pack contains all the\nbasic activities used for creating\nautomation projects these activities\nenable the robots to manipulate data\ntables by adding or extracting\ninformation or directly interact with\ndirectories and files on your machine\nperforming any action a human user would\nalso there are other types of activities\nin the pack that aid in the creation and\nexecution of automation projects\nthemselves such as logical operators and\nexpressions\nmoving on what is a sequence in ui path\na sequence is a simple linear\nrepresentation that flows from top to\nbottom and defines which activities are\nto be performed\nall right you can see a simple example\non your screen here\nso to give you a detailed explanation\nlet me just navigate to ui path\nand here i can create a new sequence i\ngo to new click on sequence\nand let me call it sequence as it is and\nsay create\nall right now a sequence is created so i\nwant to display two messages so let's\nlook for the activity that is message\nbox\ni drag and drop it here\nand let me display hello first\nand i drag another message box and after\nthat i drop it here and\nokay let me do that again\nall right and here i display welcome\nall right\nso let's save this and debug\naccording to the logic hello has to be\ndisplayed first and then welcome right\nso let's go ahead and see if it does\nthat\nall right you see a hello message first\nfollowed by which you can see the\nwelcome message\nso this is what a sequence is\nmoving on to the next question\nwhat is scraping in uipath\nnow scraping can be done in two ways\nfirst up is data scraping now this is a\ntechnique with the help of which\nstructured data can be extracted from\nthe web or any application and saved to\na database or a spreadsheet or a dot csv\nfile\nin the case of screen scraping it is a\nprocess of collecting screen display\ndata from one application and\ntranslating it so that another\napplication can display it\nnow you can see the two options on the\ntop of your user interface in ui path\nmoving on\nwhat are uipath robots\nnow uipath's robots run the automation\nthat is created using the uipath studio\nnow there are two types of robots as\ndiscussed earlier we have attended\nrobots now they work with you to speed\nup the process like service desk\noperation or help desk operations now it\nis used in activities where human\ninvolvement is key\nnext up is unattended robots now these\noperate without the human touch\nmaximizing cost and performance benefits\nfor any variety of back office tasks\nnext question\nwhat does a uipath orchestrator do\nnow the orchestrator is a centralized\nrobot management dashboard where you can\neasily deploy secure and manage your ui\npath robots at scale\nfirst you have to create the bot\nthe project is then published as a\nprocess for further use once a process\nis created it is assigned to a specific\nrobot to execute in an environment this\ncollectively constitutes a job\nall of this is taken care of by the\nuipath orchestrator\nnext question how is exceptional\nhandling achieved in uipath\nexception handling is one of the error\nhandling methods in uipath the error\nhandling activity has four options\nfirst up is read through now using this\nactivity a robot throws an exception\nagain which was previously caught while\nexecuting the workflow\nfor this activity we don't need to\nprovide any specified message\nsecondly we have terminate workflow now\nthis is a mechanism where we can ask the\nrobot to terminate rest activities\nthis activity is mostly used when there\nis no data to process\nto use this activity we may need to\nprovide the exception message which the\nbot may login the error rock file which\nwe can refer to later\nthird is throw through activity is a\nmechanism wherein if a bot fails to\nexecute a mentioned activity it throws\nan error with a specified error message\nto help us understand better\nlastly we have try catch now this\nactivity has three parts the try block\nwould be executed and if there was an\nerror it will be caught in the catch\nsection\nnow after executing the try block robot\nwill execute the finally block in any\ncondition\nmoving on what are break points in\nuipath\nbreakpoints are used to purposely pause\nthe debugging process on any activity\nthat may trigger execution issues\nyou can place and modify a breakpoint on\nany of the activities as follows\nso from the context menu you can right\nclick on an activity and select toggle\nbreakpoint so let me show you how that\nworks\nso here in my sequence i can just right\nclick on it\nand here you can see the toggle\nbreakpoint option you can go ahead and\nclick on that that is one of the methods\nor i can select the activity and click\non the breakpoints button on the debug\ntab so let me show you\nhere let me select this\nand in my debug tab\ni can click on breakpoints and say\ntoggle breakpoint\nthat is another method and lastly i can\npress f9 while the desired activity is\nbeing selected\nit's as simple as that\nmoving on to the next question what is a\nmacro recorder\na macro recorder allows you to record\nmouse events and keyboard activities to\ngenerate automation scripts\nnow the activities are arranged based on\nthe sequence of actions being performed\non the screen right so this sequence is\nsaved in your workflow which you can\nlater use it to play back the recorded\naction\nmoving on what are the user events in\nuipath mention a few\nnow user events and uipath specify the\nactions performed due to the occurrence\nof certain events right some of these\nevents could be click key press or\nmonitor mouse or any monitor keyboard\netc\nso when it comes to on click element now\nthis basically monitors all the click\nevents on a specified ui element the\nmouse buttons left right and middle are\nused for the click action\nby default the left mouse button is\nselected\non prepress element now this monitors\nkeyboard events on a specified ui\nelement\nspecial keys are supported and you can\nselect them from the activity drop down\nlist this field supports only strings\nand string variables\non click image this monitors the image\ndefined by the target ui element for\nmouse input\nand monitor mouse this monitors a\nspecified mouse key combination\nsystem-wide event\nmoving on\nwe have what are the different\nactivities performed by uipath\nwe have core activities for automation\nprocesses\ncognitive activities for language\ntranslations credential activities for\nenabling the addition or deletion of\ncredentials database activities\nbasically used for executed queries\ntransactions etc we have excel\nactivities for automating ms excel tasks\nftp activities for performing functions\non the ftp server\nintelligent ocr activities for\ndigitization and scraping we have mail\nactivities for working with imap pop3\nsmtp outlook\nwe have pdf activities for data\nextraction from pdf\npython activities for invoking python\nscripts and methods\nterminal activities for retrieving data\nfrom the terminal we have web activities\nfor performing soap and http requests to\nany web apis and their word activities\nfor automating activities in ms word\nso these are the few you could mention\nmoving on what does the control room in\nautomation anywhere do\nthe control room is a web-based platform\nthat controls automation anywhere all\nright the control room deals with user\nmanagement source control\ni mean the code for the bots is managed\nby the control room\ndashboard it gives complete analytics\nand results of automation anywhere bots\nand license management the purchased\nlicenses for automation anywhere\nconfigured in the control room now there\nare two types of licenses in automation\nanywhere you have the device license\nwhich allows you to create a bot edit\nbot and then run a bot and you have the\nrun license where the user can only run\nthe bot and cannot make any changes\nso this is what the control room does\nmoving on to the next question what is a\nbot runner\nnow a bot runner is the machine where\nyou run the bot now you could have\nmultiple bots running in parallel you\nonly need the run license to run the\nbots\nthe bots will report back the execution\nlogs pass fail status back to the\ncontrol room\nmoving on what are task bots meta bots\nand iq boards\nso task bots basically are the bots that\nautomate a rule-based repetitive task in\nareas like documentation administration\nhr claims management etc\nmoving on to meta bots these bots are\nthe automation building blocks it is\ndesigned in such a way that with\napplication changes or updates you need\nto make minimal edits to this board any\nchanges made to the bot is easily\nreflected\nlastly we have the iqbots now this is an\nadvanced tool it can learn on its own\nand perform a task according to it iq\nbots offer automation using highly\nadvanced cognitive technology\nmoving on is robotic process automation\nsimilar to screens keeping or macros\nnow screen scraping mostly talks about\nthe old green screen applications\nmainframe ones where you basically\ncapture the screen\nyou process it based on its content and\ninformation that you have\nwhen it comes to rpa it is more\nintelligent\nmore capable and much more robust\nwhat it does it connects to the elements\nwhether they have windows applications\nor java applications does not matter\nthey connect all the elements it does\nuse screen scraping yes but it's just a\npart of robotic process automation\nthey're not entirely the same\nmoving on what are thick and thin\nclients\na thick client is the application that\nrequires certain attribute features\nusing rpa tools example a computer a\ncalculator or internet explorer\nwhile a thin client is the application\nthat never requires the specific\nproperties while using the rpe tools\nvery simple\nthe next question is how is a chatbot\ndifferent from rpa\nnow a chatbot is basically a bot that is\nprogrammed to chat with the user like a\nhuman being would right while in case of\nrta it is a bot that is programmed to\nautomate a manual business process of\nexecuting a task or any activity with a\nbusiness function\nall right so a chatbot can be used as a\nmedium to feed input to the rpa board\nbut it cannot replicate the features of\nan rpa system\nmoving on to the final question can\nselenium be used for rpa\nwell there are lots of test automation\ntools in the market today like selenium\nqtp and apm these are good test\nautomation tools and no they cannot be\nused for robotic process automation test\nautomation tools have a constraint they\nrequire software in order to run\nbut in case of rpa it can be applied to\nanything other than a product\nand mostly rpa is used to automate\nbusiness processes\nso selenium or any test automation tool\nfor that matter cannot be used for rpa\nso with that we come to the end of this\ncrash course i hope it helped you we'll\nbe back with more videos
