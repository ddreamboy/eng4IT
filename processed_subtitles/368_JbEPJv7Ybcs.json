  "text": "yeah i would just suggest the it\nfundamentals that's what you should\nlearn all right so if you're an\nindividual who wants to get started in\nthe it or cyber security industry and\nyou're wondering where should i start or\nwhat should i learn before in today's\nvideo topic i will be addressing my\npersonal opinion on what you should\nlearn why you should learn what you\nshould learn and where you should learn\n[Music]\nalright so by now you should know it's\nthe ic fundamentals that's what i think\nyou should learn you can go ahead and\nclick off this video but if you want a\nlittle bit more detail you can continue\non what exactly are the it fundamentals\nwell in my opinion they outline a few\ndifferent surrounding categories\nincluding hardware which are the\nphysical parts of a computer and\ncomputing devices you have the software\nwhich is a suite of tools and data which\nyou know tell the computer how to work\nincluding operating systems software\napplications and more so think about\nlike a windows 10 or linux then you have\nnetworking which is the exchange and\ntransportation of data between computing\ndevices so understanding how that works\napplications which is computer software\nor programs used to carry out specific\ntasks you know such as word processing\nor editing or email clients and then you\nhave the security basics my favorite\nright understanding the added elements\non top of the listed uh elements or\ncategories that i just\noutlined now i personally believe if you\nstarted from the very beginning you're\ngoing to set yourself up for a better\nsuccess and i'll tell you that reason in\na moment now while learning the it\nfundamentals it's important to keep in\nmind some essential concepts and skills\nrequired within the it industry and this\nincludes skills such as configuring and\ntroubleshooting\n[Music]\njust like anything that you learn in\nschool you gotta first understand the\nbasics of course you could just throw\nyourself deep into the woods and have no\nidea what's going on and maybe yes you\ncould complete the problem but let's\njust say you want to complete some\ncomplex math equation well you have to\nknow the basics of the symbols\nsubtraction addition such as this nice\ncomplex math equation i think you\ni don't know how to do this\nyou know those or if you want to get a\nlittle spicy and you want to mix some\nelements together you got to know the\nperiodic table i think i don't really\nknow i'm not a chemistry major well the\nsame goes for it in my opinion you get\nthe point now sure you could provision a\nkali linux vm and you could use john\nripper and start cracking those facebook\npasswords don't actually do that or you\nknow you can throw yourself deep into\nthe woods of a project and sometimes\nthat method works but the question\nbecomes if you have no technological or\nany i.t skills background how do you\nknow you know what to secure in the\ncontext of cyber security if you don't\neven know how the technology tool\nprinciple concept works right if you\ncan't understand what a layer 2 switch\ndoes from you know a high level overview\nhow do you know you're going to need to\napply port security you know in the\ncontext of a layer 2 switch well you\nwon't know because you don't know how a\nlayer 2 switch works in the high level\nand that's why i suggest the it\nfundamentals it's great way to get the\nbasics down you can build those\nfoundational skills and then you can\nthrow yourself into the woods of you\nknow kali linux if you want to\n[Music]\nthere are hundreds of resources out\nthere both free and affordable alright\none moment of self promo you can skip to\nthis time stamp if you don't care about\nthis but there are free courses i have\nout there one is on udemy it's a\ncomplete introduction to cyber security\nright so this is going to be a very high\nlevel overview of cyber security in i.t\nand we address some of the very basics\nsuch as\nhardware and networking devices so why\nnot just give away the course for free\nif you're watching this in the next\nthree days of this upload you can go\nsign up for it\nfor free but i do also have another\ncourse it's more of a very much so\npractical hands-on course that i had\nreleased last year and i added some a\nfew updates to it this is a great course\nto get started and now enough for the\ncell promo all right so some platforms\ninclude free code cam they have a plenty\nof crash courses out there udemy has\nplenty of basic it courses you have\nplenty of youtube crash courses i'll\nleave some that i think are noteworthy\nincluding ones that are released from\ngoogle itself which is a great way to\nstart a humble bundle which is a book\nprovider in the form of ebooks that you\ncan see and find if there are any\nbundles out there one more thing to note\nand that is three is a great place to\nstart with my beginners course it's a\nlot of theory not so much practical or\nhands-on you gotta get started with\nunderstanding the concepts\nbut\none thing to note is to have a hands-on\npractical approach once you've maybe\nstarted some of those basics i have a\nresources page with a complete list of\nprojects you can just check out it's all\nfree you don't have to worry about\npaying\nand you can just look at the different\nresources project ideas and how to go\nabout solving those projects on that\nwebsite this video has been short i hope\nit's been useful and helpful i did this\nvideo a few years ago and i thought i\nwould go ahead and provide an update for\n2021 so i hope everything is well and\nuntil the next video have a good day\n",
