  "text": "Hello and welcome to dimensionality reduction.\nMy name is Alex Cayco Gajic. I'm a junior professor at the group for neural theory at ENS in Paris,\nand I'm interested in how the cerebellum contributes to motor control especially using techniques from population coding and statistical learning.\nBefore jumping in to the lectures,\nI want to give a brief overview of the tutorials that you'll encounter today. In the first tutorial,\nYou'll learn to conceptualize multivariate data from a geometric point of view.\nThis is going to be very useful for understanding how principal component analysis works, which is the topic of the second tutorial.\nBoth of these are going to use toy data that is two-dimensional and that's really going to be very useful for building your intuition.\nIn the third tutorial, you will use PCA for dimensionality reduction in high dimensional data.\nAnd then in the final tutorial, you will learn a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique called t-SNE.\nBut let's jump right into a geometric view of data.\nMultivariate means many variables and as scientist when we perform an experiment and make many observations,\nessentially what we're doing is collecting samples of many variables that we're observing through the experiment.\nI'm going to keep returning to the example of a neural recording. So in this case, each Xi\nrepresents the firing rate of a particular neuron,\nfrom the whole population of neurons that you're recording from.\nYou could also imagine that each Xi could represent a behavioral variable for a particular behavioral task.\nSo at each time point in the experiment,\nyou will collect a new vector corresponding to the firing rates of all of these neurons. And,\nhow do you represent all this data? One way is to just stack all of the vectors together into the data matrix X.\nIn this matrix, each row\nCorresponds to a single sample of all of the variables. So all of the firing rates of all neurons at a single time point.\nAnd each column\ncorresponds to all of the samples of a single variable so X3 would be the\nfiring rates for neuron 3 at all time points in your experiment.\nAnother way to represent this data is as a point in a high dimensional vector space.\nThis can be described by the coordinate axes each of which represents the firing rates for a different neuron.\nI'm going to focus on the 2-dimensional case for the sake of visualization.\nWhen you collect multiple samples from your experiment,\nthen you will get multiple data points, which will lie on different locations in this\nvector space and that's because there is typically a lot of variability in neural data. But there's different flavors of variability, and\none possibility is you may see data that looks like this so this is an example of uncorrelated\ndata, where the variability of neuron 1 is pretty much the same as the variability of neuron 2.\nOn the other hand, you might see uncorrelated data where one neuron has much higher variability than the other neuron.\nso in this case, you can see that the\ndirection of most of the variance of the data is\nalong the axis corresponding to neuron 1.\nOn the other hand, you might see that your data is very correlated. And in this case notice that the direction\ncorresponding to most of the variance in the data is\naligned neither with neuron 1's coordinate axis nor with axis of neuron 2.\nEssentially the goal of PCA is to find this direction.\nSo to give you the really big picture view of the message for today:\nTypically in neural data, even when we're recording from very large numbers of neurons. We don't observe\nthat the neural activity patterns\nare\nuniformly distributed across\nthe entire vector space of possible activity patterns.\nUsually we see that they are constrained to lie on a lower dimensional subspace,\nand the goal of PCA is to find this low dimensional subspace by looking for directions of\nmaximum variance in the data. But before we can\nunderstand how this really works, we'll work on developing our intuition for a geometric view of data.\n",
