  "text": "everyone it seems is doing agile\ndevelopments but the truth is that many\norganizations don't have a firm grasp on\nthe process of agile software\ndevelopment even if you think you're\ndoing agile development you may not be\ndoing agile development is a lot like\nrunning a restaurant everyone has their\nown specific tasks but they have to work\ntogether so all the pieces come together\nat the right time and they have to be\nable to make all sorts of meals based on\nwhatever customers happen to want each\nday the team is only successful when the\nproduct is satisfactorily delivered to\nthe customer the process in a restaurant\nstarts with the food orders the server\ncollects the orders on tickets that the\nkitchen then works through in software\ndevelopment business units ask for the\nproducts they want developed providing\ntheir user stories and requirements in\nother words their order tickets the\nagile team has to take all those tickets\nand figure out how to make all the\nproducts so that they all get delivered\nat the right time to the various\nbusiness teams that's called the Kanban\nprocess based on the Japanese word\nKanban for the tickets to used in\nproject planning the scrum master in\nconsultation with the product owner and\ndevelopment team organizes the tickets\ninto groups that can be tackled at once\nthe groups are then placed in order so\nthe first things that need to get done\nget done first and so on in a restaurant\ntickets are organized for similar\nreasons so the person preparing the\ningredients knows what to prepare in\ntime for the chef making the specific\ndish and so the whole meal comes\ntogether at the right time in agile\ndevelopment these groups are called\nsprints typically a two-week period\nwhere the various developers work on\ntheir tickets so they're done in time\nfor the next sprint in a restaurant the\nexecutive chef shows the cooking team\neverything that needs to be done for\nthis set of orders the cooks commit to\nwhat dishes they will work on in agile\ndevelopment the same process occurs in\nwhat is called the scrum process\nin agile development teams developers\nlikewise commit for the code they will\ndeliver for the current sprints the\ncooks make the food adjusting the\nseasoning and methods as needed based on\nthe ingredients they have and any issues\nthat come up while cooking to deliver\nthe meal the customer expects as well as\nfrom any feedback from the waitstaff and\ncustomers agile development works the\nsame way developers implement what they\ncommitted to making adjustments as they\ngo to deliver the desired result based\non feedback from stakeholders the\nproduct manager and their own insights a\nrestaurants cooks are always looking to\nmake the food better and the preparation\nprocess better as they cook they discuss\nand record where they need to make\nimprovements with the ingredients or\ncooking process then make adjustments in\ntheir future work agile development\nteams do the same thing giving each\nother feedback during the development\nwork as well as at the end of each\nsprint in what is called a retrospective\nat a restaurant when a batch of orders\nis done the next batch starts up\nfollowing the same process this\ncontinues until service is completed in\nagile development the Sprint's continue\nuntil the product is delivered when that\nhappens the team starts over again on a\nnew product in a restaurant consistency\nis important for every item on the menu\nit's almost an assembly line for food to\naccomplish that the executive chef works\nout the recipes and then teaches them to\nthe cooks and sous chefs typically prep\ncooks also cut up all the vegetables and\nother ingredients in advance to precise\nspecifications so they're ready to use\nwhen the cook needs them in agile\ndevelopment some of the work can be\nautomated such as code management and\nautomated testing likewise\ncontinuous integration ensures all the\ningredients are prepared and then\nassembled properly to form the item\ncontinuous delivery lets you deliver\ncode within each sprint not wait until\nthe end of each sprint that gets the\nsoftware to the business faster though\nin smaller chunks it's like a dim sum or\ntapas restaurant that lets\norder different bites of food throughout\nthe meal delivering each one ready\nrather than delivering the whole meal\nall at once\n",
