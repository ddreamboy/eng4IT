  "text": "I'm going to explain to you how to\nbecome a cyber security engineer but\nit's important to understand that there\nare various Subs specializations that\nfall under the umbrella of being a cyber\nsecurity engineer therefore there are\nvarious Pathways that you can take to\nbecome a cyber security engineer these\nroles are highly paid and organizations\nare always looking for people with the\nskill set of a cyber security engineer\nwhile these roles are highly technical\nby Nature I will give you a stepbystep\nroad map to get you to become a cyber\nsecurity engineer even if you don't have\na degree or any technical knowledge this\nvideo will upset a lot of Gatekeepers\nbecause the word engineer seems to be\nvery triggering some people get really\ndefensive about using the word engineer\nand they insist that you cannot call\nyourself an engineer unless you go to\nuniversity and do an engineering degree\nso in this video I'm going to piss them\noff so bad that I'm going to help you to\nbecome not only a cyber security\nengineer but a worldclass cyber security\nengineer with without needing to do a\ndegree let's get into it first thing is\nyour starting point you could be someone\nwho already Works in it you could be a\nprogrammer or a network engineer or\nperhaps you work in health desk or you\ncould be a seasoned systems engineer who\nworks with Microsoft Windows or even Lin\nor you could be a university student or\nyou could be working in a completely\ndifferent industry like nursing or\naccounting or perhaps you work in a\nwarehouse no matter what your starting\npoint is we first need to understand\nwhat cyber security is before we start\nengineering solutions to solve cyber\nsecurity problems so you may have some\ncyber security knowledge or you may have\nzero cyber security knowledge either way\nthere are non-negotiable cyber security\nprinciples that you must know to\nmaximize your chances of Landing a cyber\nsecurity engineer role these principles\nwill help you both in the interview\nprocess but they will also help ease\nyour transition so the things you learn\nmake a lot more sense there are\ndifferent ways to learn the cyber\nsecurity principles that I'm talking\nabout but my recomend recomended way is\nby either doing the Google cyber\nsecurity search or the Microsoft cyber\nsecurity analyst search because they not\nonly teach you the fundamental\nprinciples of cyber security but they\nalso include Hands-On Labs where you get\nto practice what you learn so things\nmake a lot more sense and you can use\nthat Hands-On practice later on in your\ncareer as a cyber security engineer the\nGoogle cyber security search includes\nLabs that teach you Linux MySQL and\nPython and the Microsoft cyber security\nanalyst search will introduce you to the\nMicrosoft as cloud and the Microsoft\nSentinel platform I have separate videos\nwhere I do a deep dive in each of these\nprograms which I'll leave a link to them\nin the description box below but before\nyou ask the answer is yes if you've done\nthe compa Security Plus or the IBM cyber\nsecurity analyst certification or the\nisc2 CC these are all fine too they will\nintroduce you to the cyber security\nfundamental principles and if you find\nthat you have gaps in your knowledge you\ncan always go back and do the Google\ncyber security search or the Microsoft\ncyber security analyst search now if\nyou're watching this video you probably\nare passionate about a career in cyber\nsecurity or perhaps you have a desire or\na calling deep down that's drawing you\nto cyber security whether to fight cyber\ncrimes or to do something you're\npassionate about that has career\nprogress opportunities but if you choose\nthe pathway of becoming a cyber security\nengineer you need to know that this is\nthe pathway of solving cyber security\nproblems by installing configuring and\ntroubleshooting cyber Security Solutions\nthese Solutions can be a device or a\ngroup of devices or a piece of code or a\nset of tools designed to accomplish the\ntask of stopping Hackers from breaking\ninto an organization or a government\nagency therefore it's crucial to\nunderstand why you're building and\nconfiguring these tools but the Dilemma\nthat we have is that there are so many\ntools out there but not only that a lot\nof those tools are completely different\nthan one another for example there is no\nsimilarities between something like a\nfirewall and a devop scanner that scan\ncode for secure coding principles they\nrequire completely different skill sets\nthe firewall would requ require deep\nnetworking understanding while the\ndevelops toool require understanding of\nprogramming and best practices for\nprogramming when it comes to secure\ncoding now the good news is there is a\nbeginner friendly training course that\nwill quickly introduce you to all of\nthese Concepts at the same time but not\nonly that it also have Hands-On Labs\nwhere you get to practice all of these\nprinciples and tools the course is from\ntryhackme it's called the security\nengineer training it starts by\nintroducing you to the different\nsecurity engineer career Pathways it\nintroduces due to basic principles such\nas cryptography and identity and access\nmanagement then it goes over some of the\nbasic principles of GRC and it will even\nget you to do some vulnerability\nmanagement scanning then on section\nthree it talks about Network and system\nsecurity this is meant to introduce you\nto the principles of being a systems\nengineer or a network security engineer\nand it does a pretty good job at\nintroducing you to Linux Microsoft\nactive directory network security\nprotocols virtualization and it even\nintroduces you to the cloud now section\nfour is my favorite section because it\ntalks about application security so it\ntakes you through the OS top 10 and then\nit talks about API security and the\nsoftware development life cycle it will\nthen introduces you to S and D which we\nwill talk about later in this video the\nlast section of the course talks about\nIncident Management and incident\nresponse that will introduces you to\nwhat a cyber security engineer does when\nit comes to incident detection and\nresponse these are really extremely\nimportant concept that you need to make\nsure that you understand really really\nwell because the last thing I want is\nfor you to become a security engineer\nwho is good with the tools but doesn't\nunderstand why we use the tool and what\npurpose they serve trust me I've made\nthose Engineers they are not good\nEngineers we need to know how to use the\ntool but we also need to understand the\nwhy behind the tools this is what\nseparates the bad engineer from the\nreally good and great Engineers once you\nfinish this training course you will\nhave a pretty good idea about the\ndifferent areas and different tasks that\na cyber security engineer does after\nthat we need to pick a specialization\nand do further training into that\nspecialization to to help us land our\nfirst cyber security engineer role the\nfirst specialization is the detection\nengineer the detection engineer is a\nprofessional who specializes in\ndetecting cyber attacks and malicious\nactivities in the network and this is a\nhuge task because hackers are really\ngood at hiding their tracks there is\nalways new threats there is always new\nattacks so a detection engineer is\nsomeone who's extremely busy and does an\nextremely important job in the industry\nto detect cyber attacks we use a tool\nthat we refer to as seam this is a\ncentralized log server where we get logs\nfrom everywhere in the network and using\nthat seam we create what we refer to as\ndetection use cases so these detection\nuse cases are an automated way for this\nseam to detect unusual activity the\ndetection engineer is the individual who\ncreates those detection use cases they\nrefine those detection use cases and\nthey are always working towards creating\nmore detection use cases and improves\nthe one that are already there now the\nmost prominent seams in the industry are\nSplunk which still has the biggest\nmarket share in the industry but then we\nalso have Microsoft Sentinel which lives\nin the Microsoft Azure Cloud now the\ngood news is Splunk offers completely\nfree training that can take you from\nknowing nothing about Splunk to becoming\nan expert in Splunk I know it's crazy\nbut it's completely free and it's really\ngood quality training so if you want to\nbecome a detection engineer I recommend\nyou do all of the training courses on\nthe Splunk website starting from the\nvery basic ones all the way to the most\nadvanced courses you need to become a\nSplunk wizard because this is the skill\nthat will lead you to becoming a cyber\nsecurity engineer who specializes in\ndetection now getting your first job as\na detection engineer will always be a\nchallenge because you don't have the\nexperience that organizations are asking\nfor I've seen people get their first job\nas detection Engineers using two methods\nthe first one is simply called applying\nto every job that's advertised which I\nhighly recommend that you do once you\nfinish all of these spun courses and\nonce you feel you're confident enough\nwith using spung then you should be\napplying to every job advertised that's\nasking for spun skills the second way\nthat I've seen people get hired as\ndetection engineer is I've seen\nindividuals who work in help desk and\nsome of them work in the networking team\nor in the IT team but then once they\nstart learning spun they start offering\ntheir help to the cyber security team\nthey offer automating some tasks they\noffer helping with detection use cases\nonce you have good Splunk skills there\nare many many ways where you can\ndemonstrate that you have the skills and\nthis way they were able to be hired into\nthe cyber security team to work as\nfull-time detection Engineers I've seen\nit happens there is always a need for\npeople with good Splunk skills now the\nThird Way that I've seen people get\nhired as detection Engineers is they\nsimply start a cyber security analyst\nthere is a fine line between being a\ncyber security analyst that works in\ndetecting and responding to cyber\nattacks and a cyber security engineer\nwho specializes in detecting cyber\nsecurity threats in some environments\nthat individual is the same so you\nperform cyber security analysts tasks\nand cyber security detection engineer\ntasks the team is simply too small so\nyou'll end up doing everything so my\nadvice to you is to be a little bit more\nflexible in your job search just type\nthe word spun and apply to everything\nthis in my opinion is the best way to\nland your first job now if you want to\nlearn Microsoft Sentinel which is an\nimportant theme usually what I want you\nto do is to become good with the\nMicrosoft cloud platform which is\nMicrosoft Azure then you can combine\nthat with Microsoft Sentinel skills I\nwill explain to you how to do that later\nin this video when we talk about the\ncloud security engineer pathway the next\nimportant specialization is the\nautomation engineer the word automation\nis Broad but in every environment we\nalways need someone to automate\nrepetitive tasks now that automation can\nhappen in the health desk or in the\nnetwork or in the cyber security\nOperation Center now I want to prepare\nyou to become an automation engineer in\nthe cyber security Operation Center now\nthere is levels to this game automation\ncan be a simple script or it can be a\ncomplicated program with visual\ndashboards now this is where I will lose\nsome of you but if you want to become an\nautomation engineer you have have to\nlove coding because this is the coding\nspecialty you don't need to learn every\nlanguage Under the Sun in fact we will\npick one programming language and we\nwill get really good at it but we're not\ngoing to do so in a random manner\ninstead I will focus your learning into\nlearning and practicing with cyber\nsecurity tasks relevant to the cyber\nsecurity team so you can land your\nautomation engineer job within the cyber\nsecurity team because those are the ones\nwho will pay you the most trust me on\nthis one now the Google cyber security\nsearch will get you started with python\nwhich is the language that we will use\nfor this specialization but this is\nwhere the real fund begins because we\nwill use it for cyber security purposes\nand that's a specialized use case so to\ndo that the first training that we will\ndo is called python for cyber security\nit's from the infos Institute I'll put a\nlink to it in the description box below\nit will introduce you to how to use\nPython for cyber security tasks it's\nreally good because it will get you\npracticing with extremely important\nConcepts so the first module will be an\nintrodu ction the second module will get\nyou to Deep dive into pretty cool topics\nsuch as persistence execution and\nprivilege escalation if you've ever\nworked as a cyber analyst or if you ever\nlearned any topics related to cyber\nsecurity incident response this course\nwill teach you how to use Python to\naccomplish these tasks extremely useful\ncourse that I recommend for anyone who\nwants to be an automation engineer but I\nalso recommend it to cyber analyst as\nwell because it will make you a better\ncyber security professional now once you\nfinish that the next course that I want\nyou to do is also from the infos\nInstitute it's an advanced python\nscripting for cyber security so it will\ntake everything that you've learned in\nthe first course and it will build on\ntop of it where it will get you to\nperform even more advanced cyber\nsecurity tasks using python now once you\nfinish these two courses you will be\npretty competent with using Python and\nat this stage you can actually start\napplying to jobs as an automation\nengineer or an automation specialist\nThat's focused on cyber security but if\nyou've been watching my videos for a\nwhile you know I'm big on hand on\npractice and practical projects so I've\ncurated a list of practical projects for\nyou that you can use as a portfolio to\nhelp you apply to your first cyber\nsecurity engineer role the first one is\ncalled python scripting for devops it\nwill take you 2 to 3 hours to finish\nthis project it's pretty basic but it\nwill get you to apply your python skills\nwithin a devop environment which is\nsomething you might run into as an\nautomation engineer the next project\nwill also take you about 1 to 3 hours to\nfinish where you will use Python to\ncreate a dis usage report for l this is\na traditional task that we use to\nperform as Unix Engineers so it's a\npretty useful way to get to apply your\npython skills and gain some more Linux\nskills speaking of Unix I have a\ncompletely free weekly cyber security\nnewsletter where I share with you tips\non how to land your first cyber security\njob sometimes they are a followup on the\nvideos and sometimes these are things\nthat I didn't have time to mention in\nthe videos so if you haven't signed up\nyet please head to Unix guy.com and sign\nup today the next project is a little\nbit more advanced and it's cyber\nsecurity focus it will get you to write\nyour own python tool to footprint a web\napplication so it will show you how to\ninstall and use Docker to host your\nprivate web application you will learn\nhow basic web application work you will\nwrite a python script to read from a\ntext file this is a more advanced python\nproject where you will learn a little\nbit more about web hosting about using\nDOA but you'll also perform a pretty\ncool Saba security task the last one is\nalso cyber security related and it's a\nlittle bit harder than the ones that you\nperformed before in this one you will\nlearn a little bit more about encryption\nand how you can use Python to encrypt\ndata now by the end of all of these\nprojects you will be extremely confident\nwith using Python and trust me at this\nstage you will have an extremely\nvaluable skills that employers are\nlooking for so please please start\napplying to jobs because organization\nwill want to hire you now before I move\non just a word for those who think they\nhate coding I've heard this from so many\npeople before they absolutely hate\ncoding in fact on a weekly basis I get\nquestions like do I need to learn coding\nto work in cyber security and as you\nknow the answer is usually no you don't\nneed coding to work in cyber security\nbut if you want to become an automation\nengineer you need coding now some people\ngenuinely don't like coding but in my\nopinion When someone tells me they don't\nlike coding it just tells me that they\nhaven't spent enough time trying to\nlearn coding I could say that I don't\nlike martial arts but the truth is I\nhaven't spend enough time learning\nmartial arts therefore I think I hate\nmartial arts so if you think you hate\ncoding my recommendation to you is just\nstart doing some python scripting start\ndoing some of these courses that I\nrecommended and you'd be surprised maybe\nyou'll end up loving coding and perhaps\nit will be your specialty a cyber\nsecurity professional who knows a\nprogramming language this is like a\nsecret weapon because there is a lot\nthat you can accomplish with a\nprogramming language that is simply not\npossible otherwise the third\nspecialization is the application\nsecurity engineer as the name implies\nthe application security engineer is\nsomeone who specializes in securing\napplications those application can be\nStandalone application they can be\nmobile application or they can be web\napplications the good news is the\ntryhackme security engineer training\ncourse does a pretty good job at\nintroducing you to the vast majority of\ntopics that you will need as an\napplication security engineer so what we\ncan do here is we can further strengthen\nour understanding and knowledge of the\nfundamental important aspects of\nbecoming an application security\nengineer there is only one training\ncourse that I want you to do here which\nis focused on the o top 10 the trackme\ntraining course course does a good job\nat introducing you to these concept but\nI want you to do this one to further\nimprove your understanding and the\nreason why I want you to do it is\nbecause your bread and butter as an\napplication security engineer is the O\ntop 10 you need to be an absolute expert\nin the O top 10 but this will lead me to\nthe biggest dilemma with application\nsecurity you see application Security\nProfessionals disagree on a very\nfundamental issue which is should\napplication security Engineers be\nethical hacker meaning should they be\nable to do penetration testing on web\napplications or is learning the\nfundamentals of application security\nConcepts such as OS top 10 is enough to\nbe a good application security engineer\nto be honest with you the answer is a\nlittle bit more nuanced because I think\nboth sides have Merit to their arguments\nso what should you do let me clarify to\nunderstand this you need to understand\nthe difference between s and d s is\nbasically the static analysis of an\napplication this is where application\ndevelopers have written the code maybe\nsome of it maybe all of it and you can\ncome and analyze this code that can\nhappen through running a secure code\nscanner or you can read that code and\ninterpret it to make sure that they\nfollowed the OS top 10 recommendations\nfor example during this phase you don't\nreally need to do any penetration\ntesting because just the secure code\nreview is enough but when you do D which\nis dynamic analysis of applications\nthat's when we need to perform ethical\nhacking now from what I've seen in the\nindustry people who do application\nsecurity they're not the same people\npeople who do the penetration test in\nthe real world we usually have an\nexternal organization they come and they\nperform the penetration test because we\nneed an independent entity to tell us\nthe problem within the code so as an\napplication security professional you're\nkind of the first level of Defense\nbecause you catch these problems you get\nthem fixed before the application is\nfinished this way when the ethical\nhackers come and test the application\nthere is very little to find now my\nverdict if you want to become a really\ngood application security engineer or\nfirst off you need to follow the\nrecommendation that I've outlined before\nso do the tryck me security engineer\ntraining then do the OS top 10 training\nthat's your basic fundamentals I believe\nthe next step for you is to learn a\nprogramming language because it's really\nhard to analyze code and find problems\nwith codes if you don't know how to code\nyourself so a good suggestion for you as\nan application security engineer is to\ndo the python recommendations that I've\noutlined in the previous section because\nthat knowledge will make you a really\ngood application security engineer now\nas far as learning penetration testing\nfor application security engineer I\nthink it's not necessary I think it's a\nlittle bit of an Overkill but if you've\ndone all of the recommendations that\nI've outlined before and you've even\nlearned python I think the next step for\nyou is to practice those a top 10\nrecommendation in a lab environment and\nthe good news is there is a completely\nfree training and free Hands-On lab from\nPort swinger this is extremely useful\nbecause they have individual labs for\neach and every topic in the O top 10\nwhere you will get to practice and see\nhow these vulnerabilities look like and\nhow you can fix them I can't recommend\nthese courses enough for you if you want\nto be a really good application security\nengineer and trust me some of the\nbiggest organizations in the industry\nlike Google and meta are always looking\nfor good application security Engineers\nso if this is your jam you will do\nreally really well the next one is the\nsystems and network security Engineers\nto be completely honest with you I\nalmost didn't include this one in this\nvideo but I've kept it here just for the\nsake of completion but also because I\nknow some of you are interested in this\npathway this is the individual who\nconfigures the firewall the proxy the WB\nalso this is the individual who perhaps\nconfigure Microsoft active directory or\nthey do some kind of system security\ntasks such as hardening Windows Os or\nhardening Linux OS now the problem with\nthis specialization and the reason why I\ndidn't want to include it here is\nbecause the truth is this doesn't really\nfall under cyber security the title have\nthe word Security in it and the cyber\nsecurity team need these task to be\nperformed but usually the individual who\nperformed this task is someone who's\nfirst and foremost a really good network\nengineer or a really good system\nengineer so if you want to be the\nnetwork security engineer who configures\nthe firewall or the proxy or the W you\nactually need to be a network engineer\nwho then learns these tools in terms of\ntraining if you're a network engineer\nthen Cisco has a set of free training\nthat's focused on cyber security that\nyou can do and likewise Palo Alto have\nalso a set of tree training that's\nfocused on their own own products and\ntheir own firewalls but other than that\njust know that these titles while they\nhave the word Security in them they're\nreally Network Engineers that perform an\nextremely important task for the\norganization now the next specialization\nis the cloud security engineer the cloud\nsecurity engineer is someone who is\nreally good with the cloud they are a\ncloud engineer first and foremost but\nthen they also have cyber security\nskills and they know how to implement\ncyber security recommendations within\nthe cloud environment I've said this\nbefore and I will say again but\ncombining Cloud skills with cyber\nsecurity skills is potentially the best\nthing that you can do to your career\nbecause there is a huge demand for\npeople with Cloud skills and cyber\nsecurity skills the main Cloud platform\nthat you need to learn are the Amazon\nAWS Cloud the Microsoft Azure cloud and\nto a lesser extent the Google cloud and\none thing to know about all of these\nplatforms is that they're extremely\nsimilar so if you get good with one of\nthese platforms then it's really easy to\nswitch to other platforms they work\nexactly the same just the naming\nconvention is different now if you want\nto become a cloud security engineer\nthere is a cloud security Focus\ncertification from each of these vendors\nso from AWS there is the AWS security\nspecialty from Microsoft Azure there is\nthe Microsoft Azure Cloud engineer\nassociate and there is even a Google\nCloud security engineer certification if\nyou want to know how to get started and\nhow to learn and pass these\ncertification and how to eventually\nbecome a cloud security engineer then I\ncreated a stepbystep road map focused on\njust the cloud security engineer pathway\nin this video where I will show you the\nfastest and cheapest way to becoming a\ncloud security engineer and I'll see you\nthere\n",
