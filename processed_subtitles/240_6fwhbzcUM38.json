  "text": "hello and welcome back to my channel\nyou know as artificial intelligence\nbecomes a bigger part of our everyday\nlives we really need to think about the\nethical side of things AI has the\npotential to do some amazing stuff like\nmaking Health Care better or improving\nschools but without the right ethical\nguidance AI could also cause some\nproblems we didn't expect like making\nbiased decisions or invading our privacy\nso in today's video I want to give you a\nrundown of AI ethics why it's important\nand the main ideas behind developing\nethical AI\nAI ethics the need for ethical\nconsiderations\nwhen it comes to AI there are quite a\nfew ethical challenges we need to think\nabout because they can have a big impact\non society one of the main concerns is\nthat AI systems might make existing\nbiases even worse leading to unfair\ntreatment and discrimination for example\nfacial recognition technology hasn't\nbeen great at recognizing people with\ndarker skin tones which raises concerns\nabout racial bias\nanother big ethical issue we need to\nthink about is how AI affects our\nprivacy you see AI systems need a lot of\npersonal data to work well and that can\npotentially mess with our privacy rights\nplus AI is used more and more in making\ndecisions and that's got people worried\nabout transparency and accountability\nAI algorithms can be kind of like black\nboxes where it's hard to figure out how\nthey're making their decisions\nthis lack of transparency can make it\ntough to trust AI systems and might lead\nto unfair or just plain wrong results\nbecause of these ethical challenges it's\nsuper important to make AI systems that\nfollow ethical principles and focus on\nfairness transparency and accountability\nto tackle these concerns a bunch of\norganizations and researchers have come\nup with ethical guidelines and ideas for\ndeveloping AI main principles guiding\nethical AI development\nfairness making sure AI systems don't\ntreat some people or groups unfairly is\na really important ethical idea to make\nAI Fair developers need to think about\npossible biases in their algorithms and\ndo something about them this might mean\nusing all kinds of different data for\ntraining checking AI systems for bias\nnow and then and using machine learning\ntechniques that are built to be fair\ntransparency AI systems need to be clear\nabout how they're making decisions so\nthat we can trust them and hold them\naccountable\nthis idea of transparent AI sometimes\ncalled explainable AI is all about\nmaking AI algorithms easy for us regular\nfolks to understand creating transparent\nAI systems might involve using models\nthat are easier to interpret or\nexplaining AI decisions after the fact\nprivacy keeping our privacy safe is\nanother big ethical idea when it comes\nto AI\nAI developers have to think about\nprivacy when they're designing and using\nAI systems and they should use\ntechniques that help protect our privacy\nlike differential privacy and Federated\nlearning these methods let AI systems\nlearn from data without actually getting\ntheir hands on our sensitive personal\ninfo accountability\nAI systems and the people who make them\nneed to be held responsible for what\nthey do that means we need ways to keep\nan eye on check up on and judge AI\nsystems and we need to know who's\nresponsible for AI related decisions\nplus it's super important to have a\nculture where AI developers feel a sense\nof ethical responsibility so we can be\nsure AI systems follow ethical\nprinciples\nconclusion\nso folks as AI becomes more and more a\npart of our Lives we really need to keep\na close eye on the ethical side of\nthings yes AI has the power to do some\nincredible things like making our health\ncare better or giving our schools a\nboost at the same time if we don't pay\nattention AI could also cause some\nunintended problems like creating biased\ndecisions or stepping on our privacy\nthat's why I wanted to share some\nthoughts of AI ethics the reasons it\nmatters and the main ideas that help\nguide the development of ethical AI\nand there you have it thank you for\nwatching and if you have not already\nplease like And subscribe have a great\nday\n",
