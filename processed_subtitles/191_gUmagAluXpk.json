  "text": "all you need to learn machine learning\nin 2024 is a laptop and a list of the\nsteps you need to take I'm a student\nresearcher working for an ex meta\nprofessor and have had interviews with\nGoogle Deep Mind Amazon and other cool\ncompanies but it took me over 3 years to\nget to this point so today I will share\nhow I would learn machine learning if I\ncould start over by revealing the six\nkey steps you need to take let's get\ngoing in general all these steps don't\nhave to be strictly completed in any\nparticular order but I would not start\nwith the final and arguably most\nimportant step that said what I do\nhighly recommend is to start with\nlearning the basics of python python is\nthe programming language used by pretty\nmuch everyone to work on machine\nlearning and every other step on this\nlist Builds on top of it this mainly\napplies to beginners that don't know\nwhat a list or a dictionary are and that\ndon't know how to write a simple if else\nstatement or a for loop I would even go\nas far as saying you need to learn what\na list comprehension and what class\ninheritance are and honestly I don't\nknow what else to say than just type in\nPython tutorial or course on YouTube or\nGoogle and get started there's so much\namazing free content out there but you\nshould always keep in Minds to actively\ncode along the tutorial enjoy getting\ninto machine learning with python but\ndon't go too in depth this lets you\nstart with a fun experience because at\nsome point you will also have to learn\nmaths now you could argue that you don't\nneed mouths because so much is already\nautomated and taken care of by cool\npython libraries which is true but you\nwill need to know all the fundamentals\nof calculus linear algebra and\nprobability Theory to understand pretty\nmuch any machine learning approach that\nsaid you really don't need complex maths\nmost of the maths is high school or\nentrylevel college maths like you just\nneed to understand what the derivative\nof a function is and how to compute it\nyou need to know what a matrix is and\nhow the dot product works there again\nare amazing resources out there that are\nfree like these courses right here or a\nwebsite called Can Academy I mean you\ncan even learn most of what you need on\nbrilliant.org sadly not sponsored or you\njust go to college and take the\nmandatory maths classes for any\nengineering major I'll tell you about my\nabsolute favorite resource for learning\nthe fundamental Maths for new networks\nafter we cover the next important steps\nthis already shows you that you don't\nneed to hustle through all the m courses\nthere are in the beginning in fact I\nwouldn't even recommend that because it\ncan be very frustrating and just not fun\nwhenever you don't understand some maths\nlater on you can always revisit it by\njust Googling learn the basics and then\ncontinue on to the next fun step\nlearning about the ml developer stack so\nnow you know the basics of python and if\nyou haven't already can learn some basic\ntools like Jupiter notebooks and\nlibraries like pandas numpy and matplot\nlip numpy is a library for for doing\nmouths with matrices or arrays it's a\ngreat starting point because you can now\nimplement the mouths that you just\nlearned about and see how simple it is\nto compute a DOT product between two\nmatrices met plot lip is a tool for\nvisualizing data and graphs and just\nseeing what maths you are doing and in\nmy opinion at least visualizing stuff is\nfun and just very useful finally pandas\nis a great tool for dealing with data\nthat is in tabular format a lot of\nmachine learning problems deal with\ntabular data and pandas lets you again\nvery easily manipulate those and\nvisualize the tables all those libraries\nalso work very well with Jupiter\nnotebooks and are an essential part of\nlearning machine learning as you will\nsee by getting to know those Frameworks\nyou will automatically improve your\noverall practical Python and ml skills\nbut again only focus on the basics by\nfollowing a few tutorials later when\nworking on projects you'll really get to\nknow the libraries so now let's get back\nto some Theory and finally actually\nlearn about machine learning and deep\nlearning okay up until now everything\nshould honestly not take too long\nperhaps a few weeks depending on how\nmuch time you put in and at what level\nyou already are but the ml courses I\nwill now recommend do take some time the\nbest and probably most famous machine\nlearning course or collection of courses\nis the machine learning specialization\nby Andrew Nung the cool thing is that\nyou here already get to know some\nmachine learning Frameworks like psyched\nlearn and tensorflow well I do have to\nadmit I personally prefer and would\nrecommend py Toge but learning one\nframework pretty much lets you already\nquickly adapt to the other one this\ncourse is absolute gold and it's free\nalthough this is the beginner course it\nis still very important they here teach\na lot of classical ml Concepts and those\nare the things you need to be able to\nanswer quite easily in ml interviews now\nremember when I teased my favorite\nresource for learning maths in neural\nnetworks well after learning about those\nin Andrew's course I would watch Andre\nkathi's neural network series he here\nimplements a simple NLP model from the\nground up and goes all the way up to a\nTransformer model he also goes through\nall the maths of back propagation and so\non I cannot recommend this series enough\nsince in Andrew NS and Andre kathi's\ncourses you already get some practical\nexperience with the taught ml Concepts I\nwould then continue on to the next more\nadvanced and practical course the Deep\nlearning specialization this course\nfocuses more on implementing and\ntraining new Nets and the absolutely\namazing thing here is that they also\ninclude hugging face which is a library\nthat you pretty much cannot avoid it's\nreally amazing and if you feel like this\ncourse doesn't teach you enough about\nhugging face you can also just go\nthrough the hugging face NLP course\ndirectly there you also learn even more\nadvanced concepts in NLP well if you are\ninterested in NLP that is so yeah those\nare the two or perhaps even three\ncourses I would take and recommend by\nnow you have learned a lot and worked on\nseveral smaller projects or rather\ntutorials now it's time to actually get\nyour hands dirty and work on real\nprojects I honestly think you here learn\nthe most and there are two things I\nwould work on first I would go to kagle\nand just work on challenges there are\nmany available for any level try not to\nunderestimate the complexity and start\nwith simpler challenges so you don't get\nfrustrated and demotivated and if you do\ntake on more difficult ones that also\ncome with prize money don't expect to\nwin one it's really difficult to get to\nthat point and you also need a lot of\ncompute so okay after working on kegle\nchallenges comes my final and favorite\ntype of project to work on\nreimplementing a paper and recreating\nthe results this is challenging and you\nwill learn a lot and most importantly\nthis type of project will definitely\nhelp you stand out on your ml\napplication that said there are a few\nother simpler ways to stand out that you\ncan already get started during your\nlearning process so I'm sure you might\nwant to watch this video right here\nwhere I reveal those techniques and tips\nbye-bye\n",
