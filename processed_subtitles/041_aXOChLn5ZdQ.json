  "text": "JavaScript an embarrassing toy language\nused exclusively to build things it's\nnot supposed to it was created by\nBrendan Ike in 1995 who was given\nrequirements to build a language like\nJava but for words it only took him\nseven days to execute flawlessly it\nbecame an overnight dumpster fire but\n really hit the fan in 2005 when\nRyan Dahl made the Epic mistake of\nbringing JavaScript to the server with\nnode.js just like Alfred Nobel and\ndynamite he would go on to apologize for\nhis invention many years later and it's\nmy fault and I'm very sorry the language\nis designed for only one use case to\nannoy people with browser pop-ups but\ntoday it's used to build memory hogging\ndesktop apps with electron janky mobile\napps with react native and unreliable\napis with express.js no matter what\nyou're trying to build there are\nhundreds of different game-changing\nnext-gen libraries to get the job done\nthat's because whenever a JavaScript\ndeveloper encounters a problem it will\ninstinctively create a brand new\nframework and upload it to GitHub with a\nbunch of emojis in the readme in fact\nthere are so many npm packages that Al\nGore is now predicting the Arctic will\nbe ice free by 2013 you have stolen my\ndreams in my childhood unlike languages\npeople actually like JavaScript doesn't\nhave a mascot but they are working with\nDavid Cronenberg to design one it's a\nLoosely typed language and by that I\nmean completely detached from reality\nwhen you add an array to an object\nobviously it returns a string that says\nobject object now switch the order of\nthe operands and predictably it returns\nzero if you want a good laugh for\nyourself try adding two objects together\nyou'll get object object object object\nnow with that knowledge what do you\nthink two arrays will equal obviously an\nempty string that makes total sense\nbecause the number zero is equivalent to\nan empty array and also equivalent to a\nstring of zero and that means the only\npossible same conclusion is that a\nstring of zero is also equivalent to an\nempty array but amazingly it's not\neverybody knows you never go full retire\nit got this way because Netscape did a\nfocus group in the 90s with some\nhomeless web developers they found on\nthe street who thought two plus two\nshould equal 22 and of course that's why\n2 minus two equals zero when a language\nis this bad and this popular at the same\ntime it creates an ecosystem where\nlibraries like is odd which does exactly\nwhat the name implies can get over 400\ndown or no 400 000 downloads per week\nthe fun thing about packages is that\nthere's multiple module systems like\ncommon JS and esm so you never know if\nthe package you're installing is\nactually going to work now if you do\nmanage to build something with\nJavaScript it'll probably never see the\nlight of day because then you have to\nlearn module bundling with a tool like\nwebpack and it's just not worth it man\nthis has been my cathartic release from\nover 10 years of JavaScript development\ndespite its problems it's evolved into\nan awesome language in 2022 and I love\nprogramming with it today is\nThanksgiving and I'm extremely thankful\nfor JavaScript because it puts food on\nmy family if you want to master the\nbasics all this reverse psychology\nshould motivate you to buy my JavaScript\ncourse and if you don't buy it I won't\nmake any money thanks for watching and I\nwill see you in the next one assuming\nI'm not entirely canceled after this\nvideo\n",
