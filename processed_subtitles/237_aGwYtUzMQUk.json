  "text": "I want to start off with talking to you about \nthree things that keep me up at night, right? \n \nThree things: the first, and it may be, you \nknow, very common for you too, is climate change.  \nClimate change absolutely keeps me up at night. The second thing that keeps me up at night  \nis that people may have no idea that an artificial intelligence is making a decision that directly  \nimpacts their lives - what percentage interest \nrate you get on your loan, whether you get that  \njob that you applied for, whether your kid gets \ninto that college that they really want to go to. \nToday AI is making decisions \nthat directly impact you.\nThe third thing that keeps me up at night \nis: even when people know that an AI  \nis making a decision about them, they may assume \nthat because it's not a fallible human with bias,  \nthat somehow the AI is going to make a decision that's morally or ethically squeaky clean,  \nand that could not be farther from the truth. \n \nSo, if you think about organizations \nand what happens over 80% of the time  \nproof of concepts associated with artificial \nintelligence actually gets stalled in testing  \nand more often than not it is because people do not trust the results from that AI model.\nSo, we're going to talk a lot about trust,  \nand when thinking about trust (I’m going to \nswitch colors here) there's actually five pillars.\nOK, when you're thinking about what does it \ntake to earn trust in an artificial intelligence  \nthat's being made by your organization or being procured by your organization: five pillars. \n \nThe first thing to be thinking about \nis fairness. How can you ensure  \nthat the AI model is fair towards everybody in particular historically underrepresented groups. \n \nOK, the second is explainable is your AI model explainable such that you'd be able to tell  \nsomebody, an end user, what data sets were being \nused in order to curate that model, what methods,  \nwhat expertise was the data lineage in provenance \nassociated with, how that model was trained. \n \nThe third: robustness. Can you assure end users \nthat nobody can hack such an AI model such that  \na person could disadvantage \nwillfully other people and or  \nmake the results of that model benefit \none particular person over another?\n \nThe fourth is transparency. Are you telling \npeople, right off the bat, that the AI model  \nis indeed being used to make \nthat decision and are you giving  \npeople access to a fact sheet or metadata so \nthat they can learn more about that model? \n\t\n \nAnd the fifth one is: are you \nassuring people's data privacy? \nSo, those are the five pillars. OK, now \nIBM has come up with three principles  \nwhen thinking about AI in an organization. The first being that the purpose of artificial  \nintelligence is really meant to be to augment \nhuman intelligence not to replace it.\n \nThe second is that data and the insights from \nthose data belong to the creator alone\n\t\n \nOK, and the third is that AI systems, and I would \nopine the entire AI life cycle, really should be  \ntransparent and explainable, right? \n \nSo, so, those are the five pillars.  \nNow, the next thing I want you to remember as \nyou're thinking about this space of earning  \ntrust and artificial intelligence is that this is \nnot a technological challenge. It can't be solved  \nwith just throwing tools and tech over some kind \nof fence. This is a socio-technological challenge.  \n\"Social\" meaning people, people, people. \nSocio-technological challenges because  \nit's a socio-technological challenge it \nmust be addressed holistically, okay? \n \n\"Holistically\" meaning there's three major things \nthat you should think about. I mentioned people,  \npeople the culture of your organization, right? \nThinking about the diversity of your teams,  \nyou know, your data science team. Who is curating \nthat data to train that model? How many women are  \non that team? How many minorities are on that \nteam, right? Think about diversity. I don't  \nknow if you've ever heard of the the \"wisdom of \ncrowds\". That's actually a proven mathematical  \ntheory: the more diverse your group of people, \nthe less chance for error, and that is absolutely  \ntrue in the realm of artificial intelligence. \n \nThe second thing is process or governance, right? \nWhat is it that use your organization \nwhat are you going to promise your  \nboth your employees as well as the market with \nrespect to what standards you're going to stand by  \nfor your AI model in terms of things like fairness \nand explainability accountability, etc., right?\n \nAnd the third area is tooling, right? What are \nthe tools, AI engineering methods, frameworks  \nthat you can use in order to ensure these \nthings, ensure those five pillars, and we're  \ngonna do a deep dive into that as well, but the \nnext show that I’m going to be running with you  \nwe're actually going to be talking about this \none. About people and culture. So, stay tuned. \n \nIf you like this video and series, please \ncomment below stay tuned for more videos  \nthat are part of this series and to \nget updates please like and subscribe.\n",
