  "text": "feature selection in machine learning my\nname is Richard kersner with the\nsimplylearn team that's www.s simply\nlearn.com get certified get ahead today\nwe're going to look at what's in it for\nyou the need for feature selection what\nis feature selection feature selection\nmethods feature selection statistics\nso the need for feature selection to\ntrain a model we collect huge quantities\nof data to help the machine learn better\nconsider a table which contains\ninformation on old cars the model\ndecides which cars must be crushed for\nspare parts and when we talk about huge\nquantities of data they they save\neverything from people's favorite cat\npictures to and you can imagine there's\nso much data out there even in a company\nthey'll save all these little pieces of\ninformation about people and companies\nand corporations you need some way to\nsort through because if you try to run\nyour models on all of it you'll end up\nwith these very clunky models and they\nmight have uh issues which we'll talk\nabout later but in this case we're\ntalking about cars and crushing but not\nall this data will be useful to us some\nclasses or part of the data may not\ncontribute much to our model and could\nbe dropped and you can see right here we\nhave uh who was the owner of the car um\nin our data a car will not be crushed\nbased on its previous owner um so you\nknow that's kind of a clear cut you can\nsee see that why would I care who owned\nthe car before once it's in the junkyard\nand we're crushing the cars we're not\ngoing to really care about that so here\nwe have dropped the owner column as it\ndoes not contribute to the model having\ntoo much unnecessary data can cause the\nmodel to be slow the model may also\nlearn from this irrevelant data and be\ninaccurate so feature selection is a\nprocess of reducing the input variable\nto your model by using only relevant\ndata and getting rid of the noise in the\ndata consider the database given below a\nlibrary wants to donate some old books\nto make place in their shelves for new\nbooks we want to train a model to\nautomate this task in this case the\ncolor of the book does not matter and\nkeeping it can cause a model to learn to\ndonate books based on color we can\nremove this as a feature using feature\nselection we can optimize our model in\nseveral ways and so the number one is to\nprevent learning from noise and\noverfitting uh that's actually the huge\none because we we don't want it to give\nus the wrong prediction and that means\nalso improved accuracy uh so instead of\ngiving us a wrong prediction we also\nwant it to be as close to the right\nanswer as we can get and we want to\nreduce the training time it's an\nexponential growth in some of these\nmodels so that each feature you add in\nincreases that much more training time\nwe talk about feature selection methods\nuh we put together a ni little flowchart\nthat shows the various methods used for\nfeature\nselection and you have your basic\nfeature selection and then there is\nsupervised and\nunsupervised under supervised there's\nintrinsic wrapper method filter method\nso we talk about unsupervised feature\nselection refers to the method which\ndoes not need the output label class for\nfeature selection and that was uh you\ncan see here under super unsupervised we\ndon't havean that's really a growing\nmarket right now um supervised learning\nand so feature selection is the same\nthing supervised feature selection\nrefers to the method which uses the\noutput label class for the feature\nselection and if you remember we looked\nat uh three different we have intrinsic\nwrapper and filter method so we're going\nto start with the filter method on this\nnow remember we know what the output is\nso we're going to be looking at that\noutput to see how well it's doing versus\nthe features in this method features are\ndropped based on their relation to the\noutput how they are correlating to the\noutput and you can see here we have a\nset of features selecting best feature\nlearning algorithm and then performance\nand so we want to find out which feature\ncorrelates to the performance on the\noutput consider the example of book\nclassifier here we dro the color column\nbased on simple deduction and that kind\nof sums it up in the in a nutshell is we\nwant to filter out things that clearly\ndo not go with what we're looking for we\nlook at the wrapper method uh in the\nwrapper method we split our data into\nsubsets and train a model using this\nbased on the output of the model we add\nand subtract features and train the\nmodel again and you can see here in the\nwrapper method where we have a set of\nfeatures uh we generate a subset we run\nit through the algorithm and we see how\neach one of those subset of features\nperforms consider the book data set by\nusing the wrapper method we would use a\nsubset of different features to train\nthe machine and adjust a subset\naccording to the output and so you can\nsee here let's say we take uh name and\nnumber of times red and we run just\nthose and we look at the output and if\nwe looked at them with all four inputs\nand look at the output we'd see quite a\ndifferent variation in there and we\nmight say you know what condition of the\nbook and color really doesn't uh affect\nwhat we're looking for and you can see\nhere we've rented on uh condition of the\nbook and\ncolor depending on the output of the\nmodel we will choose our final set of\nfeatures these features will give us the\nbest result for our model\nand I might come up that the name number\nof times red is probably pretty\nimportant the intrinsic method uh this\nmethod combines the qualities of both\nfilter and wrapper method to create the\nbest subset the model will train and\ncheck the accuracy of different subsets\nand select the best among them we kind\nof looked at a little overview of some\nof the stuff um some of the common\nfeature selection algorithms based on\nwhich method they belong to are given\nbelow and you'll see it's primarily\nunder supervised there's not like I said\na lot of unsupervised methods and the\nones that are usually used these methods\nand finds a way to create a supervised\num connection between the data when we\ntalk about supervised uh methods we have\nour filter method which we talked about\nuh and it uses like the Pearson's\ncoefficient uh CH squared a Nova\ncoefficient those are all under the\nfilter method and in the wrapper method\nrecursive feature elimination so\nremember we're choosing a subset and we\nwant to go through there and look at\neach on so you're just doing a lot of\nLoops or recursive um calculations to\nsee which one works best and which ones\ndon't have an impact on the output and\nthere's a lot of genetic algorithms to\ngo with us too on the wrapper method and\nhow they evaluate it and with the\nintrinsic method uh there's the two main\nones we're looking at is the lasso\nregularization the lasso algorithms are\nbasically your standard um regression\nmodel so it's finding out how these\ndifferent methods fit together and which\nones have the best um add together to\nhave the least amount of error the other\none used in the intrinsic method is a\ndecision tree it says hey if this one is\nuh this one produces this result this\none produces this result yes no which\nway do we go based on the input and the\noutput variables we can choose our\nfeature selection model so you have your\nnumeric input coming in you have your\nnumeric output if you use the Pearson's\ncorrelation coefficient or spearman's\nrank coefficient uh you can then select\ncect what features you're going to feed\ninto that specific model and you maybe\nhave a numerical input and a categorical\ninput so we're going to be looking more\nat a Nova correlation coefficient or\nKindle's rank coefficient and if you had\na core categorical input and a numerical\noutput we might be looking at a Nova\ncorrelation coefficient in Kindle's rank\ncoefficient So based on the input and\nthe output variables we can choose our\nfeature selection model and you can see\nwe have categorical to categorical we\nmight be looking at the the um chai\nsquared test um contingency tables and\nmutual information let's go a and take a\nlook and see uh in the python code what\nwe're talking about here and I'm going\nto go ahead and use for my IDE the\nJupiter notebook in the and I always\nlaunch it out of anaconda here and we'll\ngo ahead and go up here and create a new\nPython 3\nmodule and we'll call it\nuh\nfeature select\nand since we're in Python we're going to\nbe working mainly with your numpy your\npandas your map plot Library so we have\nour number array our data frame setup\nwhich goes with the number array the\nnumpy the Panda's data frame and then we\nwant to go ahead and graph everything so\nwe're going to import these three\nmodules and then we put down other some\nuh data um we're going to read this in\nit's uh Kobe Bryant I guess he's a b\nbasketball player our guys in the back\nuh we have a number of them guys it's\nboth we have a lot of men and women so\nit's probably a misnomer our team in the\nback um they have a some of them have a\nliking for basketball and they know who\nKobe Bryant is and they want to learn a\nlittle bit more about Kobe Bryant and\nwhat's going in for what whatever is\ngoing on with his game in basketball so\nwe're going to take a look at him uh and\nonce we import the data we can see what\ncolumns are available uh original\nfeatures count so we can see how many\nfeatures are um the length of it and\nwe'll actually have a list of them and\nthen print just a uh the data head the\ntop five\nrows and so when we do this we can see\nfrom this CSV file uh we have 25\noriginal features our original features\nare your action type combined shot type\ngame event ID and so forth there's a lot\nof features in here that they're\nrecorded on all of his shots this is\nwhat we talk about like a massive amount\nof data I mean people are sitting there\nand they they record all this stuff and\nthey import this stuff for different\nreasons but depending on what we want to\nlook at do we really want all those\nfeatures maybe the question we're going\nto ask is uh what's the chance of him\nmaking any one specific\nshot um in right from the beginning we\ncan look at the some of these things and\nsay team name uh team name probably I\ndon't know maybe it does matter because\nthe other team might be really good at\ndefense uh game date maybe we don't\nreally want to look look at the game\ndate team ID definitely not of\nimportance in any of this uh so when we\nlook at this we have 25 features and\nsome of these features just really don't\nmatter to us we also have location X\nlocation y latitude and longitude I'm\nguessing that's the same data we've\nactually imported the the very similar\ndata maybe they're slightly zoned\ndifferently but as far as our program we\ndon't want to repeat data some of the\nmodels when you repeat data into them\nand this is true for post models create\na huge bias they weigh that data over\nother data so just at a glance these are\nthe things we're looking at we want to\nfind out well how do we get this these\nfeatures down and get rid of this bias\nand all these um extraneous features\nthat we don't really want to spend time\nrunning our models on and programming\non and as I pointed out there's a\nlocation x a location y latitude and\nlongitude\nuh let's just take a look at that and\nsee what we're looking at here uh we'll\ngo ahead and create a plot of these and\nwe'll just plot uh we'll do a scatter\nplot of location X and location Y and\nthen we'll do a um a scatter plot of um\ndata lawn data lat which is probably\nlongitude and latitude and the scatter\nplot just going actually put a little\nTitle Here location and Scatter on there\nwe'll just go ahead and plot these and\nwhen you look at\nthis uh coming in\nin these two graphs are pretty identical\nexcept they're flipped and so when we\nlook at the location from which they're\nshooting from they're probably the same\nand at this point we can say okay we can\nget rid of one of these sets of datas we\ndon't need both X and Y and latitude and\nlongitude because it's the same data\ncoming in and as we look at this\nparticular data the latitude longitude\nuh we might also ask does it really make\na difference which side of the Court\nyou're on uh whether you're on the left\nside or the right side and so we might\ngo ahead and explore um instead of\nlooking at this\nas XY we might look at it as a distance\nand an angle and we can easily compute\nthat and you can see we can create our\ndata distance equals location X um plus\na location y^2 standard uh ukian\ngeometry or triangular\ngeometry hypotenuse squared equals the\neach side\nsquared and then once we've done\nthat uh we can also compute the angle uh\nso the data angle is based on the arc\ntangent uh and so forth on here so this\nis all this is is we're just going to\ncompute the angle here and then set that\nup uh pi over two to get our\nangle and we'll go ahead and run\nthat and you'll see some errors Run come\nup and that's because when we took\nslices over here we took a slice of a\nslice um there's ways to fix that but\nit's really not important for this\nexample uh so if you do see that you\nwant to start looking up here for um\ninstead of data location X of uh not\nlocation x0 this would be like um I\nbelieve the term is I do iocation uh if\nthis was yeah this is in pandas uh so\nthere's different things in there but\nfor this it doesn't really matter uh\nthese are just warnings that's all they\nare and then let's combine our remaining\nminutes and seconds column into one uh\nthere's another one so if you remember\nup here we're trying to get rid of these\ncolumns do we really need let me see if\nI can find it on here there we go\nthere's our minutes\nremaining um and then they had what was\nit it was uh minutes remaining and\nseconds column so there's also a seconds\ncolumn on here uh let me see if I can\nfind that one this is where it really\ngets kind of crazy because here's our\nseconds remaining so you can see that\nand here's our minutes remaining this\ngets crazy when you're looking at\nhundreds of these features uh and you\ncan see that if if I'm going to say um\nwrite a model that's going to predict a\nlot of this and I want it to run in this\ncase it's a basketball and how good his\nshots are as the data comes in let's say\nI want to have it run on your phone if\nI'm running it across hundreds of\nfeatures it's going to just hang up on\nyour phone where if I can get it down to\njust a handful um we'll actually be able\nto come in here and run it on a smaller\ndevice and not use up as much memory or\nprocessing power uh so we'll go ahead\nand take data remaining time\nhere um and data minutes remaining times\n60 plus data seconds remaining so we're\njust going to combine those and we'll go\nahead and reprint our data so we can see\nwhat we\ngot um coming across we have our action\ntype combined and this is we do this a\nlot uh we want to take a look at o I got\nit so so zoomed in let me see if I can\nzoom out just a little bit there we go\nboom all right so we come up here you\ncan see that we now have our distance\nour angle remaining time which is now\njust a number uh that computes both the\nminutes and seconds\ntogether and we still have we we've been\nadding columns I thought you said we're\nsupposed to subtract columns right um\nwe're going to delete the obsolete\ncolumns when we get to them uh so we're\njust filtering out and this is a filter\nmethod we're just filtering through the\nthings uh that we really don't need and\nnext let's go ahead and explore team ID\nand team name let me just go ahead and\nrun that and if you look at this uh we\nhave Los Angeles Lakers and then they\nhave the team ID here and they're unique\nuh there's not that's not really\nanything that's going to come up uh\nbecause that's this particular\nathletes works for that team so it's the\nsame on every line so there's another\nthing we can filter out on there team ID\nand te name is just useless uh the whole\ncolumn contains only one value each and\nit's pretty much useless let's go ahead\nand take a look at matchup and opponent\nthat's an interesting one and we see\nhere that uh we have the L versus p and\nthe opponent is p and I\nIND again here's a lot of duplicate\ninformation uh so this basically\ncontains the same information on here\nagain we're filtering all this stuff out\nand this is because we're only looking\nat one athlete this might change if\nyou're looking at multiple athletes that\nkind of thing now these are easy to see\nwe might have something that looks more\nlike this um we might have something\nwhere we're looking at the distance\nwhich we computed and the shot distance\nare they the same thing and what we can\ndo is we can plot that and plot them\nagainst each other on here and we see it\njust draws a nice straight line uh and\nso again we're looking at the same\ninformation so again we're repeating\nstuff and we really don't want to be\nrunning our model on uh repeat\ninformation on here so again it contains\nthe same information so now let's look\nat the shot Zone area shot Zone basic\nshot Zone\nrange so now we're looking at the zones\nand what does that mean and we'll go\nahead and and do this also in a scatter\nplot um in this case we're going to just\ncreate three of these side by side so\nwe're going to create um our plot figure\nside 20 by10\nand then we're going to Define our\nscatter plot by category feature and\nwe're going to do each one uh set up on\nhere give it it slightly different color\nand so our shot Zone area is going to be\nplot uh subplot 131 scatter 131 is how\nthat's read by the way uh meaning that\nit's number\none um we have three\nacross and this is the first one down so\none one one our scatter plot by category\nis going to be the shot Zone area we're\ngoing to plot that and then we're going\nto do the shot Zone basic and then the\nshot Zone range and each just push them\nthrough our definition so each of those\nareas go through and you'll see 13 1 132\n133 again it's a 1x3 um setup and then\nit's just a place on each one and so\nwhen we look at this we can see that\nthese shots uh they map out the same so\nit's very again redundant information\nthat should be intuitive um when looking\nat this in these color\ngraphs it kind of helps and you start\nlooking at something you it's very\nintuitive like this is and you start to\nrealize that some of this stuff um\nyou'll be looking for in data you might\nnot understand and you'll see these\ncircular patterns where they match or\nthey mostly match and you start to\nrealize um when you're looking at these\nthat they're repetitive data and then\nyou want to explore them more closely\ndepending on what domain you're working\nin so we we look at these and we look at\nthem and they look just like the regions\nof the Court uh but we already have\nstored this information in angle and\ndistance columns so we've seen this\nimage before we go back up here and\nhere's our the similar\nimage and repeating that image is down\nhere and so let's go ahead and drop some\nof this in this stuff uh so now let's\ndrop all the useless columns and we can\ndrop the shot ID team ID team name shot\nZone area shot Zone range shot Zone\nbasic uh the matchup\nuh the longitude and latitude we're\nputting that into distance seconds\nremaining minutes remaining because we\ncombine that into one column shot\ndistance because we have just distance\non there location X location y the game\nevent ID game ID all this stuff is just\nbeing dropped on here and we'll just go\nahead and loop through our drops and\nthis is a nice way of doing this because\nas you're playing with this um this kind\nof data putting your list into one setup\nhelps uh because then you're just\nrunning it through an\niteration and you can come back and\nchange it uh you might be playing with\ndifferent models and do this with models\nyou might be looking at all kinds of\ndifferent things that you can drop and\nadd in as you test these out and again\nwe're working in the filter method so\nthis is a lot of human interaction with\nthe data and it takes a lot of critical\nthinking to look at this stuff and say\nwhat matches and what doesn't and so\nwhen we look at the remaining features\nuh let me go ahe and just run this\nuh the original to the new count we had\n25 features now we have 11 features you\ncan see that right there we just circle\nthat there's our 25 and there's uh old\nnew now we're down to 11 so we've cut it\ndown to less than half uh and you can\njust see the actual different\ninformation on here and the remaining\ntime at this point we filtered it\nthrough and then we'd move into the next\nprocess which would be to run our model\non this and maybe we would draw\num some of the features and see if it\nruns better or worse and what\nhappens uh that's kind of would be the\nnext step on there versus is the filter\nsetup and that would be one of the other\nsetups depending on which algorithm you\nuse so that wraps up our demo on uh\nfilter the feature selection and going\nthrough and seeing how these different\nfeatures are being repeated in this\nparticular in a basketball uh setup\nthere's like I said there's a lot of\nother me methods on there but the filter\none is really good because that's where\nyou usually start you want to have your\nown Visual and try to understand how it\nworks thank you for joining us for\nsimplylearn that's www.s
