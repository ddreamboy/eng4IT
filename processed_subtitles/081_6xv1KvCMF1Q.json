  "text": "what's going on everybody welcome back\nto another video today we are starting\nour tableau tutorial series\n[Music]\nnow this series is for absolute\nbeginners so if you have never used\ntableau before you are in the perfect\nplace i'm going to take you all the way\nfrom the very beginning of installing it\nand just understanding what tableau is\nand how you can use it all the way to\ncreating dashboards and sharing it now\npersonally i hate those videos that are\nlike three hours long and they just\nexpect you to go through it i like to\nbreak my videos up into chunks so if you\nhave ever done my sequel tutorials\nyou'll know that i like to break things\nup so it gives you time to try them out\nand do them yourself and then you can\nmove on to the next video so i'm gonna\nbe breaking this up into five separate\nvideos but in this video i'm going to\nshow you how to install tableau for free\ni'm going to show you the user interface\nwe're going to download a data set that\nyou can find on kaggle and then we will\nbuild our first visualization together\nwith that being said let's jump over my\nscreen and we'll get started all right\nso the very first thing that we need to\ndo is you need to actually download\ntableau so we're not going to be using\ntableau we're going to be using a free\nversion called tablet public it has a\nlot of the same features except of\ncourse it's not\nevery single feature that regular\ntableau has but it is absolutely perfect\nfor learning it and for using it and and\nyou can even build um you know\ndashboards and share those for your\nportfolio\num i'm going to put this link in the\ndescription so you can just go and click\non that and all you have to do is input\nyour email right here and click download\nthe app um and then it should start to\ndownload and then you can save that and\nthen you're gonna open this up now\ni'm gonna open it up i don't know what\nit's going to do i already have it\ndownloaded um but it should open up and\nlook hopefully like what you're seeing\non\nmy screen in just a second\nlet's see what it does\num i hope you can see this but it says\ntableau public\nit says i already have it set up but\nyou're gonna click install and go\nthrough all that um all that setup stuff\nuh so i'm gonna exit out of here\ni'm gonna go over here and type in\ntableau public\nand it's 20 21.3 that's the current\nversion that they have out if you're\ndoing this in the future they may have\nyou know different versions\nso you should be able to pull this up\nright here now\ni'm going to\ngo and get our data set that we're going\nto be using and i'm going to show you\nhow to get that as well and then we will\nactually jump into tableau and start\nusing it\nso let's go over here i'm going to get a\ndata set from kaggle i wanted something\npretty generic\nto show you in future videos i'm going\nto show you some special or not special\nbut just different visualizations that\nyou might use\nand we'll get different data sets for\nthose because of course not one data set\ncovers all these other types of\nvisualizations so\nwe're starting off pretty simple right\nhere we're going to be getting one\ncalled video game sales\nand\nwe can take a really quick look at it um\nhere are some of the fields that you're\ngoing to be having\nlike rank name platform the year genre\nand then some sales data\nand this is what it actually looks like\nit's called vg sales so video game sales\nand then csv\nand um you know here are the fields\nand we have our data and all we are\ngoing to do is we're going to download\nthat\nand i will save it now when you download\nit it's going to be saved into a zip\nfile so we need to go to our downloads\nuh let's refresh this\nhere's our archive we need to go in here\nyou can just copy it\nand paste it right back into here\num and just so you know that is a\na csv so be aware of that\nso what we want to do is you want to\ncome in here now since it is a csv this\nis not we're not going to be using\nmicrosoft excel we're going to be using\nthe text file so we'll come in here\nwe'll take vg sales now i uh one thing i\nwant to do before i do that is i'm going\nto rename mine\nuh vgs\nsales underscore one\ni've already\nprepared for this and so i already have\nthat in there but so i want to make a\ndistinct one for myself you do not have\nto do that so we'll come back here\num and then we're going to do text file\nand vg sales\nwe're going to open that up\nand\nwhen it pulls up right here\nyou can bring in other tables and then\nyou can start to join them together and\ncreate those relationships we are not\ngoing to be doing that in this video\nwe'll do that in a separate one\nas for you know just getting started you\nknow we're not going to be using that\nbut you can see\nsome of these\nthings\nor some of these fields\nand if you notice they\nthey um\nthey're either abc or they're a number\nso it starts to categorize\nwhat this field type is so is it a\nstring is it numeric it starts to\nautomatically do that and that's all\ndone within tableau\nand so it just kind of reads it and\nthat's what it does\nwhat we're going to do is when i click\nright down here it's called go to\nworksheet\nthe worksheets are where you're going to\nactually start being able to build your\nvisualizations your charts your graphs\nall these things\nand so you know we have this in here now\nand so we're just going to click right\nhere\non go to worksheet as you can see here\nis vg sales underscore one\nyou will not have the underscore one if\nyou did not add that like i did\nbut right down here you can see all the\nfields that we just imported from that\ndata set and they even created one right\nhere for us they just generated that\nfield\nbased on the file so it's a count of all\nthe rows really\nso what i'm going to do is i'm just\ngoing to walk you through\nbasically what we're looking at some of\nthe things that we're going to be using\ntoday there will be things that i don't\ntalk about but i'm going to highlight\nthose instead in in future videos when\nwe start using those or going over them\num and so let's just start with the most\nobvious one it's way over here i'm sure\nyou saw it when we uh this first came up\non the screen because it has all these\ndifferent charts and visualizations and\ngraphs and\nthese will become available as you start\ndragging and dropping our data into this\nsheet\nand so if i go right here it says four\nscatter plots try zero or more\ndimensions two to four measures so what\nour dimensions are are right here and\nwhat our measures are are right down\nhere\nand so typically uh things like like you\nsay genre or names or strings like that\nare going to be\nthese dimensions and then a lot of a lot\nof times the numerical is going to be\nare going to be measures\nnext what i want to show you is right\nhere so you can take something like\nglobal sales and you can drag it right\nhere into your rows\nand then it\ntakes your rows and so it automatically\ncreated a sum of global sales now if we\ntake that away let's say we drag it\nright here it's going to give us a\ncolumn\nnow you can also do it right up here you\ndon't have to\ndrag it on screen\nyou can also\njust add it to the column or the row\nthat's typically what i do i it's just\nmore intuitive to me\nor you can drop it in this section right\nhere and it does its best to assign it\nsome type of\nsome type of visualization and so that's\nwhat it always is trying to do it is\ntrying to say okay this is what you're\ntrying to do let me try to\nget the best visualization for the data\nthat you're giving me\nnow while we are here\nit went down here into marks and marks\nis a very important area\nit's where you can add color size text\ndetail and tool tip and i'm not going to\ngo into what all those are because i'm\njust going to show you\nso let's start pulling some fields in\nhere and creating a visualization and\nthen i'm going to show you how all of\nthat works including filters as well so\nthe first thing that we're going to look\nat is global sales and let's put that in\nthe rows\nand then i'm going to take year and i'm\ngoing to make that the column\nand this is basically exactly what\ni wanted to do now as of right now\nit has only the year and it's looking at\nglobal sales for everything but we want\nto break that out a little bit better\ni want to break it out by let's do genre\nso different genre of games now\nif i add that right here to these\ncolumns it is going to break it up by\nyear\nand genre\nif i add it right here\nis going to break it out by the year of\ncourse but then in each individual row\nhas the different genre that's not what\nwe want we want to keep\nthis type of line graph\nand what we're going to do is we're\ngoing to add it to marks\nand you can't really see it based off of\nthese colors but they're all different\nso we have action genre we have the\nsports genre racing role playing all\nthese different genres within it now we\ncan get rid of that because we don't\nneed it anymore\nand this is where\nthese\nthese marks really come in handy because\nyou can start\nbasically doing what you want with them\nso for the genre i want to be able to\nsee all these different genres with\ndifferent colors to me that just makes\nthe most sense so i'm going to put color\nright here\nand automatically it assigns every\nsingle genre its own color and gives us\nthis legend right over here\nand so it's really easy to\nsee well when you have smaller numbers\nis much easier but i know that red is\nsports and i can go right here and find\nred and that is sports\nso it makes it a lot easier than when it\nis all the same color blue\nso what you can do after that is you can\nalso add things like a label to it so if\nwe take label and we or we take genre\nput label\nyou can click right here and you can get\nrid of the labels that you have and you\ncan see them right down here or you can\nalso change\nthe font so if you want to make it\norange or whatever color you can do all\nthe same things\nand you can also do things like changing\nwhere you see these things\nso for action you're going to see it a\nton because for each year action is is\nat the\nis on the higher end and so you're\nseeing those in those mins and maxes\nyou can also do it for a selected area\nso if i come in here and i select it\nit's then going to show me what those\nare so label is really really uh useful\nreally helpful\nlet me get rid of that really quick\nuh you can also do it where the lines\nend so line ends is at the beginning and\nthe end and you can also take that away\nor put that back on so labels are really\nimportant labels aren't very helpful\nwhen you're doing at least i don't find\nthat it's super helpful when you're\ndoing things like genre so when you're\ndoing your dimensions so i'm going to\nget rid of that and i'm actually going\nto bring\nour global sales over here\nand let's label that\nand right now i think it's labeling the\nline ends we want to do the min and max\nnow if we do min and max on the table\nit's just gonna give us the max and the\nmin which is zero and then 139.4\nit's a little bit more useful if we do\nit\nper each line uh this at least gives us\nsome context i probably wouldn't do this\nin an actual visual visualization but to\ngive you some understanding of how just\nhow it works so now i know that um right\nover here the min and the max or the min\nsorry the max for these for action\nand for sports is right around 138 139\nso it's pretty easy to see\nand you can\nagain go in here and you can remove the\nmax or remove the mins whichever one you\nfeel is best\nyou'll probably keep the maximums in\nthere for each category and so this is a\nreally quickly becoming a pretty usable\nvisualization and it's not the only\nlabel that you can add we still are\nusing year over here so we can always\ndrop year and there as well we'll create\na label and so now we have let's see for\nthis one is a puzzle genre\nso we also have the year that it had the\nmaximum\nsales and so you know just some things\nthat you can do you don't have to add\nthat\nnow let's go up here and we're going to\ntake a look at filters because filters\nare really important you know if you are\nmaking this for a client or you're\nmaking this for somebody you want them\nto be able to filter down\nto very specific information that they\nwant to see so let's take uh the\nplatform lots of different platforms\num as you can see you know ps4 xbox\nif you're familiar with these we'll\nclick all of these\nand we'll click ok\nso now this is an option as a filter and\nall we're going to do is we're going to\nclick on this arrow right here and we're\ngoing to say show filter\nnow right now all of them are selected\nso every single one is being taken into\naccount for this visualization\nbut let's say we come down here and we\nsay okay i don't want to see sales for\nany of these ps the original playstation\ntwo three or four so i'm gonna get rid\nof this one this one\nthis one\nand this one and you could immediately\nsee the the changes that were happening\nso now none of the numbers none of those\nsales are being accounted for and and\nbeing added to the sum of global sales\nright here at all\nso\nthat is just how a filter\ncan work and\nyou can also\ndo that\nand you can get rid of all of them and\nyou can go in and actually just pick\nvery specific sales so if you only want\nto see the playstation sales you can go\nin there and do that as well so really\nreally handy filters are things that you\nat least want to have as an option for\nmost of your your visualizations at\nleast that's what i found especially\nwhen you're doing client-facing work\nthey like to\nget in there and mess around and look at\ndifferent look at it in different ways\nand so that's one that i i think is is\nreally useful to to have\nthe very last thing that we want to do\nis we want to actually add this to a\ndashboard now\nlet's say we come right down here and we\nadd a new worksheet\nand actually we might change one more\nthing on that last one but we'll just\nmake a really simple one\nwe'll just give it genre and we'll give\nit global sales as the rose\nand this nifty button right up here\nwhich is a sorting button so i'm going\nto sort like that\ni'm going to add the genre in just as we\ndid i'll give it different colors\nperfect\nnow we have two really quick different\nvisualizations right\nwhat i want to do is just show you how\nto combine those because what you are\ngoing to do\nis you're going to actually come in here\nand you're going to do new dashboard\nthat's what this button is right here\nnow when we come in here the size is\nextremely small it's very easy to fix\nthat all we're going to do is click\nright here\nwe're going to go to this range or this\ndrop down and we're going to click\nautomatic\nso now it is a much larger size for us\nto actually drop our visualizations into\nuh and let's put sheet one\nand we'll put let's put it up top\nso now it looks a little bit like this\nnot perfect but again\nif i wanted to make this look a lot\nbetter i definitely would\nand then you can go over here and you\ncan rename these things you can also do\nthat back when we were in our actual uh\nworksheets but you can also do it here\nas well and then start um you know\ncustomizing and building it out that's\nnot what this video is for that is the\nlast video we're going to build an\nentire dashboard it'll be kind of like a\nsmall project you can put that in your\nportfolio\nif you have gotten this far and you want\nto jump straight into it and you don't\nwant to wait for these other videos to\ncome out or you don't you just want to\njump straight into creating an entire\nportfolio project i have an entire\nportfolio project series that covers sql\npython and tableau and so go check out\nthat series i have one video dedicated\nto tableau it's like 45 minutes or an\nhour long\nand it covers a lot of the things that\nwe're going to hear in here as well as a\nfew other things\nbut i appreciate you checking out this\nvideo in future videos we'll be going\nover things like creating bins\ncalculated fields doing joins and then\ncreating a final project and putting it\nall together so thank you so much for\njoining me i really appreciate it if you\nlike this video be sure to like and\nsubscribe below and i will see you in\nthe next video\n[Music]\n",
