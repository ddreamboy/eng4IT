  "text": "this is Yang Lee and he got his PhD from\nthe Chinese uh Academy of Science in\n2002 and uh he did his post at Berkeley\nuh with James land and uh now he's at\nthe University of Washington and he's\ngoing to talk a bit about uh some work\nhe's done most recently on something\ncalled the activity designer um and his\nhis his area and interest have been in\nsay rapid prototyping tools for\nubiquitous Computing\napplications uh this talk is going to be\nexternal and go up on YouTube so if\nyou've got uh questions that are of a\nconfidential nature then we need to hold\nthem to the end when the camera is no\nlonger roll so without further Ado\nthanks Rich um let's just waiting for\nslides to show up\nso sorry for beating okay hopefully it's\na everything will\nbe what's going on\nokay thanks everyone um so I'm going to\ntalk about my work on rapid prototype\ntools for ubiquitous Computing\napplications first I would like to give\nyou a sense of what ubicom applications\nI focused on uh so ubicom applications\nare those that can support our everyday\nactivities in the physical world one\nuh nice example here is a Google Maps or\niPhone I think a lot of you know what it\nwhat it is so the the application can\napproximate the user's current location\nusing widely accessible cell tower\ninformation based on the sense location\nof the user it can then provide useful\nservices such as uh finding nearby\nbusinesses another example here is the\nIntel scet display it gives caregivers a\ncontinuous awareness about the elders\neveryday activities that are detected we\nrid uh sensing\nTechnologies so for for uh for example\nuh when the when the Elder forgets to\ntake her medication uh the icon on the\ndisplay that depicts the medication\nstatus will turn rate so the caregiver\nknows what happened so with advances in\nsensor Technologies as well uh as a\nComputing\ninfrastructures there is a huge\npotential to build applications like\nthese examples to simplify our lives and\nto achieve the vision of UB\nComputing so however it's very difficult\nto design ubicom\napplications compared to the\nwell-defined desktop Computing\nenvironments we are all familiar with\nreal world environments are more complex\nright and our everyday activities in the\nphysical world are more Dynamic and less\nstructured another problem here is uh uh\nyou become often involves sophisticated\nTechnologies so it require higher levels\nof technical expertise to prototype and\ntest you become\napplications so before I go on talking\nabout how I am going to address these\nproblems let's first reflect on the\nsuccess we have uh with a desktop\ncomputer applications and the graphical\nuser interfaces so a common practice in\nuser interface design is uh the\niterativity the alternative design that\ninvolves uh rapidly creating prototypes\nand testing prototypes with users to get\nfeedback so many tools have been\ndeveloped uh for the process one of the\nearliest successful examples is uh\nApple's hyper card hyper card allows\npeople who don't have much uh technical\nbackground uh to easily create graphical\nuser\ninterfaces another example is dyam so\nit's a tool for the early stage design\nof websites I was heavily involved uh in\nthe development of uh\nDynam so it has been downloaded over\n100,000 times since 2001 so it's really\npopular to for the early stage for the\nearly stage design of\nwebsites so rapid prototyping tools like\nthese examples have played\na important role in the success of\ndesktop com Computing and the graphical\nuser interfaces so the purpose of these\ntools is not for creating full-fledged\nfinal applications but rather they can\nlower the bar for interaction designers\nuh to create interactive prototypes and\ntest these prototypes with end users to\nget\nfeedback\nso this uh turns out to be the key\nfactor\nfor producing useful and usable user\ninterfaces so to to achieve similar\nsuccess for uus computing I would like\nto\nuh provide computational tool support\nfor designers to easily design test the\nubicom applications for the rest of my\ntalk uh first I'm going to briefly talk\nabout my early work with topiary for\nrapidly prototyping location enhanced\napplications a specific form of ubom\napplications and then I'm going to spend\nmost time talking about my recent work\non activity based prototype as well as\nuh it's to support activity\ndesigner so when first started uh\nlooking at the domain of ubicom design\nit's such a broad space that is\ndifficult to be uh addressed by a single\npiece of\nwork so I focused on location enhanced\napplications uh these applications can\nprovide useful services using the\nlocation of people places and things\nright so I already talked about what\nGoogle uh iPhone map does at the\nbeginning of the talk uh alcohol is\nanother application it keeps track of\nphysical objects patients and doctors in\nHospital building so these applications\nare useful but they are difficult to\ndesign and\ntest so location enhanced applications\noften require a high level of technical\nexpertise to design for example location\nand the place uh sensor Technologies are\nnonstandard and and\ncomplex although some tour kits are\navailable for programmers it often takes\nweeks or even months to build a location\nenhanced application before it can be\ntested with end users to get any\nfeedback so it's too slow and expensive\nto iterate on designs right\nso for people who don't know how to\nprogram such as interaction designers\nthere are no tools available at all to\naddress these problems I created top a\ntool for non-technical designers to uh\neasily create and the test location\nenhanced\napplications so there are two major\nresearch goals I intend to achieve uh\nwith a top so one how we can allow\ndesigners to easily design location\nbased behaviors without programming\nright another goal here is how can we\nallow a design to be tested with users\nin the field without having to deploy a\nlocation infrastructure so location\ninfrastructures are not always available\nespecially indors right and there are\nalso some complicated issues such as\nlocation to place uh inference\nokay so here I would like to use a\nrunning example to talk about how\ntopiary address the design of location\nenhanced applications let's assume we\nwant to design a a location based tour\nguide so these are the list of features\nwe want to\nhave to design session application the\nfirst thing we want to do is to describe\nlocation context of Interest as in or\nout of place near or far from somewhere\nor\nsomebody\nso to allow designers to easily specify\nlocation uh location context I created a\nvisual language in top for this purpose\nso you can first import a map image unit\ntwo as background optionally we can draw\na root Network on top of the map right\nso the road network will be used for\nconstructing shortest path\nat the wrun\ntime then we can add models of people\nplaces and things right so the map\nnaturally represent the special\nrelationship uh between these entities\nfor example Bob is in the bookstore in\naddition to presence context such as in\nor out we can also specify proximity\ncontext such as near or far for example\nalthough Carol is outside of the parking\nlot her proximity region intersects the\nboundary of the parking lot which\nindicates Caro is near the parking lot\nwhile she is far from all other entities\nso we can move people and uh things on\nthe map to represent diverse spatial\nrelationships then we can drop a\nrecording window uh to capture location\ncontext of Interest right so the\nrecording window works like a screen\ncapture to but instead of capturing\npixels on uh on the screen Tober\ncaptures special relationships of those\nentities that are included by the\nrecording window so in this case we got\nBob is in the bookstore right\nso then we can uh generalize it captur\nthe location scenario for example\nreplacing the book the concrete Place\nbookstore with a any\nplace so of course we we can also\ncapture uh Reacher locations in scenario\nsuch as Carol MB in the par lot it can\nbe represented by multiple spatial\nrelationships here so the V language\nhere does not necessarily cover the the\nentire space of location context but it\ncan cover a useful subset of location\ncontext which are useful for uh rapid\nprototyping\npurpose so then actually we can use the\ncapture location context\nto specify location based behaviors uh\nusing a storyboard so a page represent a\nscreen of video output and the link repr\nuh represents a transition between Pages\nfor\nexample when the user clicks on the get\ninfo button uh the Prototype will show\nuh the bookstore page when the Bob when\nBob is in the bookstore and show the\nlibrary page when Bob is in the library\nright and uh when Bob is in neither of\nthese two places the Prototype shows the\nmap another link here starts from the\npage itself the link the transition can\nautomatically take place as long as the\nassociated scenario is true in this case\nwhen anyone moves near Bob the Prototype\nshows a table of friends so that's how\nthe behavior of the Prototype depends on\nthe location of the user right so once\nwe have a prototype we want to test the\nPrototype with users uh how can we do\nthat so\ntraditionally a prototype of a\ndesktop application is tested with uh\nparticipants in a lab right but the\ntarget use scenario of location enhanced\napplications are often in the field and\nwhen the user is mobile and a prototype\nshould behave based on the changing\nlocation of the user so the controlled\nlab environment is no longer appropriate\nas a result topiary uses uh so-called\nwizard of a approach to test a location\nprototype so in such a test a user walks\nin the field with a mobile device uh for\nrunning the\nPrototype then the designer acts like\nwizard simulates the user's location or\na separate\ndevice now I'm going to play a a video\nclip to give you a sense how this works\nso the designer can start a prototype on\na mobile device such as a\nPDA then the device can be handed to the\nend user uh the designer can follow the\nthe user around in the field and then\nsimulates the users location on the map\non separate device so the change of the\nuser application will trigger the\napplication behavior and a user can\ninteract with the Prototype on the uh\nmobile\ndevice so topar has been downloaded uh\nover a thousand times since 2004 and\nit's Inus by researchers and the\nUniversity students\num so I'm not going to talk about\ndetails here I if you you're interested\nI know we can talk afterwards so here I\nwould like to give you a summary about\nwhy we want to do alternative design\nwith a top right so without\ntop we can only explore uh so it took us\na few weeks to just explore a single\ndesign and we had to program and deal\nwith sensors but with tobery uh we can\nexplore multiple designs just in a few\nhours right and uh all the time during\nthe design process we only need to deal\nwith a high level abstractions such as\nMaps story boards and wither\nR okay so after I developed the top in\nnatural start was uh how we can provide\ncom computational tool support for\npeople to easily uh prototype and test a\nbroader set of ubom\napplications to achieve that goal uh\nthere are two Central research questions\nright so one is uh how we can go Beyond\nlocation right so top uses a map\nmetaphor to represent location context\nso one would be an appropriate framework\nor structure to incorporate more diverse\ncontextual information information into\nthe design another question here is how\nwe can go beyond controlled environments\nfor testing you become applications\nright for many ubom applications it's\nvery important to to test them in\npeople's everyday\nlives so top design can can be tested in\nthe field but it's it's a still a\ncontroled environment right so the\nwizard has to follow the user around so\non one hand we want these prototypes to\nbe created at a low cost on the other\nhand we want them to be tested in\npeople's everyday lives over a extended\nperiod of time which inevitably uh\nrequire High degrees of realism and\nrobustness with these research questions\nin mind I focused on a set of emerging\nyou become applications so these\napplications employ Rich contextual\ninformation about people's everyday\nlives and they show high value by by\nsupporting PE uh people's long-term\nactivities uh such as uh uh keeping feed\nand\nuh elder\ncare but again these applications are\nvery difficult to design test it's more\ndifficult to design test than location\nbased\napplications so to understand why it's\ndifficult to design and test the these\napplications here I would like to uh\nlook into the design and development\nprocess of ubit the application\ndeveloped at uh Intel Research Seattle\nuh UB improves people's awareness about\ntheir physical activities by visualizing\ntheir uh workout status uh as flowers or\nbutterfly for\nexample the more exercises a user has\ndone the more flowers will be shown on\nthe display right so first ubifit is\naddressing a very complex Target domain\nit supports keeping feed long-term\nactivity could spend years or even the\nlifetime of the\nuser uh second ubed requires high levels\nof technical expertise to prototype it\ntook a crew of technically skilled\nresearchers two years to design develop\nand deploy\nubifit and finally\nfinally uh because ubit is addressing a\nlong-term activity it has to be tested\nin people's everyday lives uh over an\nextended period of time so that the\nimpact of the design can be observed\nright it would be impossible to observe\nthe behavior change in a short period of\ntime\nso it turned out uh um these\ndifficulties are not just with the\nparticular project of you\nfit my colleagues and I conducted the\ninterviews with uh 11 professional\ninteraction designers and we find many\ndesigners encountered similar challenges\nand we found field research is very\nimportant uh for uom design and uh it's\nimportant to bring field findings into a\ndesign process as a context for design\nand currently there's no tool support\nfor that and uh because of high level\ntechnical barrier\nuh exist for experimenting with new\nideas it's very difficult and expensive\nto push a early idea to functional\nprototype and to the real world\nexperiment so these are the problems are\nI intend to\naddress so my research goal at the high\nlevel uh is to Pro is to provide\ncomputational tool support to allow\nnon-technical people people to easily\nprototype and deploy what used to take a\nteam of researchers weeks and months to\ndo\nso to achieve that goal I created uh a\nactivity designer a rapid low threshold\nprototype uh to for uh ubicom\napplications\nso here I would like to use a real\nexample to talk about why activity\ndesigner is useful in design ubicom\napplications UB GRE is a project\nconducted by researchers at University\nof Washington carage M University and\nthe uh Intel Research Seattle so ubig\ngreen addresses Environmental Protection\nby encouraging people uh to do\nTransportation activities that have less\nimpact on the environment\nright so the designer started design um\nby describing what are possible\nTransportation activities right so the\nthe information can come from field\nresearch or solely based on the\nknowledge of the designer then the\ndesigner uh create a prototype uh called\nthe UB or phone application using\ngraphical story body and the prototyping\nby demonstration as we can see here the\ndesigner used a lot of examples to\ndescribe how the leaves of the tree\nshould change based on the number of\ngreen activities a user has\ndone okay so then the designer deployed\nthe prototype to multiple part part uh\nparticipants and it only took a few uh\nbutton clicks and copy paste to deploy\nsuch a prototype so it's really a lot\neasier uh for\ndeployment the Prototype was tested with\na multiple partic participants over two\nweeks and uh\nparticipants Transportation activities\nwere detected in a combined way uh some\nbasic Transportation activities such as\nrunning or biking are detected by mobile\nsensing platforms which are developed at\nIntel Research Seattle and UD\nup some Transportation activities which\nare difficult to be detected such as\ndriving and taking bus uh these\nactivities are reported by users uh\nthemselves so during the testing process\nthe designer was able to monitor\nmultiple tests at the same time on a\nremote computer so as we can see here\nthe designer had two kinds of designs\nand each of them was tested with a six\nparticipants so it's like a a between\nsubject study the the so the designer\nintended to find out which design is uh\nbetter\nuh and the designer\ncan uh revise the design and redeploy\nthe design any time remotely so the\ndesigner didn't have to collect all the\nmobile devices back in order to deploy a\nnew design he he could he could just do\nit\nremotely okay okay so uh hopefully at\nthis point you got a rough idea about\nwhat activity designer does so now I I\nwould like to flash out more details\nabout the two and the uh theory behind\nthe two so the process I I intended to\nsupport with activity designer is a\nso-called uh activity based prototyping\nso the process uh starts with a field\nresearch then it goes through the loop\nof activity analysis and\nmodeling uh interaction prototyping and\nintive\ntesting at the first glance the process\nuh seems like a simple extension of the\nalterative process interative design\nprocess but what's special here is uh\nthe important role uh human activities\nare playing so human activities are used\nas a first class objects in the entire\ndesign\nprocess activities are transformed from\nfield observations to activity models to\ncomputational\nconstructs so back to the question\nhow how can we incorporate diverse\ncontextual information into a design\nright so how can we incorporate context\nreach human activities into the design\nprocess uh that's a to answer that\nquestion I looked into\nto uh activity Theory now I'm going to\ntalk a little bit about Theory\nuh before we get to the technical uh\ndetails so activity\nTheory uh offers a consistent view about\ncontext and it also gives uh activity\nhierarchy the hierarchy\nincludes activities actions and uh\noperations for example for the long-term\nactivity keeping feed it can be carried\nout as a set of actions such as lifting\nwavs and running or\ntreadmill an action can in turn be\ndecomposed uh as a sequence of\noperations such as pushing the quick\nbutton to start and running so the\nhierarchy captures the essence of a\nlong-term activity but it's inadequate\nto capture the situation\nfactors that might be associated with uh\nactivities such as location information\nwe cannot fit the location information\ninto the\nhierarchy\nso for ubicom design I I introduced a\nfew new Concepts uh to the hierarchy for\nexample for the for the running action\nit can happen in multiple situations\nright Running With Friends at the gym or\nrunning alone at the park so I call the\ncombination of an action and a situation\nis seene so a seene is a\ndirect uh observation about people's\neveryday lives and then the same action\ncan serve for multiple purposes or for\nserve for multiple themes that's a high\nlevel activity\nstructures for example running for\nkeeping feed and running for fun so a\ntheme is a equivalent concept of\nactivities in activity Theory\nso the hierarchy actually uh the uh\nframework here underlines the entire\nactivity designer system as I'm going to\nshow in the next few\nslides so now I'm going to talk about\nthe key features of activity designer in\nsupporting each of these\nsteps so field data may come in uh as a\nfree text imagees uh\nuh images video clips or metadata such\nas uh structured questionnaires so this\nuh this field data can be imported in\nthe two as a collection of scenes or\nobservations so you don't have to do a\nfield research uh to use a to you can\njust add these uh observations based on\nyour own knowledge right then based on\nthis uh individual observations then we\ncan can create high level activity\nstructures themes a theme is a a aspect\nabout people's everyday lives for\nexample eating healthy and having fun\nare two aspects for staying healthy\nright so each theme is associated with a\nsubset of scenes or\nobservations clicking on theme will make\nactivity designer only uh to show a\nsubset of\nobservations so on this\nactivity uh models uh observations and\nthemes are maintained visible throughout\na uh design process that's how they can\nform a context for design so designers\ncan picture target activities in their\nmind as I'm going to show in the next\nfew slides these activity models are\nalso an important resource for creating\nfunctional prototypes and they are also\na basis for generating computation\nconstructs for running these prototypes\nat a run\ntime okay so then the next step is to\ncreate uh to create functional\nprototypes in activity designer we can\ncreate multiple prot multiple prototypes\nat the same time so we can think uh\nglobally in terms of how each of these\nprototypes should behave to to provide\ncoordinated support for Target activ\nactivities the storyboard here shows the\ndesign of the uh house monitor\napplication uh so I'm going to use this\ndesign to talk about uh the key features\nof activity\ndesigner okay let's do something\nconcrete here the first uh feature we\nwant to prototype here is uh uh turns\nthe purple fish to a gold fish when the\nuser hands run uh when the user has\nachieved her weekly exercise goal which\nis uh running in the gym four times a\nweek so the key part to prototype this\nfeature is to specify the condition\nright when the user has join in the gym\nfour times this\nweek to design such a feature the\ndesigner can drag the running workout\naction to the link to create a condition\na default query is a con uh\nconstructed then the designer can\ninteractively customize the query into a\nTarget form such as specifying time\nperiods confidence value activities of\nInterest\nyep so the activity query language\nallows designers to easily specify\nactivity queries over noisy event\nstreams so we can specify activity\noccurrences of of Interest using a list\nof filters the specification here\nrepresents all the running workout of\nthe user or a friend in the gym or\npark we can also use a theme to\nrepresent a class of actions of\nsituation uh situational factors the\nsecond specification here uh represents\nall the actions of the user for having\nfun so in addition to graphical\nstoryboarding for prototyping we can\nalso demonstrate how the interface\noutput uh should change based on the\nusers's activities for example based on\nthe three example at the bottom of the\nscreen the system can learn the mapping\nbetween the numerical value of the\nnutrition status and the video output so\nthe so the dial will rotate at the right\ntime based on the uh nutrition\nstatus for those uh Advanced designers\nor users they can also script uh uh Rich\nbehaviors so I'm not going to talk about\nthis in detail\nhere so then we can test a design any\ntime with uh simulated activity data\nright so in the in the activity uh\ndesigner uh uh we can also debug the\ndesign like uh we can click on we can\ninteract with the Prototype like uh any\nuser can so we can test multiple\nprototypes at the same\n[Music]\ntime\nyeah okay then we can test the these\nprototypes with the real users on the\ntarget\ndevices so activity designer provides\ntwo options for running a prototype uh a\nprototype can directly uh run on the\nactivity designer virtual machine if the\ntarget device is a high-end device such\nas a tablet P uh PC um for the lowend\ndevices such as a mobile phone the\nvirtual machine will not be able to run\nso in that case a prototype can be\nautomatically converted to a web\napplication it's actually based on uh\nGoogle web toolkit so it's really cool\nuh so at the one time users activities\ncan be detected uh via real sensors are\nreported by uh users themselves I\nmentioned this earlier so all these\ncomponents are communicating with each\nother through activity server a key a\nkey component in the activ activy\ndesigner runtime architecture so the\narchitecture allows a new component to\nbe easily plugged in for example if we\nhave a new sensing technology we can\nplug it in and it will\nwork so these uh uh interfaces for\nreporting activities and these Computing\nconstructs such as sensor wrappers or\ndatabase structures they are all\nautomatically generated based on\nactivity models we created at the very\nbeginning of the design so it really\nmakes the uh deployment a lot easier so\nthe designer doesn't have to care about\nall these uh technical\ndetails and we can analyze the design\neasily in activity designer we can load\nin a session and replace uh activity\nLogs with a\nprototype we can\nalso uh use the same query language to\ngenerate the graph for example uh like\nwhat's showing\nhere so we can do some simple\nstatistical analysis in in activity uh\ndesigner we can also export the data the\nquery uh query data so we can do some\nmore analysis in other statistical\ntools okay so next I'm going to talk\nabout how I evaluated the activity\ndesigner so first first I conducted the\nelab study uh with 10 participants uh\nthe participants were asked to design\nthe key features of three\napplications uh here I would like to uh\nbriefly talk about what I found from the\nstudy so participants were able to\nfinish uh most of these tasks and we got\npositive\nfeedback in particular although none of\nuh my participants had a backround in\nactivity Theory they were able to easily\nunderstand the concepts and the\nrepresentation of uh activity\nframework excuse\nme so the study also revealed the need\nto have a more expressive way to specify\nqueries that's why that's uh that was\nthe motivation for me to ENT the query\nlanguage in the current version of\nactivity designer\nso then I conducted a lab study uh to\nevaluate the query language in\nparticular six participants were asked\nto specify queries in response to 15\nquestions in natural English for example\nfor the question has the user been in\nthe classroom of theater for five\nminutes the participants were as were\nrequired uh was required to specify the\nquery in the dialogue box like\nthis so participants were able to finish\nmost tasks without help and in\nparticular for those participants who\nhad experience in SQL and ubicom\ndevelopment uh the comment is the Creer\nlanguage is much easier than SQL and\nit's still expressive enough to specify\na a range of\nqueries activity designer has also been\nused by other researchers uh in their\ndesign projects uh such as uh for the\ndomain of uh Environmental Protection\nand social\nawareness so I talked about UB\nearlier so from these studies I found uh\nthe framework as well as a tool support\nuh the the activity designer system were\neffective for designers to describe and\nprototype ubicom applications that could\naddress large\nscale\nactivities uh I found the designer were\nable to create and deploy prototypes in\nC in just a few hours rather than a few\nmonths and uh they having be some\npositive\nresults in terms of how activity\ndesigner allows people to create new\napplications so I have released activity\ndesigner as open source so uh please\ndownload the two and give it a\ntry so in conclusion uh my research in\nthis area uh contributed two rapid\nprototype tools top\nfor prototyping location has\napplications and activity designer for\ndesign you become applications for INS\ntesting in addition to software\nartifacts uh my\nwork also contributed a activity based\nprototyping process in particular the\nactivity framework provide a new way for\ndescribing and structuring contextual\ninformation so looking forward uh I\nwould like to continue working on new\ntechnologies that allow people to\neffectively Leverage The rapidly growing\ncomputing power and information\nresources so if we look at Thea\ntrajectory of uh interaction design from\ndesktop to ubiquitous computing we\nalways trying to to incorporate more\ninformation into the design process\nright so activity designer Pro uh\nprovides a platform for activity based\ndesign so I hope to work uh to explore\nmore two support for Design uicom\nSystems that could address large scale\nactivities I also intend to empower and\nusers to be able to easily create\npersonal gadgets\nso these uh Google gadgets are actually\ncreated with activity designer uh so\nthey are fully interactive and they can\nbehave based on users activities such as\nTransportation activities and daily\nexercises right so based on my\nexperience with a activity designer I\nhope to develop uh higher level to or\nmore specialized to uh for end users to\nbe able to easily create Google gadgets\nright so we have millions of gadgets\neasily created and uh yeah so I was\nsupposed to give you a live demo but my\ncomputer crashed so I mean I can do it\nlater\nso uh another Direction I intend to work\non is the data driven design and\ndevelopment of interactive systems so as\nuser activities are getting more and\nmore complex it's very important for us\nto analyze the massive data we collect\nand uh to identify users needs and to\noptimize interaction behaviors uh these\nsystems are other projects I have been\nworking on in parallel so activity prism\nis a tool for analyzing uh people's\nbehavior uh activity patterns it\nprovides multiple ways uh ways for\npeople to look into uh activity data and\nthe cars is a system for\nautomatically extracting interaction\nlogic from testing sequences so it can\nactually uh extract is a story board\nfrom uh sequential\ndata finally uh I would like to work on\nuh activity based context where\nComputing in particular I I would like\nto study the issue of uh how to organize\nComputing and information resources\nbased on users activity the benefit here\nis uh then we can provide users with uh\ninformation Computing resources that are\nrelevant to their current activity so I\nthink uh this uh nice Google products\nsuch as I Google and Google mobile and\nGoogle Desktop they provide a great\nplatform for me to uh to explore this\nresearch\nagenda so another research area I have\nworked on back the tabs\nso planning\nvacation so are these tabs based on\nactivity is that the idea uh so actually\nthat's a good question so I I think so\nIG Google can already do something so we\ncan already do some activity based stuff\nwith IG Google so it's like each tab\nactually I I studied I Google so you\neach tab here is like uh job search\nfamily visit and planning vacation it's\nlike each tab is already like uh a\ncontainer of uh activity right so we can\nadd some relevant gadgets to that tab so\nyeah so iig Google already has an the\nnice feature of this so I think it's\nreally a nice platform to work\non um another area I have intensively\nworked on is a pen based user interfaces\nso I have worked on uh problems such as\ngesture recognition y paring and Pen\nbased mode switching so that's one uh\nexample interactive\nmotion at this point I would like to\nthank my advisor James Landy uh as well\nas my collaborators on this\nwork thanks very much and I can take\n[Applause]\nquestions question\nI so as you move you had the example of\nuh designing for designers and designing\nfor end users and you have that example\nof deploying the some you know the\ngadgets to the Enders what what do you\nhave to do to make that transition from\none group of people designers to to end\nusers is there a big difference or uh so\nlike designers\nsmarter so uh the assumption is that\nDesigner designer ERS uh have no uh so\ndesigners have more uh expertise right\nso uh so for any users uh uh we\ncertainly need to provide higher level\nsupport for them right so I think\nfor\nuh so my work has been focused on uh to\nsupport for designers\nso with these tools we can know the\ndomain better so as we know the domain\nbetter uh we can provide uh better tool\nsupport for any users so I'm not sure I\nanswer question uh yeah so so it's like\nuh the first set of tools for designers\nis more open-ended in general and then\nexact exactly so uh tools for designers\nuh so tools for any users normally the\nenvironment should be\nuh uh there should be most St\nhas been instrumented right so we can\nonly support end users to customize\ninteraction behaviors in a small uh in a\nsmaller range right for designers it's\nlike everything is from is from scratch\nso it's like white paper then I draw my\ndesign uh so these tools allow designers\nto explore a larger space uh so I think\nthat's a one of the difference uh\nbetween tools to for designers and the\ntools for and\nusers um you mentioned the Wizard of Oz\nmodel for um taking the application out\ninto the field and observing the users\non on the phone or the device or\nwhatever it is that you're you're\nlooking at the experience is there\nlogging going on or somehow just capture\nthe screen so you can see what the users\nexactly\nso all right let me um\nuh it's kind of slow but I can answer\nquestion at the same time\nso all\nright\njeez\nso we can actually record and replay a\ntest right so uh when we re replay the\ntest and we can observe how uh uh how\nmuch time a user spend on each screen\nand then we can even uh so uh the twool\ncan also show the trail the the user has\nwalked and uh we can also uh analyze the\nstoryboard transition and uh so yeah so\nit's a uh the entire test is uh recorded\nand we can re replay the test\nyeah any other questions yeah so in the\nbeginning of the presentation you\nmentioned that you know when you were\ndesigning for ubom you usually need to\ndesign very sophisticated systems I'm\njust curious like uh whether it's the\nsophisticated systems or whether it's\nmore about repurposing the existing\nsystems to work in a new context I mean\na simple example is like you know many\ntimes when we talk about like super\nhighend technology is like you know uh\nvery high very high density say storage\ndevices stuff like that so like 8 gig\ncapacity in a very small flash drive\nversus like you know even a 32 MB\noutdated flash drive might serve the\npurpose in the new context so I'm just\ntrying to figure out like you know\nwhether it's more about making use of\nthe existing systems in a new context\nversus trying to develop like super high\nfive systems from scratch and what's\nyour perspective on like this I'm just\ncurious\nuh so for this uh uh I think your\nquestion is uh uh whether we want to uh\ndesign uh entire new system from scratch\nor we want to enhance uh yeah existing\nsystems yeah essentially like you know\nwhat I'm trying to understand is when\nyou're trying to design for ubitus\ncomputing uh should you directly go for\nlike you know developing highly complex\nsystems from scratch versus trying to\nanalyze okay what are the needs that I\ntrying to serve first and then seeing\nlike you know are there enough existing\nTechnologies which can somehow support\nbecause different technologies have like\nyou know different Curves in terms of\nhow much sophistication they need right\nso that's a good question so I think as\na first first step you always want to\nunderstand the existing Technologies and\nexisting activities right so then you\nidentify what are the breakdowns in the\nexisting activities with existing uh\nTechnologies right\nso uh once we understand that uh then\nthe next thing is we want to come up\nsome we want to come up with some new\ndesigns to address those problems so\nwith these tools you can create the\nmarkups for the new systems uh you are\nthinking about then you test the new\ndesigns with a uh with users to get\nfeedback uh then the next step is uh how\ncan we realize uh the new design idea in\nthe actual settings right it could be\njust the a simple extension of the\nexisting systems or it could be uh it\ncould require us to redesign rebuild the\nwhole thing so these tools they provide\na way for people to figure that out\nright I mean that's that's actually one\nof the reasons why I like it so much\nbecause uh if you look at it from the\npoint of view of say\ndatabases it's not a very complicated\ndatabase per se it's it's a pretty\nprimitive I don't want to like you know\nsay that you know it's but it's\nrelatively primitive in terms of the\ncode database functionalities but the\nway you have repurposed it in the\ncontext of the problem that we are\ntrying to solve I think that's really\nbrilliant right so I mean thanks for\nyour comments first I so I think the\ngood thing here is so I mean the key\nthing here is uh uh we want to develop\ntools that really uh serve for the\npurpose right even very uh I mean even\nthe two is a f fantastic for one purpose\nit's it's not necessarily the right\nthing for another purpose right so uh it\nhas to be appropriate for the goal you\nyou want to achieve yeah this one last\nthing I mean uh have you actually\nthought about uh sort of scalability of\nthese tools in terms of say uh initially\nif I say develop a gadget I me\nespecially the IG Google Gadget When you\nmention it's like IG Google Gadget has\nthe capacity to be deployed or I don't\nknow maybe a couple of million people\ncan use it if you have enough adoption\nso have you thought about like how this\nuh sort of rapid prototyping tool can\nscale and and in a way it goes back to\nwhat the point which you making earlier\nyeah that's definitely a good question\nso I think one uh isue these two suffer\nis definitely scalability right so the\nuh the main purpose of these twos is uh\nis to create a mockup right to figure\nout design space to understand what you\nwant to design with for the IG Google\nthing that's something I I so basically\nin terms of scalability activity\ndesigner is much better than opary and\nuh you can you can really create a lot\nof realistic stuff with a activity\ndesigner but for that future work I\nproposed uh tools for any users to\ncreate to create Google gadgets on that\npart I intend to create uh some new tool\nsupport right like uh even higher level\ntool support for end users to easily\ncreate the final stuff that's something\nfinal it's not just the markup so\nyeah scills as well as gadgets yeah\nexactly which\nis\nokay thanks well I guess that's it thank\nyou very much thanks thanks very much\n[Applause]\n",
