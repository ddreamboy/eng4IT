  "text": "welcome back everyone this video we're\ngoing to be talking about machine\nlearning models now make sure you've\nwatched the previous two videos in the\nseries because they're going to set the\nfoundation for understanding why we use\nmachine learning and how its useful one\nof the big terms are going to hear when\nyou're studying machine learning is\nmodel and the goal of this video is to\nhave a full understanding of what a\nmodel is the previous video mentioned\nhistorical data specifically what we\ncalled a data set this is essentially a\ncrap-ton of data that sort of represents\nreality the more data the more close to\nreality we are you can think of this\ndata set as modeling reality so a model\nis just a representation of reality but\nsometimes a data set is not enough\nbecause we can't just look at a data set\nand know what's gonna happen or what\npeople are interested in or who's gonna\nhave diabetes we're not capable of\nlooking at terabytes of data and making\nthose kind of decisions so we need\nsomething more for a moment let's look\nat this data set and consider it a\nrepresentation of reality\nnow let's split that data set into a\nbunch of sections so each one of these\nsections can represent a piece of\nreality now\nI want you to think of just doing that\nas many times as you can so we're gonna\nbasically find the limit of splitting\nthis data we're going to split that as\nmany times until we have individual\nrepresentations of reality okay now I'm\ngoing to try to not be so fluffy with\nthis and be a little bit more concrete\nlet's talk about diabetes and let's say\nwe're trying to predict diabetes how do\nwe know if someone is likely to have\ndiabetes in their lifetimes\nwell this dataset is going to contain a\nlot of information about people their\nhealth history so we're gonna have a ton\nof information and if we continue to\nsplit this data to where we get down to\nlike the individual\ncells of data we're talking about one\nparticular instance of what we're trying\nto predict whether or not someone has\ndiabetes so one element in this\nhistorical data could be a person we\nhave this happy person in this data set\nwe have all their information this\nperson might be a male they might be\nunder the age of 50 and they might have\na family history of diabetes so this is\none representation of reality we might\ngrab another instance of data over here\nlet's say this one's a lady this person\nfemale she might be over 50 and no\nhistory of diabetes and in her family\nand as you continue to do this you can\nthink of all of the different\npossibilities of data inside of this\ndata set you could have the same exact\nperson who's under 50 has a history of\nfamily diabetes but is a female then you\ncould have the same exact person who's a\nmale who's greater than 50 and has no\nhistory of diabetes just think of all of\nthe different possibilities of data and\nthen we're going to represent that data\nin a table these are the columns of our\ntable and we're going to try to\nrepresent reality here now I'm just\ngonna warn you guys this is like super\nsuper simplified and that's one of the\ndownsides of teaching this is it's\nreally hard to represent reality when\nyou only have a chalkboard you more\nlikely would need an entire data set so\nthis is like getting rid of a bunch of\nimportant data and really simplifying it\nto binary yes or no male or female and\nthat's going to make it a lot more easy\nto understand so we could have male less\nthan 50 yes history of diabetes in the\nfamily yes\nwe can have mail less than 50 yes\nhistory no mail no yes and you just go\nthrough the process of getting every\nsingle combination so if we can find\npeople who have these attributes and\nknow whether or not they had diabetes\nthen we're able to model reality this\nmeans we're going to need one extra\ncolumn here and that is whether they had\ndiabetes this is why historical data is\nimportant because we need to know if the\nperson ended up getting diabetes in\ntheir lifetime we can just make data up\nall right so we have a perfect\nrepresentation of reality now you can\nthink about this as traversing a bunch\nof if statements so let me just make a\nlittle line here if you look at the\nfirst entry here of mail yes yes and no\nyou can represent that in an if\nstatement like so if sex is male and age\nis less than 50 true and history true\nthen diabetes equals false and you could\njust go one step farther and say else if\nsex equals male age less than 50 history\nI guess would be exhibition history to\ninvert it or you could say history\nequals false whatever it doesn't really\nmatter I'm not gonna get into\nprogramming concepts much right now the\npoint is you can go through and model\nreality using a simple if statement and\nyou would say that is complete because\nin our simple world we could know every\nsingle person and whether or not they're\ngoing to have diabetes using this\nhistorical data so someone comes into\nyour office and they're a female they\nare less than 50 and they have a family\nhistory of diabetes you can know before\ndoing any kind of tests you can know\nthat they are going to have diabetes\nthis is fine for data analytics we could\ndo something like this of course but the\naddictive part comes in when we do not\nhave a complete representation of\nreality the machine learning aspect of\npredictive data analytics is going to\nfind the best model even though we don't\nhave data for the entire representation\nof reality so for example if we got rid\nof these two rows now we only have a 80%\nrepresentation of reality so the machine\nlearning algorithm is going to try to\npredict if someone came in as a female\nthey were not less than 50 and they did\nhave a family history what are they\ngoing to have for diabetes that is what\nmachine learning is going to do and the\nchoice that it makes here the choice\nthat it makes here is the model once\nonce it makes all of the choices for all\nof the possibilities where we do not\nhave enough data in our data set it\nmakes all those choices and has values\nhere that is what we call our model I\nprobably just made it four thousand\ntimes more complicated and could have\njust said hey it's just a representation\nof reality based on some traversal of if\nstatements or something way simpler but\nthis is pretty good but why is this that\ncrazy well think about it when it comes\nto possibilities let's draw that out for\njust a second I'm gonna erase this if\nstatement so I can have some room we can\napproach this by asking a simple\nquestion how many models are there\navailable to choose from because there's\nonly so many representations of reality\nin our data set well in this situation\nthere's going to be four so there's four\nmodels and I'm going to write out all of\nthe possibilities if it wasn't for\nmachine learning we would have to choose\nwhich model was most appropriate but\nbecause we have a machine learning the\nalgorithm can choose which model is most\nappropriate so what we do is we\na look at the two entries where we do\nnot have data for and we write those out\nso it's a female and they're not less\nthan 50 and they do have a family\nhistory because these are binary or\nboolean attributes you could represent\nthem as true and false just as easily\nthere what I mean by that is there's\nonly two options female or male yes or\nno and yes or no so this is one\ncombination and the output could be yes\nand then we grab the other one F and and\nand the output could be yes or we could\nhave the first row be yes and the second\nrow be no or we could have the first row\nbe yes the second row be no I'm running\nout of space here so I'm gonna do it\nover here so here are all the\npossibilities 1 2 3 & 4 which one is the\nmost likely to be the good\nrepresentation of reality that is going\nto require a lot of extra effort and\nthat's why we leave it up to the machine\nlearning algorithm but just make sure\nthat you take a second to understand why\nthere's four there's four because we\ndon't have to worry about any of these\nrows we already have the data for this\nso we we just disregard those and we\njust look at the rows we don't have data\nfor there's two rows each with two\npossible values so we could have where\nthey're both yes they're both no ones\nyes ones no and then another one where\nones you have some ones no but they're\nflipped so that represents all possible\nmodels of our data oh that a lot so when\nwe write machine learning algorithms\nthey are going to pick the most likely\nsituation based on other data and those\nare the insights that I'm talking about\nthat we're not able to see as easily as\na computer\nthat's all I got for this video it was\nquite the long one so sorry about that\nbut hopefully I was helpful and I wasn't\ntrying to over complicate it all I am is\ntrying to get you guys a better\nunderstanding of what a model really is\nit is the most likely representation of\nreality when we do not have enough of\ndata to represent reality entirely so\nthank you guys for watching please be\nsure to subscribe and I will see you in\nthe next video please\n",
