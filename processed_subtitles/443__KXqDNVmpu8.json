  "text": "I'm Mike Chappell and in this shirt Mike\nexplains video we're going to talk about\nthe cyber security framework published\nby the National Institute of Standards\nand technology or nist\nnist publishes a cyber security\nframework that's free for anyone to use\nand it's very popular among cyber\nSecurity Professionals\nthe goal for the framework is to provide\na common language for understanding\nmanaging and describing cyber security\nrisks\nwith this common language organizations\ncan have more productive conversations\namong themselves and with external\nPartners such as Auditors and government\nagencies\nthe framework is also designed to help\norganizations identify and prioritize\nthe actions that they might take to\nreduce cyber security risk and to manage\nany risk that remains\nhaving a framework also helps\norganizations align their security\nactions across control types now that\nsaid the framework May mean different\nthings to different people and that's\nokay\nsome organizations May undertake the\nexercise of mapping all of their\ncontrols to the framework and building\ntheir next Generation security program\nwith the framework in mind\nOthers May simply use the framework as a\nreference to help identify whether they\nmiss any critical security controls\nyou can find the nist cyber security\nframework on the web it's a free\ndownload from nist's website\nlet's go ahead and take a look at some\nof the details of the nist cyber\nsecurity framework\nhere's a high level look at the\nframework it consists of five different\nfunctions identify protect detect\nrespond and recover\nnow these are in very very broad terms\nthe things that we all do in information\nsecurity\nthe framework then divides those\nfunctions into categories now those\ncategories aren't shown on the screen\nyet we'll take a look at them in a\nmoment\neach one of those categories is divided\ninto subcategories and then the\nframework provides references that have\ndetail about each one of those\nsubcategories\nas you can see it's really just a\nframework where you can start plugging\nin the things that you're going to do to\nachieve each of these core cyber\nsecurity functions\nhere's a look at a little more detail\nabout the framework we're now taking the\nfunctions and expanding them into\ncategories so we have five functions and\nthen 23 total categories\nfor example for the identify function\nthe cyber security framework gives six\ncategories Asset Management the business\nenvironment governance risk assessment a\nrisk management strategy and supply\nchain risk management\neach of these categories is divided into\nsubcategories that have much more detail\nbefore I explain those I just want to\ntake a moment to invite you to visit my\nwebsite at certmike.com\non that site I have free study plans put\ntogether to help you earn your next\ncyber security certification\nthe plans tied together the content that\nyou'll find in study guides video\ncourses and practice tests to help you\nprepare for your next certification exam\nand pass that test on the first try\nalso if you're enjoying this cert mic\nexplains video please take a moment to\nclick the like button below to help\nother people discover it if you\nsubscribe to my channel you'll be among\nthe first to see my new cyber security\nvideos as they come out the framework\nthen goes into a much higher level of\ndetail when you start breaking out the\nsubcategories so in the asset management\ncategory of the identify function we\nhave six sub-categories and they talk\nabout things like the inventory of\nphysical devices and systems the\ninventory of software platforms and\napplications how we map organizational\ncommunication and data flows and so on\nas you can see we're getting into the\nreal details of security here and there\nare quite a few references to other\nstandards for each one of these\nsubcategories for people who are looking\nfor more detail on how you might go\nabout achieving these goals\nnow remember what you're looking at here\nis the detail for one category of one\nfunction\nremember there are five different\nfunctions and 23 total categories so\nthis cyber security framework winds up\nbeing a very lengthy document\nsecurity control Frameworks play an\nimportant role in information security\nWhile most organizations don't follow\nthem letter for letter these Frameworks\ndo provide a useful tool for Designing\nthe appropriate controls for any\norganization\n[Music]\n",
