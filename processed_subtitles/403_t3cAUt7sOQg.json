  "text": "hello i'm dale from geckoboard and today\ni'm going to give you 12 tips that will\nhelp you design the perfect dashboard\n[Music]\ndata data data businesses today are\nsurrounded by data which is nice but\nit's not that helpful if you need to\nmake quick decisions this is where\ndashboards can help dashboards take your\nmost important data and present it in a\nway where you can easily tell what's\ngoing on at a glance\nbecause dashboards need to get across\ninformation quickly and efficiently the\ndesign and layout of the dashboard\nbecomes all that more important by the\nend of this video you're going to have\nthe knowledge to design quality\ndashboards that let people know exactly\nwhat's going on\nso the most important piece of advice we\nhave is to be clear about what it is\nyou're trying to achieve with your\ndashboard\nwho is this dashboard for\nhow will it help with the decision\nmaking are they trying to monitor some\nkind of system or process or perhaps\nthey're trying to track the progress\ntowards a goal\nso the clearer you are on the purpose of\nyour dashboard the easier it's going to\nbe to know what data to include and how\nto present it\nthink of data communication like a game\nof catch\nthe better you throw the ball\nthe easier it is for the other person to\ncatch it the most common mistake\ndesigners make is overloading the user\nwith information\nin other words they throw too many balls\nat once\nthink carefully about the audience of\nthis dashboard do they need to see a\ndetailed breakdown of each customer\naccount every time they look at the\ndashboard or would a high level number\nbe sufficient\nthe key here is working with your\naudience\nsure you need to understand what they do\nneed but you also need to understand\nwhat they don't need and then you need\nto be bold in deciding what to leave out\nanother way to improve your dashboard\ndesign is by reducing the amount of\nvisual noise now the american\nstatistician edward tuft actually coined\na term for this concept data ink ratio\ndata inc is quite literally the ink that\ncommunicates your data\nwhereas non-data inc is the stuff that\ndoesn't\nthese days you're unlikely to be\nprinting out your visualizations with\nink but the principle still applies\nwell-designed dashboards aim to use as\nlittle non-data ink as possible in other\nwords they have a good data ink ratio\nin practice this means removing\nunnecessary grid lines\nicons\ncolor\nlabels or anything else that doesn't\nactually communicate data\nwhat you will find is that looking at\ndashboards with a bad data rank ratio is\nincredibly hard work for the user\nespecially if they're looking at this\ndashboard several times a day\ndecorative elements may grab your\nattention the first time you look at a\ndashboard but the novelty very quickly\nwears off and over time these things\njust start to get in the way\noverly precise numbers can actually slow\ndown our comprehension\nideally you should round your numbers to\na point where the differences between\nfigures represent a material change as\nyou can see here abbreviations can also\nmake it easier to understand what's\ngoing on\nokay so tell me which is bigger red or\nblue\nneed more time\nokay now try\neasier right\nwhen selecting a visualization you\nshould always choose the one which most\nclearly and efficiently communicates the\ndata\nthat means it should take as little time\nas possible to understand what's going\non\nin general we humans aren't very good at\ncomparing and contrasting spatial area\nthat means that pie charts and area\ncharts are rarely the best choice of\nvisualization\ni know it can be tempting to choose a\ndifferent visualization just because we\nwant to spice things up a little bit but\njust don't do it if choosing the right\nvisualization means choosing the same\nvisualization then that's fine you're\ndoing your job most of the time you're\ngoing to be using a combination of\nnumbers bars lines and tables\nokay so when i was a kid before eating\nthings like m m's i would often group\nthem according to color\ni was a pretty weird kid\nbut at least this type of worrying\nbehavior makes you more likely to be a\ngood dashboard designer in the future\nwhy because good dashboards group\nrelated metrics\nso if somebody wants to see the metrics\nrelated to revenue don't make them look\nhere and here and here\ninstead group them plus you save on\nnon-data inc because now you need less\nlabels\nif you have a related group of metrics\nit's helpful to be consistent in your\nchoice of visualization for example\nlet's take a look at this dashboard\nso here we have the number of orders\neach day and here we have the value of\nthose orders\nclearly there's a relationship between\nthese metrics\nso we're going to want to use the same\nvisualization to help the user\nunderstand that relationship\nagain don't worry if this feels like\nyou're being repetitive what you're\nactually doing is helping people think\nabout related metrics in the same way\nnot all kpis are equal and a good\ndashboard should reflect there\nif there's a metric you want people to\npay attention to\nmake it bigger put it in the top left\nhand corner\nthe top left hand corner is where our\neyes are naturally drawn\nfollowed by the other edges of the\ndashboard\nnumbers on their own don't actually tell\nus that much let's say yesterday's\nrevenue is five thousand dollars\nis that good bad normal unusual how does\nit compare to last week has it gone up\nhas it gone down how does it compare to\nour targets\ngiving context to a number in the form\nof a status indicator or a comparison\ncan quickly tell us the significance of\nthat number just be aware of the first\nrule too many status indicators can\ncreate noise if your entire dashboard is\nred and green then the significance of\nthose colors is greatly reduced\nsimilarly a number of a chart isn't very\nuseful if we don't know what it\nrepresents use labels to clearly state\nwhat the metric represents and also what\ntime span\nyour label should be clear and concise\navoid notes explanations and caveats\nthese things might feel like they're\nhelpful the first time somebody uses a\ndashboard but it very quickly becomes\nvisual noise\nso far in this video we've covered 10\nrules for designing the perfect\ndashboard but the thing about design\nrules\nlike all rules is that they're made to\nbe broken at the end of the day\ndashboard design is about more than just\nhow efficiently you can lay data out on\na 16x9 rectangle\nultimately it's about people it's about\nto what extent you can get those people\nto engage with the information\nand sometimes the most engaging\ndashboards do break the rules for\nexample at geckoboard one of our company\ndashboards includes a list of recent\nsubscribers\nin a strict design sense it's probably\nnot as important as some of the other\nelements on this dashboard\nbut we include it because it sparks\nconversations and increases engagements\nwith the dashboard overall so whether\nit's a twitter feed new deals or a daily\ncat gif remember that it's okay to break\nthe rules if it means that people engage\nwith your dashboard just don't overdo it\nthe last thing to say is that you should\nkeep tweaking and evolving your\ndashboard the best way to tell if you've\ndesigned a great dashboard is by using\nit does it help people do what it's\nsupposed to do make sure you continue to\nlisten to feedback because when it comes\nto dashboards you can always improve\nso there we have it 12 tips for\ndesigning the perfect dashboard now all\nthe lessons um we've covered today are\napplicable to any form of dashboard\ndesign but you may have noticed that in\nmany of the examples i've been using our\nvery own dashboard tool geckoboard\ngeckoboard makes it easy to create\nprofessional kpi dashboards it connects\nwith over 80 data sources and it's just\nmuch easier to use than many of the\ncomplicated bi tools out there and one\nof the best parts is that geckoboard is\nbuilt with all of these design practices\nin mind so it makes it very very hard to\ngo wrong so if you're looking to build\ndashboards in a matter of minutes then\nhead over to geckoboard.com and sign up\nfor a free trial\nyou'll be making dashboards within\nwithin no time at all otherwise i hope\nyou enjoyed this video um if you did\nplease like and subscribe to the channel\nand if you've got any questions about\ndashboard design about geckoboard just\nleave them in comments i will get back\nto you thank you once again and have a\ngreat day\n[Music]\n",
