  "text": "What is natural language processing? Well, \nyou're doing it right now, you're listening  \nto the words and the sentences that I'm forming \nand you are forming some sort of comprehension  \nfrom it. And when we ask a computer to do that \nthat is NLP, or natural language processing.  \nMy name is Martin Keen, I'm \na Master Inventor at IBM,  \nand I've utilized NLP in a good number of \nmy invention disclosures. NLP really has a  \nreally high utility value in all sorts of AI \napplications. Now NLP starts with something called  \nunstructured text. What is that? Well, that's \njust what you and I say, that's how we speak.  \nSo, for example, some unstructured text is \n\"add eggs and milk to my shopping list.\"  \nNow you and I understand exactly what that means, \nbut it is unstructured at least to a computer.\nSo what we need to do, is to have a structured \nrepresentation of that same information that  \na computer can process. Now that might look \nsomething a bit more like this where we have a  \nshopping list element. And then it has sub \nelements within it like an item for eggs,\nand an item for milk.\nThat is an example of \nsomething that is structured.\nNow the job of natural language processing \nis to translate between these two things.  \nSo NLP sits right in the middle here translating \nbetween unstructured and structured data. And when  \nwe go from structure from unstructured here \nto structured this way, that's called NLU, or  \nnatural language understanding. And when we \ngo this way from structured to unstructured,  \nthat's called natural language generation, \nor NLG. We're going to focus today primarily  \non going from unstructured to structured in \nnatural language processing now let's think of  \nsome use cases where nlp might be quite handy. \nFirst of all, we've got machine translation.\nNow when we translate from one language to \nanother we need to understand the context of  \nthat sentence. It's not just a case of taking \neach individual word from say English and  \nthen translating it into another language. We \nneed to understand the overall structure  \nand context of what's being said. And my \nfavorite example of this going horribly wrong  \nis if you take the phrase the \"spirit is willing, \nbut the flesh is weak\" and you translate that from  \nEnglish to Russian and then you translate \nthat Russian translation back into English  \nyou're going to go from the \"spirit is willing, \nbut the flesh is weak\" to something a bit more  \nlike the \"vodka is good, but the meat is \nrotten\" which is really not the intended  \ncontext of that sentence whatsoever. So \nNLP can help with situations like that. Now  \nthe the second kind of use case that I like \nto mention relates to virtual assistants,  \nand also to things like chatbots. Now a virtual \nassistant that's something like Siri, or Alexa  \non your phone that is taking human utterances and \nderiving a command to execute based upon that. And  \na chatbot is something similar except in written \nlanguage and that's taking written language and  \nthen using it to traverse a decision tree in order \nto take an action. NLP is very helpful there.  \nAnother use case is for sentiment analysis. Now \nthis is taking some text perhaps an email message  \nor a product review and trying to derive \nthe sentiment that's expressed within it.  \nSo for example, is this product review a positive \nsentiment or a negative sentiment, is it written  \nas a serious statement or is it being sarcastic? \nWe can use NLP to tell us. And then finally,  \nanother good example is spam detection so this \nis a case of looking at a given email message  \nand trying to drive is this a real email \nmessage or is it spam and we can look for  \npointers within the content of the message. So \nthings like overused words or poor grammar or an  \ninappropriate claim of urgency can all indicate \nthat this is actually perhaps spam. So those are  \nsome of the things that NLP can provide but how \ndoes it work well the thing with NLP is it's\nnot like one algorithm, it's actually more like a \nbag of tools and you can apply these bag of tools  \nto be able to resolve some of these use cases. \nNow the input to NLP is some unstructured text  \nso either some written text or spoken text that \nhas been converted to written text through a  \nspeech to text algorithm. Once we've got that, \nthe first stage of NLP is called tokenization\nThis is about taking a string and breaking \nit down into chunks so if we consider the  \nunstructured text we've got here \"add \neggs and milk to my shopping list\"  \nthat's eight words that can be eight tokens.  \nAnd from here on in we are going to work one \ntoken at a time as we traverse through this. Now  \nthe first stage once we've got things down into \ntokens that we can perform is called stemming.\nAnd this is all about deriving the word stem \nfor a given token. So for example, running,  \nruns, and ran, the word stem for all three of \nthose is run. We're just kind of removing the  \nprefix and the suffixes and normalizing the \ntense and we're getting to the word stem.  \nBut stemming doesn't work well for every \ntoken. For example, universal and university,  \nwell they don't really stem down to \nuniverse. For situations like that,  \nthere is another tool that we have \navailable and that is called lemmatization.  \nAnd lemmatization takes a given token and learns \nits meaning through a dictionary definition  \nand from there it can derive its root, or its lem. \nSo take better for example, better is derived from  \ngood so the root, or the lem, of better is good. \nThe stem of better would be bet. So you can see  \nthat it is significant whether we use stemming, \nor we use lemmatization for a given token.  \nNow next thing we can do is we can do a \nprocess called part of speech tagging.\nAnd what this is doing is for a given token \nit's looking where that token is used within the  \ncontext of a sentence. So take the word make for \nexample, if I say \"I'm going to make dinner\", make  \nis a verb. But if I ask you \"what make is your \nlaptop?\", well make is now a noun. So where that  \ntoken is used in the sentence matters, part of \nspeech tagging can help us derive that context.  \nAnd then finally, another stage \nis named entity recognition.  \nAnd what this is asking is for a given token \nis there an entity associated with it. So  \nfor example, a token of Arizona has an entity of a \nU.S. state whereas a token of Ralph has an entity  \nof a person's name. And these are some of the \ntools that we can apply in this big bag of tools  \nthat we have for NLP in order to get from this \nunstructured human speech through to something  \nstructured that a computer can understand. And \nonce we've done that then we can apply that  \nstructured data to all sorts of AI applications. \nNow there's obviously a lot more to it than this  \nand I've included some links in the description if \nyou'd like to know more, but hopefully this made  \nsome sense and that you were able to process some \nof the natural language that I've shared today.  \nThanks for watching.
