  "text": "all right so yes finally I'm bishar I'm\nhaving like overall so 12 plus years\nnearly like you know 14 years of\nexperience in this multiple domains of\nexperience currently I work in Google as\na cyber security engineer and again mine\nis like completely Cloud sof security\nengineer and again where I need to go\nwith like to like application security\nnetwork security data security Cloud\nsecurity un information security\nsecurity under compliance and governance\nall the things I us to go with on this\nright so now one of the interesting\ntopics we also doing with AI and ml data\nsecurity how we can go with hand to hand\nimplementations with the secure\ndevelopment life cycle policies so how\ncan we use and again what the tools we\ncan going to use for like know Ai and ml\nConcepts like know idas tools intr\ndetection systems and again prevention\nsystem tools also we can use endpoint\nproduction systems like know example\nlike a sentinel Microsoft Sentinel we\ncan use that one and you can also like\nknow security information and again\nevent management tools we're using like\nknow spunk here\nespecially and again also like we using\nlike know threat intelligence platforms\nlike especially working with like threat\nconnects I mean threat models especially\nand also like know fishing deductions\nand we are more focusing on like know\ndata loss prevention techniques how can\nwe prevent this one with the semantic so\nto understanding this semantic we should\nknow first know secure development life\ncycle with data loss prevention policies\nthose are like know how to identify for\nthe data identifications with know\nfinancial\ndata Phi datas know any kind of like how\nto implement with data protection roles\nlike know preventive controls and\nmonitoring controls and user roles and\npermission levels transfer policies\nlevels and again incident responses\nlevels all these things that will be\nthis is like one of the major topics in\nthe\nAIML this is one of the cyber security\nconcepts with nowadays it is a newly\nimplementing to the AIML because you\nthese are the algorithms and again these\nare the models what came\nrecently right so again we are going to\nuse the tools here especially Splunk IBM\nC and also like we using like idps tools\nlike core impact also right anyway that\nwe will be discussing in the later point\nnow uh last but least utkus so hi\nutkus hello\nhello\nhello are you\nthere is it\naible\nhello you're\naudible yeah exctly thank you mankos how\nabout you\nI think is in\nM okay this is a demo class of\ncompletely cyber security and what the\nsecurity and again you guys know that\nright so what are the Securities we are\ndoing this implementations all these\nthings now meanwhile to understand this\nareas what is cyber security first thing\nwhy we need to learn this cyber security\nand again what is the difference between\ncyber security and again ethal hacking\nall this\nplay right and what are the types of\nsties we\nhave all the things we can see\nnow is it my screen is\nvisible hello yeah it's a zoom actually\nyeah now came up okay we'll go with to\nunderstand with I make you to\nunderstand simple\ncyber security how PP and P send the\ndocumentations cyber security and list\nthe types of cyber\nsecurity simple\nokay so we have completely cyber\nsecurity is nothing but in simple way to\nunderstand cyber security is a umbrella\nand in the umbrella when we open the\numbrella there is a n number of threads\nwill come H and spoke right those SP\nwork are called as a network security\napplication security information\nsecurity endpoint security Cloud\nsecurity identity access management and\noperational security disaster recovery\nand cryptography incident responses\nsecurity awar training and again\nphysical security and again is the data\nsecurity here data security is like one\nmore area\nOkay more I'll show this Lee think the\ntypes mobile security iot devices\nsecurity yes this is what especially in\nthe mod cases you should more deeper\ninto the data security and again data L\nprevention stuff okay and P policies\nalso all these things like we should\npractice on this right and again\ncritical infos security how to maintain\nand again web security how to do this\nand again print testing again how to do\nthis one assessment and can threat\nintelligence and blockchain and is one\nno need to do this yes forensic inent\nanalysis this is very important and\nagain red team and again blue team\ndepending upon the which team you are\ngoing to work on this that is very\nimportant thing you need to understand\nand again identity access management and\nagain governance level especially this\nis the top most priority section\nespecially in the data L prion\nimplementations right these are the\ntypes of Securities like example if I\ngive like more still show\nme here comes like you know artificial\nintelligence am and again ml Securities\ninvolving like using Ai and machine\nlearning algorithms to detect anomal and\ncan predict threats automate responses\nso all this things\nOkay C if I show this small example on\nthis\ncase and\nml this\nsee this is what we need to focus like\nespecially applications of AI and again\nml security thre detections by default\nwe can use snot tools any kind of Spun\ntools and you can also Juniper Networks\nall these\nthings right and can fishing detections\nand again by default Mal Anis yes user\nand again entity Behavior analytics\ndefault vulnerab management World\nnotability management thre intelligence\nall these things clear\nso this is what I end to end we focusing\nmeanwhile\nhere first thing we can go with the\ndeeper level see\nnetwork security in the firewall mode we\ncan use this tools so follow hard and\nCisco AI 4 we can download the free\ntools we can do with this firewalls we\ncan use and again idps interion\ndetection system prevention systems and\nagain we can use this open source\ntools VPN we can use openvpn or cisq\nconnect endpoint security we can use\nstic make Cafe and endpoint detection\nand ding we can use like Crow strike Pon\nor El\nSentinal see right now we are using\nSentinal here so okay one again I'll\nshow this in my company sentinol see\nsentinol one is already it is installed\nC right so whatever I'm doing the\ntracking and again how to prevent this\nall theas will be pring it see I click\non this\nSentinel so it is already running but I\ndon't want to open this one\nnow right then again application\nsecurity definitely we are going to use\nver code sonar both and th we can use\nWhatsApp B both the rols and SSO we\nusing SSO and Can Microsoft Azure with o\nl multiactor authentications yes we are\nusing and in Pam also we going to use\ncber or all this tools but depending\nupon like which security you have to\nfocus see as a cyber security engineer\nyou should have all this knowledge but\nin a companies you'll be going to work\nonly the specific domain if you\napplication security working the\napplication security\nand again data security team you'll be\nthe data security team right then again\nincident responses team vulnerability\nmanagement team thre intelligence team\nforeign investigation team security\nawareness training team something like\nknow a and again ml teams see here\nthread detections see a ml what and all\nwe are going to do thre detections\ninsent responses also we can do fishing\ndetections and malware Anis just I'm\nusing the charart GPD to make you to\nunderstand what exactly the tools we are\ngoing to use and again here we are going\nto use all the tools this tools is\ncommonly used for normal security also a\nml tools also we going to use and again\nmanagement again we can use like know\neither K security these are like know\nopen source tools and can intelligence\nall\nthis in the a ml only we having like\nthre detections insurent responses\nfishing detections malware analysis\nunder vulnerability management all these\nthings right\nany questions here up to\nhere Vish are we going to learn about\nethical hacking as well or is it comes\nunder\ncyber security or a different domain no\ncomes that is a different Ealing is\ndifferent again it comes under only the\ncyber security how to prevent this all\nthese things so all the domains we going\nto work in the all these domains we\ngoing to work in the a cloud see suppose\nwe don't have un promis INF right now\nI'll show\nthis all these\ntools\ncompare all\nthese types of\nand\ntools comparing this Azure gcp in table\nformat\nexample see suppose in the on\npremises\nokay for\nlet see\nsee these are the open source tools\nwe're going to use like no snot if\nsuppose network security in the databas\nCloud suppose take an example in databas\nCloud we can log into the databas cloud\nsee now it is all what is the cloud\nbasically cloud is a collection of\ndomains if someone is working in the\ndatabase domain if someone is working\nwith the network domain how to make the\nnetwork security data security and\ndatabase security and the application\nsecurity the on premises they will do\nbut in the cloud multiple domains will\nbe deployed there and you can how to do\nthis all this domain\nsecurity make it not one\nsecond yeah each and every tool we\nshould learn network security identity\naccess management data protections\nendpoint security thread detections and\nagain responses application security\ncompliance and governance one management\ninent responses encryptions monitoring\nloging so these are the tools these are\nthe open source tools we going to use\nand on top of this open source\ntool on top of this open source tool\nwe're going to use AWS property tools\ncompare compare the tools\nfor\neach types of\nSecurities\nfor Azure\nGC see example take an example network\nsecurity open source tool where you're\ngoing to use snot and what is the\nbenefit here inion detection and again\nprevention systems detects and again\nprevent insurances uses what is use\ncases protects Network and again from\nMal no is suppose I'm going to use notot\nevery day and again this C also we can\ngoing to use this one for container\napplications definitely we are going to\nuse\nsnot snot and again key clock open L we\nare going to use this two for Iden\naccess management for data Pro open SSL\nj&v PG also two things we can use\nendpoint security definitely CC and\nagain CS we're going to use open DXL and\nin the I we can use application security\ntwo things I'm going to use here open Z\nand again busit Cloud security scan if\nyou want we can use and again compliance\nand\ngovernance we can use\nhere open\nSC and sc one Management Open b n to\nboth instant expenses again the I only\nand encrytion SSL from this Gra\nsuppose on top of this we also need to\nlearn like there's a sad Cloud if I\nclick on this so\nsuppose if I click on cloud security\npost management cloud mapper and again\nconfigurations of this and again\nsecurity monkey and\nokay okay see this also we should learn\nhere see Cloud security post management\nthis is a open source tool Cloud we\nshould use and you can also cloud map\nthis is helps you to analyze your head\nservices within the diagram and will be\nfinding the complet one the output looks\nlike this okay then again CCPA is\nnothing but C right confidential\nIntegrity availability right so how to\nuse this one all these cases next Cloud\nmapper it is a security monkey monitor\nfor red gcp and open\nSt clear the output looks like this\nand again last one security\nTOS cloud\nmapper cloud mapper is already a\nshown yes Cloud\nmapper this show\nF okay\nnow this the types of\nSecurities\ninws Azure gcp and open source\ntools\nequalent yes see now it CES perfect so\nnow open source snot surata pfSense if\nwe use the snot in the code we going to\nuse Ed firewall manager Shar with Shi in\nthe Azure Azure firewall Azure D and the\nGoogle code Google code armor and VPC\nservice control\nokay the thing is why today the market\nis more important in the cloud security\nbecause all the companies are moving to\nthe cloud and even though in the\ngovernment sees they Appo the\napplication to the cloud areas right so\nthat's why in the a this Services we\nshould learn but here I'm going to take\ntwo clouds one is another one is either\nJP either azure here and again identity\naccessment first we should learn open\nsource tool how to use this one key\nclock open ad app then again in I\nam am how to use and C how to use for\nthat you should know basic understanding\nof the Aus\nCloud play right\neveryone what is the prerequisite for\nthis uh\ntraining the prerequisite you should\nknow one of the thing mainly OS layer OS\nbasic networking skills we should have\nand again basic operating system skills\nwe should have and again basic python\nscripting we should have on top of that\nif I if I'm opening the network security\nthe end to end CCNA knowledge we should\nhave that will be covered here\nonly clear\nit yes clear clear hello yes with yes\nsir are we going to learn\nmetwork yes default tools metal spit B\nsuit snot right and again all the open\nsource tools and again all the open\nsource source tools how to implement\ninto the a cloud those are completely\nCloud Securities with a multiple domains\nwith open source\ntools okay okay sir\nright yes sir\ndo do you have a day wise syllabus or\nsomething where we can go through like\nknow how\nit know continue how we'll continue it\nare you guys planning for weekend bches\nor weekday bches if it is all\nwell actually uh see I'll tell you as\nfor seeing the syllabus whatever you\nlike know that is that is I feel that is\nlike know pretty big so I don't think\nthat 10 weekend batches will or five\nweekend batches will accomodate\neverything I think weekday batches only\nI'll be looking for so anything you are\nlike is there please let me know yeah\nplease you know one thing cyber security\nis a vast area and in meanwhile network\nsecurity minimum it will takes two two\nweeks because I want to understand how\nto use the open source tools and yes I\ncan understand like by using the open\nsource tools this is good now now if I\nuse the load how to implement the open\nsource tools and also how to use the AWS\nprerequisite AWS property tools how to\nuse network security two weeks identity\naccess management two weeks at least one\nweek for that data production one week\nendpoint security exactly three days we\nrequired thre detection and responses 3\ndays application security we required\nlike one week compliance and governance\n3 days is enough vulnerability\nmanagement teams two days is enough\ninent responses two days encryptions\ndefinitely request minimum 3 to four\ndays monitoring logging it requ know one\nday but to implement and again to\ncapture it but this is more again\ncompliance governance one more and again\nperameter security physical security\nCloud security there like any number of\nsecurity suppose take an example now as\na udai yes boss I don't want to learn\nall the Securities I want to focus only\nthat is a mo requirement I want to focus\nonly data productions for this data\nProductions how long it will take for\nthis data Productions I can take only\nthree weekends that's like two weekends\ntwo two hours classes three weekends but\ncyber security why I made with a less\npackage of 15,000 rupes to learn all the\nSecurities because you guys today is a\nworld because whichever the field might\nbe get what is it lesser jobs or there\nmight be like a lot of firing but\nespecially in the cyber security it will\nbe keep on extending the jobs more and\nmore right now in India less skilled\npeople especially in the government\nsectors they require more cyber security\nengineer\nif we have this cyber security tag we\ncan rule like anything for that we\nshould understand like end to end cyber\nsecurity types C right after that\nethical acing see this is the cyber\nsecurity we should use all the tools why\nwe are going to use all the tools\nbecause whatever I did suppose if I\ncreated a network suppose take an\nexample if I created a Willa in my place\nfor that Willa if I kept the compound\nwhether that compound is correct or not\nand again if anyone is penetrating my\ncompound wall or not and again if anyone\nis if anyone is jumping to the my\ncompound how many of them are jumping\nand how to know all the things we are\ndoing with a physical security right\nthat physical security we dealing with\neither security either security guards\neither CCTV cameras but in this case if\nI create a application suppose take an\nexample data Productions in the data\nProductions if I get the data from the\nbanking database how can the data will\nbe transferred with the secure mode so\nfor that we should know the encryptions\nand again withl format so those are the\nthings we should understand this are the\nvery very prerequisite to get the\nknowledge play right this is like\nmaximum as a weekend batches if you want\nto join weekend batches also we can join\nor else if you want to join to my\npersonal batches the same fees also here\nthat will be 9 months sorry 3\nmonths\nright what are the timings for your\nbatch no if because already two batches\nare running the morning batch it is one\nweek is over for that but if you guys\nare okay to join\neveryone so I planning for like know\nnight\ntime in my IST night\ntime around what time to what time Bally\nso night time of the timings will be uh\nI'm planning for like uh 10:30 I mean\nyeah 10 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. 10 p.m. to\n11:30\np.m. you don't have anything like now\nlittle before like 6:30 7:00 around\nthere is availability time but you know\nI'm doing with one data list dat classes\nthere it is the ending of like you know\nafter five days it will keep on ending\nthat in that batch if you want I can\nschedle that Tims 6:30 to\n7:30 uh I think that is suitable for\nme how about\nmoan sir but uh if if we skip any\nsession then we will recording sorry if\nI am unable to join the session\nand we will get recorded recorded video\nyes s this will be regularly will be\navailable okay then no\nproblem\nready how about\nmoan evening 6:30 to 7:30 right yeah 72\n8:30 we can plan it like this yeah 728\n8:30 that\nI'm okay with that okay then\nudk\nomaran yeah I'm also okay yeah for you\nalso right yeah yes\nyes one one more question I have sorry\none more question I have actually like\nknow you have a syllabus like know PDF\nor something can you put it on chat or\nsomething we'll download it and see and\nsecond thing what is the prerequisite in\nterms of Hardware or anything else like\nknow required so you have to inform us\nso we have to arrange or something like\nthat yeah so now the hardware is you\nshould have a good laptop there and and\nagain for network security one\nmanagement no need to buy any rotor\nswitches just everything we can use in\nthe CL because in the a load everything\nthere is a multiple domain see be\ndevops dat Ops MLS\nwish\npassword three four\npass see here we do have multiple\ndomains here we have multiple domains\nsuppose if I take the one domain\nnetworking content domain in this\nnetworking content domain I want to I'm\ngoing to share my knowledge on premises\ntool how to implement and again\nmeanwhile you should understand the if\nit is if I'm working with the networking\nlevel how the UN premises networking\nrouters switches how they configure\nsubnets how they configure public IPS\nand again private subnets all these\nthings we can go with like VPC level R\n53 private gateways all these things\nfirst I will show this one then again\nafter that I will go to that for each\ndomain this is one\nthing\nit yes correct\nokay I'll share my syab one second\nsyllabus I\nkept now the sessions will be conducted\non week days right yes yes so if you\nwant like not tomorrow like on small\ndemo if you want to see with the\npractically we can also see thator\npractically if you guys sfed you guys\ncan pay the Fe to the d s and actually\nmy personal bades I charge nearly 65,000\nfor three month three and half months of\nthis completely service security with\nmultiple but the soft is my\ncollaboration I mean NE so that's why\nknow he's telling that to support so\nthat's why the same pH I'm taking and\nagain I'm merging my personal students\nand I'm merging this dof students and\nagain there's there's no P discussion\nonly the technical challenges\ndiscussions and again the more advanced\ntechnology discussion that is what like\nI'm doing this\nand okay\nokay because generally my personal\nbatches I do stay in Bangalore I charge\nfor each stent 65,000 with the security\nthree and a half\nmonths but luckily your bches like three\nto four members will be there extra\nplease uh don't communicate with this\nwhat that Financial\nstuff sure sure no problem we will not\nwhat are the career opportunities in Cy\nsec I'm now playing the delivery\nRo\nsorry carer opportunities like how we\ncan grow in this okay I want to\nunderstand know small thing uh in which\ndomain currently you are in I mean what\nis the role you are\nhandling I'm currently playing a\ndelivery manager role managing a\nprojects for uh retail supply chain the\napplications are uh built on Java micros\nservices and the server application\neverything is posted on your cloud and\nuh they are also you know supporting\nproducts for demand forecasting and\ngeneration order generation and we are\nalso exploring AI tools and uh building\na small a\napplication know managing all the\nprojects\nokay got it got\nit\nokay so it's me CLE so don't worry about\nthat I understand the career opportunity\nwill be like huge career opties and\nespecially you are a delivery manager\nand In This Cloud Securities you can\nlearn all the cyber security types and\nthe tools and how to do this what is iel\nbut I understand as a delivery manager\nthere's no time to learn like end of the\nyear meanwhile you can have intermediate\nknowledge and again the high level\nknowledge on this and again as a\ndelivery manager right now in the\nindustry especially in the cloud\nsecurity they required like more\ncompliance and governance in that domain\nyou can go that is also the part of\ncyber security there that is also one of\nthe type of security if you know\napplication security network security\ndata L preventions and data security and\nEndo security compliance and governance\nthis five out of 18 18 to 20 types of\nsecurity these five types of security if\nyou have there's a huge demand in the\nmarket and you can double the package\nexample if your packages 40 at least you\ncan demand like now 50 percentage\nminimum 75\nplus so for that if you want any kind of\nfor that if you want like any kind of\ninstructions all these things I'll be\nsupporting for\nthat and will you also support to\nprepare any certification in this B\nyeah CSP you can go\nthat see right now example there's one\nreal time scenario yesterday in my one\nof the cloud I have launched like 10\nservers in one server I got like know\nthis are the one I want to find out\nwhich servers and again I need to update\nlike all the patches here like this for\nthat the is asking like one of the good\nquestion what is the prequit yes\noperating system Linux should be know\nyou should know like thly L commands and\nin the second thing you should know\nnetworking basic commands networking\nConcepts basic Linux commands basic\nLinux voice and in the basic python\nscripting and all the Securities that's\nwhat I know the first two weeks I'm\ntaking the basic networking Concepts\nunderstanding and in the operating\nsystem Linux commands all these things\nright yeah thanks yes clear yes sir if\nhe doesn't know that one then no need to\nlearn service security because please\nsee right now I'm finding the one vulner\nhere right so to find out this one one\nvulner they're telling that like we\nshould install this patch we should\nupdate this patches and again I cannot\nable to copy like one by one line and\nagain I can run write a python code to\nto install all the patches at the\ntime right so that's why the first tutor\nis the basic Linux basic Lin supporting\nsystem concept networking Concepts then\nagain basic python introduction and\nagain meanwhile some shell scripting\nthen again we can go with like know our\napplication Security One topic network\nsecurity one topic data security one\ntopic and INF Security One topic\ninformation security other topic and\nagain Cloud security all these\nthings thank you everyone so we'll\nconnect again tomorrow and again we'll\nunderstand this Concepts okay\n",
