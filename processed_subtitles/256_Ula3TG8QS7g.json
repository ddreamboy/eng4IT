  "text": "here's an understatement for you cyber\nsecurity is really hard it feels like\nthere's millions of moving Parts how do\nyou know if you've got all the bases\ncovered well the good news is the US\nNational Institute of Standards also\nknown as nist created a cyber security\nframework that will give you a general\nidea of whether you've done all the\nright things or not this is something\nyou can use to build your cyber security\nprogram with and in the first version of\nthis it included categories like\nidentify protect detect respond and\nrecover and in the 2.0 version which is\nabout to come out they added another\nlayer the governance layer so let's take\na look so the cyber security framework\nis really expansive I'm not going to\nhave time to cover the whole thing but\nI'm going to hit just a few of the high\npoints to give you a general idea of\nwhat it's about let's take a look at\nthis first one the governance layer that\nwas recently added in this one it says\nwe need to take a look at our\norganizational context understand what\nwhat's the mission of the the\norganization what are the goals what is\nit we're trying to achieve then we take\na look at risk this is a big one also\nyou need to understand what is the\norganization's tolerance for risk or\ntheir appetite for risk how much do you\nwant to take on how much are you going\nto be risk averse because that's going\nto affect a lot of other things um we\nneed to figure out who is responsible\nfor doing what there are various roles\nthat people will have in this\norganization and then ultimately develop\npolicies and procedures that will\ncorrespond to this a lot of\norganizations start with developing\npolicies and I'm going to suggest they\nshould start with the risk because\nunderstanding your risk will affect all\nof these other things now we've set the\nstage with the big picture of governance\nnow let's identify what it is that we\nneed to protect what are we going to\nidentify we're going to identify assets\nthat need to be protected what are the\nassets that we're going to try to\nprotect well it's going to be things\nlike data it's going to be Hardware it's\ngoing to be software it's going to be\npeople think about that in terms of\nidentities not the actual individuals\nthemselves that's a different subject\nbut these are the things we have to take\na look at so when I need a capability\nthat helps me identify what all of those\nthings are and tracks those assets uh in\nsome cases to do Dynamic discovery of\ndata and classifying it so that I know\nwhere the sensitive stuff is then we\nalso need to identify what some of the\nrisks are we call that risk analysis and\nin a risk analysis one of the things\nwe'll take a look at is the idea of\nattack surface management and\nvulnerability analysis these are a\ncouple of things that we have to do the\nattack surface that's the whole area\nwhere the bad guy could potentially get\nto us we need to make sure that we know\nwhat all of those open switches might be\nso that we can close them and we need to\nfind out where the vulnerabilities exist\nnow how do we protect these things well\nremember our old friend if you've seen\nsome of my other videos where I talk\nabout the CIA Triad that deals with\nconfidentiality integrity and\navailability these are the Hallmarks of\nwhat we're trying to do to protect\nthings in a cyber security environment I\nwant to make sure that sensitive stuff\nis only available to the people that are\nsupposed to have it it's confidential\nthat it can't be tampered with it has\nintegrity and that it's available to the\npeople that need it so that's our goal\nwell what kind of things can we put in\nplace to do that well we're going to use\nthings like cryptography because in in\ncrypting information we make it so that\nother people can't see it if they're\njust happen to be on our Network then\nthey they won't be able to see the\nsensitive information or if it's in a\ndatabase that is data at rest then it\nwill not be easily seen other things\nwe're going to add are identity and\naccess management capabilities like\nmultiactor authentication so that I\nreally know it's us when you go to log\ninto the system I'm going to use other\nthings like pass keys that make the\nsystem even more secure than a password\nwould and then I'm going to also make\nsure that I have a good backup recovery\nsystem in particular on the protect side\nwe're going to talk about backup the\ndata at some point could be compromised\nI need to make sure that I have a good\nbackup now the cyber security framework\nsays we need a category to deal with\ndetection of threats things where we\ntried to protect but it might have\nfailed so I need a monitoring capability\nand with that monitor I need to be able\nto figure out if I have Adverse Events\nso I need to be able to analyze those\nthings now what kind of tools would I\nneed in place to do that kind of stuff\nwell one thing that would help is an\nendpoint detection and response\ncapability that goes on my individual\nworkstations and tells me if I've got\nmalware or other types of bad behaviors\nuh a network detection response\ncapability that lets me know if\nanomalies are happening at the network\nlayer a thread intelligence feed that\ntells me what kinds of things are\nhappening in the wide environment uh\nmaybe even outside of our own network\nwhat kinds of threat should we be\nlooking for and the attack surface\nmanagement capability that I mentioned\npreviously that's something that I'd\nlike to also take into account because\nthat's where the guys are trying to\nattack well that's a whole bunch of\ntools so what I really want is something\ncalled a security information and event\nmanagement system that actually\ncoordinates and takes information to\nlimit from all of these different\nsystems correlates Aggregates and allows\nme to do that level of\nanalysis we detected an adverse event\nwith our security information event\nmanagement system and now we need to go\nfurther and figure out what we need to\ndo with this we open an incident we have\na system that has cases and we need a\nmanagement system that tracks those so\nthat I can assign a case to an\nindividual person I can gather all the\ninformation that relates to that case\nand pass it off to them the indicators\nof compromise the things that I've\ndiscovered while I was doing my own\nanalysis of this so I'm going to need to\nanalyze this particular case and then\nultimately I need a capability to do\nmitigation so I want to be able to have\nsomething that allows me to know what I\ndo once I have found that this is a\nproblem and I know it's a problem so we\nhave these things called Dynamic\nplaybooks that help us do that Dynamic\nplaybooks lead you through the steps\nthat you need to do to do resolution all\nof these Technologies together we refer\nto as security orchestration Automation\nand response sore for short remember\nthat backup I told you to take over here\nin the protect stage well we're going to\nnow need that because now I want to\nrestore if the outage I just had caused\nme to lose data then I need to be able\nto get that data back but just bringing\nit back may not be enough I also need to\nverify that the data is in fact secure\nthat it hasn't been changed that it\nmaintains Integrity for instance and\nthen depending on the type of outage it\nmight have been there may be some\nCommunications that have to happen I may\nneed to notify certain organizations\nwithin my company I may also have to\nnotify if this was a data breach the\nconsumers who were affected by this so\nlook at what the Regulatory Compliance\naspects of all of these things are that\nyou're responsible for and by the way\nthose would be covered here under the\norganizational context and should also\nbe included in your policies so now you\nsee how you can bring all of these\npieces together as you can see there's a\nlot that goes into building a cyber\nsecurity program and getting it all\nright the good news is the National\nInstitute of Standards created a cyber\nsecurity framework that you can use as\nthe basis for your own security program\nI can't cover all the things to go into\nthat but I've tried to hit some of the\nhighlights here the good news again if\nyou use this then you'll know if you've\nchecked all the boxes and if you haven't\nwell the bad guys are going to let you\nknow and you're really not going to like\nthe way they tell you thanks for\nwatching if you found this video\ninteresting and would like to learn more\nabout cyber security please remember
