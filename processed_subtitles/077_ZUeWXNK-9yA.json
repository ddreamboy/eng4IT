  "text": "when it comes to business communication\ndata visualization is really important\nof course the structure design and\noverall story of your presentation are\nall important too but if you have any\ndata in your presentation at all how you\nvisualize that data can really make or\nbreak the overall effectiveness of your\nmessage\nlet's take this chart as an example it\nshows tree sales over the last few years\nfor a local tree nursery but it's\nunclear what they're really trying to\ntell me compare that instead with the\nsecond chart which shows the exact same\ndata but the message is much more clear\namidst lackluster sales for most tree\nspecies sales of Kwanzan cherry this\ngreen line right here have grown\nsteadily since 2020. this might not seem\nlike much but the difference between\nthese two charts is really important\nthey both show the exact same set of\ndata but in the first chart there's no\nclear message whereas in the second\nchart the message is clear and easy to\nunderstand charts like that first one\nare all over the business World whereas\ncharts like the second one are a little\nbit more rare but the truth is building\na chart like the second one is not that\ndifficult at all all it takes is\nlearning a few core principles really\nwell in this crash course I'm going to\nteach you data visualization skills\nfound at places like MacKenzie Bain and\nBCG you'll learn about choosing the\nright chart type every single time and\nwhy it really matters for your message\nthen I'll teach you my best tips for\nchart design then at the end we'll do a\ncomplete exercise together I'll go\nthrough every step from raw data to\nfinish chart and I'll show you where you\ncan download the same exercise file so\nyou can follow right along with me plus\nas a bonus I'll show you where you can\ndownload this free cheat sheet that's\ngoing to help you choose the right chart\nevery single time I promise you that by\nthe end of this crash course if you\ntruly pay attention and try to apply the\nlearnings you'll be amazed at how much\nmore effectively you can communicate\ndata let's get into it\n[Music]\neveryone Paul here from analyst Academy\nwhere we teach PowerPoint presentation\ndesign and data visualization training\nto consulting firms and finance teams\nand all sorts of other teams all over\nthe world if that sounds like something\nyou're interested in make sure you check\nout our courses over at the\nanalystacademy.com and if you're\nwatching this video you might especially\nbe interested in our data visualization\nfor Consultants course it's kind of like\nthis video but way more detailed with\nHands-On exercises case studies quizzes\nand a whole lot more so make sure you\ncheck that out again that's the analyst\nacademy.com the first and most important\npart of effective data visualization is\nchoosing the right chart type\nto illustrate this let's take a look at\nthe example from the beginning of this\nvideo once again this is showing tree\nsales for a local Nursery so you've got\nyour four different tree types here and\nit's broken out into different clusters\nbased on year\nthis is what's called a clustered column\nchart the takeaway for a chart like this\nmight be something like Kwanzan cherry\nbecame the best-selling species in 2023\nwhich you can clearly see right here\nyou're comparing each of these different\nspecies against each other and in 2023\nis when it first became the number one\nselling tree\nbut then what if you put the data in a\nstacked column chart like this now the\nemphasis seems to be on the total of\neach of these columns you're combining\nall the species together so the focus\ngets put right here on the overall total\nso a message for a chart like this might\nbe something like overall tree cells\nhave risen steadily since 2020 driven by\nKwanzan cherry growth again the focus is\non the overall trend but you can still\nsort of see the different changes from\nyear to year now put this data in a line\nchart and the message changes entirely\nhere you can kind of see this Kwanzan\ncherry data\nincreasing over time so a message might\nbe something like emits lackluster sales\nfor most tree species sales of Kwanzan\ncherry have grown steadily since 2020.\nyou can kind of see these other trees\nthey're flat to declining but this one\nis growing again this is all the same\ndata for each one of these charts but\nthe message is changing ever so subtly\nso in the first part of this crash\ncourse I'm going to cover the five major\nchart types starting with the most\nreliable one the bar chart the primary\npurpose of a bar chart is to compare\ncategories against each other\nand this makes sense you can easily\ncompare the lengths of each of these\nlines\nit's really easy to see which one is\nlongest second longest and so on it easy\nto read it's precise and it's incredibly\nreliable\nlet's take a look at this example from\nMcKinsey title says top CEOs identify\ndisruptive technology the economy and\ngeopolitics as the most important Trends\nto act on in 2023 so what this is\nshowing is survey results about the\ntrends leading into 2023 and with a bar\nchart it's really easy to see which one\nof these is longest second longest and\nso on so what they've done is they've\nhighlighted these top three bars right\nhere\nthese are the most important it's clear\nit's interesting and it communicates the\nmessage really effectively and that's\nwhat a bar chart is meant for again you\nwant to compare different categories\nagainst each other in this case these\ndifferent trends that way you can easily\nsee which one is the highest or has the\nbiggest value or what have you and of\ncourse there's a few different\nvariations to the bar chart there's a\nclustered bar chart which kind of\nfocuses on these subcategories right\nhere you can compare this green dark\ngray light gray against each other\nthere's the Stacked bar chart which\nfocuses on the overall size of these\ndifferent subcategories put together\nwhile still being able to show the\nrelative differences of each of the\nsubcategories then there's the 100 stack\nbar chart where all the bars are the\nsame length but the subcategories differ\nfrom category to category so you can see\nkind of the relative changes\nwhen you're trying to decide between\nthese different variations the question\nyou should be asking yourself is what's\neasiest to compare with a clustered bar\nchart it's really easy to compare the\ndifferent subcategories against each\nother versus a stacked bar chart it's\neasy to compare the overall totals of\nall the subcategories put together but\nthe most important thing to remember\nwith the bar chart is that it's easy for\ncomparing categories against each other\nthe next chart on our list is a column\nchart and this one's really similar to a\nbar chart and that it's easy to compare\nthese different categories against each\nother but there are a few reasons why\nyou'd want to use a column chart over a\nbar chart and vice versa the primary\nreason is that column charts are good\nfor change over time that's because our\nbrains naturally read these charts from\nleft to right\ntake a look at this example from Charter\nit shows the changes in Harvard's\nendowment fund by year starting from 99\nall the way up through 2022. in the\nnatural tendency with this kind of chart\nis to read it from left to right\nso a column chart makes sense whereas a\nbar chart might be a little bit more\ndifficult if it was from top to bottom\nnotice how with this chart though the\nfocus is still on the individual columns\nand comparing them against each other\nthis says four percent decrease from\n2021 it's comparing the total for 2021\nto 2022 emphasize with this Arrow right\nhere so for this message a column chart\nis a really good choice\nwell the column chart you have the same\nvariations that you have with a bar\nchart you've got the clustered column\nchart\nstacked column chart and of course the\n100 stacked column chart and again the\nquestion you want to ask yourself is\nwhat's easiest to compare with each of\nthese charts are you comparing\nsubcategories the category totals or\nmaybe the subtle changes in categories\nover time the next chart I'm going to\ncover is a pie chart and this is by far\nthe most controversial chart in the data\nvisualization world and there's good\nreason for that but the truth is the pie\nchart does have its place when it's used\ncorrectly unlike a bar or column chart\nyou don't want to use a pie chart to\ncompare categories against each other\nthe primary purpose of a pie chart is to\ncompare a value against the total or\ncompare multiple values against the\ntotal so in Practical terms what this\nmeans is you're taking one slice and\ncomparing it to the total of the entire\npi and the shape of the pie chart really\nlends to this because our brains kind of\nnaturally associate circles with 100 so\nit's not that hard for our brains to\ntake a slice of this and guess roughly\nwhat the percentage of it is so maybe\nthis is 55 for example where people\nmostly go wrong is when they try to\ncompare the size of these different\nslices against each other this one\nversus this one versus this one because\nthat's pretty hard to do\nyou'd be much better off\nwith a bar chart\nlet's take a look at this McKinsey\nexample\nthe title says 63 percent of consumers\npay for at least one loyalty program and\nhere you have a donut chart which is\nbasically like a pie chart but with this\nkind of Center taken out and what it's\nsaying is 63 of consumers\npay for at least one of these three\nloyalty programs or I guess Amazon Prime\nAmazon Prime and others or just other\nprograms and what it's trying to\nemphasize with this title\nthis section right here\nin other words it's saying 63 of people\neither have Amazon Prime only Amazon\nPrime and other loyalty programs or just\nother loyalty programs and this would be\na little bit more difficult to show in a\nbar or a column chart or any other chart\nfor that matter so in this specific case\na pie chart or a donut chart works\nreally well but if the message were\nslightly different let's say the\npercentage of non-subscribers is greater\nthan the percentage of subscribers then\nthis message wouldn't come through quite\nas clearly instead you'd be better off\nwith\na bar chart the reason for that is it's\nreally easy to compare the lengths of\nthese different bars so this would be\nnon-subscribers\nand this would be\nsubscribers\njust like with the other chart there are\nsome variations to this chart one we\njust saw which is a donut chart which is\nessentially the same as a pie chart but\nwith no hole so you can put extra data\nin there the only downside to a donut\nchart is it's harder to see the internal\nangles which for some people can make\nthings just a little bit difficult but\nfor the most part they're very commonly\nused and a good chart choice\nthere are some other variations like a\nSunburst chart or a tree map which\nfollow the same idea as a pie chart but\nlook just a little bit differently\nthe next chart on our list is a line\nchart and this is good for showing\nchanges or Trends or patterns over time\nit's very similar to a column chart but\nthe difference is instead of focusing on\neach individual column all the points\nare connected together so you kind of\nfocus on the data as a whole\nthis helps emphasize things like\ndownward Trends or spikes upward Trends\nanomalies in the data things like that\nso for example here we have a chart\nabout the growth in the number of\ndiversity equity and inclusion roles\nsince 2015. and if you take a look at\nthe message here it's talking about a\nmeteoric rise so a line chart is good\nfor this because a it's expressed over\ntime but then B it's showing this like\nstrong upward Trend yes you could still\nsee that data in a column chart but it\ngets emphasized just a little bit more\nin a line chart because you have these\nsloping lines\nthe caution with line charts is you want\nto make sure that you're using them for\ndata that has a natural order to it so\nfor example time has a natural order but\nlet's say you had different categories\nif there's no natural order to this data\nyou can put it in any order you want\nand you could be showing a trend that\ndoesn't necessarily exist so be careful\nto use this for data that's expressed\nover time or in some other natural order\nthere's a few different common\nvariations to a line chart one of them\nof course is to just put multiple lines\non the chart this is good for a few\ndifferent things\none thing is emphasizing how one of the\nlines is different than the other but\nsometimes you could also have a chart\nwhere you're trying to show that all the\nlines kind of follow the same pattern\nanother variation to the line chart is\nan area chart now we go into a lot more\ndetail on this chart in the course but\nbasically you can think of it as a\ncolumn chart combined\nwith a line chart\nwhereas a column chart kind of focuses\non these as values and a line chart\nfocuses on the overall trend an area\nchart does a little bit of both then of\ncourse you have a stacked area chart\nand a 100 stacked error chart which\nagain serve much of the same function as\na 100 stacked column chart where it\nfocuses on how these how the makeup of\nthese different categories changes over\ntime\nthe next chart on our list is a scatter\nplot and this is one of my favorite\ncharts the primary purpose of a scatter\nplot is to show the relationship between\ntwo variables so imagine for example\nif this represented weight in this\nrepresented height\ngenerally speaking\nthe taller someone gets\nthe more they tend to weigh\nand this is represented mathematically\nwith the coefficient of determination or\nr squared so with the scatter plot you\ncould be showing a few different things\nyou could be showing positive\ncorrelation you could be showing\nnegative correlation or you could be\nshowing no correlation at all which in\nitself can be telling sometimes it's\nalso good for highlighting outliers so\nfor example if you had a DOT way over\nhere that you wanted to emphasize or\nit's good for just showing where a\nspecific dot falls on this plot here's a\npretty good example from BCG what it's\nshowing is price volatility\nversus this VRE or penetration of\nvariable Renewables\nand what it's trying to communicate with\nthis chart actually is that they don't\nbelieve there's much of a correlation at\nall\nwhich like I said in itself can be\ntelling\nthe other powerful thing about Scatter\nPlots is you can add additional\nvariables to make the information a\nlittle bit more Rich so for example if\nyou wanted to change the size of each of\nthe dots if you wanted them to represent\nsomething else then voila you have a\nbubble chart and again you have that\nmuch more information to communicate to\nthe audience you can also change the\ncolor of the dots or you can even change\nthe symbols themselves however I would\nreally caution against this unless you\nabsolutely have to the Temptation with\nScatter Plots is to introduce all these\nextra variables it just makes it more\nconfusing for your audience focus on\nyour main message and make sure that\ncomes through clearly in your chart so\nwhen it comes to effective data\nvisualization ninety percent of the time\nyou're going to be able to use one of\nthe five charts we just went over bar\nchart column chart pie chart line chart\nand scatter plot in a recent video I\nremade fancy charts into realistic\nslides and in every single case I used\none of these charts and in other videos\nI follow the same pattern so the key to\ngood data visualization is learning when\nto use these charts and learning it\nreally really well the best way to do\nthat of course is with practice and\nrepetition but I promise you if you can\nfocus on this core set of skills you'll\nget really really good at data\nvisualization once again if you're\ninterested in this sort of topic make\nsure you check out our course over at\nthe analystacademy.com we go in much\ngreater detail and really explain the\nnuances of each of the different chart\ntypes and it's complete with examples\nexercises quizzes that sort of thing so\nmake sure you check it out in addition\nto these core chart types there are\nadditional ways to visualize your data\nand we don't have time to get into all\nof them now but one in particular that I\nwant to talk about is tables tables can\nbe especially good for two reasons the\nfirst is when you need to show precise\nvalues so for example here we have a\nbasic table that shows sales for\ndifferent regions and a few additional\nmetrics like share growth and the number\nof full-time employees in a table would\nbe really good here if I wanted to show\nspecific values like the negative growth\nvalues for example for example if my\nmessage was in the east region we saw\nnegative one percent growth year over\nyear then this would be a good choice\nbecause I'm calling out a specific data\npoint the other major reason is if\nyou're trying to show multiple types of\ndata in the same space here we're not\njust showing sales but we're also\nshowing the share growth and number\nfull-time employees and that would be\npretty difficult to display in a chart\nis it possible yes but it would just\nmake things a little bit more confusing\nthere's a good example of this by BCG so\nhere's a chart from a presentation about\nthe New York media sector and what it's\nprimarily showing is the percentage of\nNew York Jobs versus total jobs in each\nof these different years\nso for example in advertising 12 of the\njobs were in New York versus the rest of\nthe US and then in 2011 that jumped to\n13 percent\nso if these individual values themselves\nare important then a table is a good\nchoice here\nbut the primary reason to use a table\nhere is because you're also showing\nthese extra information for example\nthe growth in New York City jobs\nthese are both percentages but they're\nshowing fundamentally different data\nplus you have these numbers down here\nwhere you're showing absolute values\nthese are salary numbers\ntrying to put all this information in a\nchart would be difficult and confusing\nso here the table is a good choice all\nright now that we've talked about the\ndifferent ways to visualize your data\nlet's talk about design best practices\nnow there's a lot of different things I\ncould talk about here but I'm going to\nboil it down into two key ideas\nthe first is to make sure your message\nis clear\nnow this sounds like a pretty basic\nthing but you'll be surprised how many\npeople really mess this up\nyou have an overall message that you\nwant to communicate make sure that\nmessage comes through very clearly in\nthe chart itself and there's a few\ndifferent ways you can do that let's\nrevisit this chart from McKinsey\nremember it's just a simple bar chart\ncomparing these different Trends against\neach other but they do a few different\nthings to call attention to the message\nof the chart which is that these three\nTrends disruptive technology economy and\ngeopolitics are going to be the most\nimportant Trends to act on in 2023. the\nfirst thing is they have a clear title\nand this is the easiest and most\nimportant thing you can do for effective\ncommunication have a clear title that\nexplicitly communicates the message\nyou're trying to tell the audience\nthe other thing they've done is they've\nhighlighted the bars themselves drawing\nattention to them as the most important\nTrends and of course they've ranked\nthese Trends in order to make it that\nmuch easier these are subtle things but\nthey have a huge impact in the overall\nClarity of your message\nfigure out what your message is and find\na way to communicate that clearly there\nare a few other things they could have\ndone they could have put a box around\nThese Bars maybe an arrow some\nadditional text right here all of these\nare ways you can draw attention to your\nmessage which again is really important\nanother really important principle of\ngood chart design is removing the\nClutter from your chart you'd be\nsurprised how many things you can take\naway from your chart that really don't\nmatter to the overall message or to the\ndata itself here's an example from The\nEconomist that highlights this really\nwell the title itself is really simple\nthe subtitle and explanation also very\nsimple and clear but notice how there's\nnot even any axes on this chart there's\nno data labels right here to clutter the\nmessage all it is\nare the categories\nlabels in the bars themselves and notice\nalso that they only use one color for\nthis chart\nall those things are a deliberate effort\nto help you focus on the actual data and\nnot on anything else we actually did a\nwhole video on The Economist and why\ntheir charts are so effective so if\nyou're interested in stuff like that\nI'll include a link down in the\ndescription\nso really good chart design comes down\nto two things emphasize your message in\nthe chart and remove the Clutter frame\nchart and if you can do those two things\nand do them really well your charts are\ngoing to look a whole lot better\nall right now that we've covered the\nbasics let's walk through an exercise\ntogether\nall right so we're going to keep this\nreally simple here's the data actually\nfrom the table example earlier and all\nit shows is\nsales by region the share of sales for\neach region year over year growth and\nsales FTE if you want to follow along\nwith this exercise yourself I'll include\na download link in the description below\nor instead of following along you can do\nthe exercise yourself first and then\ncome back and see the solution here on\nthe video\nso let's say your manager says Hey I\nwant you to help me understand the\nrelationship between overall sales for\neach region and sales FTE all right so\nwe have our data here we just need to\nfigure out which chart type is going to\nbe best for emphasizing that message\ngoing through each of the different\nchart types first you have a bar chart a\nbar chart would be good for comparing\nthese different categories against each\nother but that's not necessarily what\nwe're doing for example we're not trying\nto say that sales in the north is\ngreater than sales in the Southeast or\nthat East Central or excuse me South\nCentral has greater sales than all of\nthem a bar chart would be great for that\nbut that's not what we're doing and\nlikewise a column chart we're not\ncomparing these against each other and\nwe're not doing it over time so column\nchart doesn't really work either\nsame thing with the line chart we're not\nreally trying to show the trend of any\nparticular set of data we're trying to\nshow the relationship between these two\nsets of data so line chart is out also a\npie chart would be good for example if\nwe were trying to say that East and East\nCentral account for a certain percentage\nof the overall sales but that's not what\nwe're trying to show again we're trying\nto show the relationship between these\ntwo variables so as you might have\nguessed the scatter plot is going to be\na good choice here all right so let's\nput this data into a scatter plot and\nsee what it shows us by the way for this\nexercise I'm going to use a tool called\namplar charts it's the chart building\ntool that we use and recommend over at\nanalyst Academy it's really robust lots\nof excellent functionality and it makes\nchart building really really simple and\neasy it's built right into PowerPoint\nhere you just select the chart that you\nwant you can customize it really simple\nand easily which you're going to see\nhere in a second but again it's\nsomething we recommend you can get a\nfree one month trial by following the\nlink in the description all right so\nwe're going to build a scatter plot so\nwe'll just go up here go down to scatter\nyou can just choose the size we'll just\nkeep it simple like this\nand then just we just need to copy our\ndata into the chart oops\njust copy this just double click on the\nchart\nbrings up this Excel like window here\nit'll come back over to this one\nand copy sales Ft\nplace that in here these two columns are\nfor if you wanted to separate these into\ndifferent groups so for example if you\nwanted\num you know Northwest East East Central\nNorth all to be in a certain group and a\ncertain color and if you wanted the rest\nof it to be a different color that's\nwhat you would use this column for and\nthen this would be if you wanted to\ninclude an additional variable turn it\ninto a bubble chart but we're not going\nto do either of those things because\nwe're going to keep it simple\ndelete those columns and here we go we\nalready have the data that we're looking\nfor\nand you can see that there's a general\nsort of positive correlation here so\nwhen you're trying to build an effective\nchart remember there's two things you\nwant to focus on making sure your\nmessage comes through clearly and\nremoving the Clutter from your chart so\nlet's start with the message\nso the first thing we're going to do is\njust add a simple Title Here\nthat's going to give us our biggest\nbang for the buck in terms of effort\nlet's move this chart down a little bit\nall right so let's just put a simple\ntitle in here\nmore sales\nFTE\n10 to lead to\nhigher sales for each region\nprobably a better title out there but\nwe'll just stick with this one it's\npretty simple but really the main focus\nof this is to emphasize the message in\nthe chart\nanother thing we could do here\nis we can add a trend line this is going\nto help emphasize that this is a\npositively correlated relationship\nbetween these two variables\nall right just to make sure we're\nbeing comprehensive\nlet's include a little subtitle here\nsay\nsales FTE\nversus total sales\nUSD\nthe year here just to be comprehensive\na little smaller italicize\nthere we go\nso now we have the basics of our chart\nin place it's really just about removing\nclutter and the good thing is with a\nchart like this it's kind of already\ndecluttered so\nwe can't really remove the axes here I\nthink that would take away from the\neffectiveness of this chart it being a\nscatter plot\nwe could probably remove the labels but\nthey don't clutter the chart too much so\nI think it's okay but one thing I do\nwant to do\nis actually\nchange the color of the labels to\nsomething a little less\nstandoutish\nso the focus gets put on put on the dots\nthemselves\nand changing the color of these is\nreally simple and easy\nand actually I'm also going to\nincrease the size of these just a little\nbit more there we go and with that we\nhave a pretty solid chart there's not a\nwhole lot of stuff here but it is a nice\nlooking chart that clearly communicates\nthe message without too much distraction\nwhich is exactly what we want\nif there's one thing I want you to take\naway from this course it's this\neffective data visualization is not\nabout learning every fancy chart type\nyes those things have their place but\nfor most people the key to good data\nvisualization is learning the basics\nreally really well in applying them\nbefore we go I did promise you a free\ncheat sheet and this is going to help\nyou choose the right chart it summarizes\na lot of the stuff that we covered today\nso could be a good handy resource for\nyou you can get that by going to the\nanalystacademy.com charts\nthanks again for watching today's video\nlet me know down in the comments if you\nhave any questions about the content we\ncovered or if there's something
