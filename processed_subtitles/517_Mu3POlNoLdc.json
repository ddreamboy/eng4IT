  "text": "welcome back to another machine learning\nexplained video by assembly ai in this\nvideo we talk about supervised learning\nwhich is arguably the most important\ntype of machine learning you will learn\nwhat it means examples of supervised\nlearning or this data and training types\nof supervised learning and we touch on\nspecific algorithms of supervised\nlearning let's begin with the very\nbasics what does machine learning mean\nmachine learning is a sub-area of\nartificial intelligence and it's the\nstudy of algorithms that give computers\nthe ability to learn and make decisions\nbased on data and not from explicit\ninstructions a popular example is\nlearning to predict whether an email is\nspam or no spam by reading many\ndifferent emails of these two types we\ntypically differentiate between three\ntypes of machine learning supervised\nlearning unsupervised learning and\nreinforcement learning in supervised\nlearning the computer learns by making\nuse of labeled data so we know the\ncorresponding label or target of our\ndata an example is again the spam\nprediction algorithm where we show many\ndifferent emails to the computer and for\neach email we know if this was a spam\nemail or not on the other hand in\nunsupervised learning the computer\nlearns by making use of unlabeled data\nso we have data but we don't know the\ncorresponding target an example is to\ncluster books into different categories\non the basis of the title and other book\ninformation but not by knowing its\nactual category and then there is also\nreinforcement learning where so-called\nintelligent software agents take actions\nin an environment and automatically try\nto improve its behavior this usually\nworks with a system of rewards and\npunishments and popular examples are\ngames for example a computer can learn\nto be good in the snake game only by\nplaying the game itself and every time\nit eats an apple or it dies it learns\nfrom this actions now in this video we\nare going to focus on supervised\nlearning where we learn from labeled\ndata now what is data\ndata can be any relevant information we\ncollect for our algorithm this can be\nfor example user information like age\nand gender or text data or images or\ninformation within an image like\nmeasurements or color information the\npossibilities are endless here let's\nlook at a concrete example in the\npopular iris flower data set we want to\npredict the type of iris flower based on\ndifferent measurements we have 150\nrecords of flowers with different\nattributes that have been measured\nbefore so for each flower we have the\nsepal length saypal width petal length\nand petal width these are called the\nfeatures and we also have the\ncorresponding species this is called the\nclass the label or the target so this is\na supervised case where we know the\nlabel we can represent this table in a\nmathematical way so we put each feature\ninto a vector this is the feature vector\nand then we do this for all the\ndifferent samples and when we do this\nfor all the different samples we end up\nin a 2d representation which is also\ncalled a matrix additionally we can put\nall labels into one vector this is\ncalled the target vector now in\nsupervised learning we take the features\nand the labels and show it to the\ncomputer so that it learns\nwe call this the training step and the\ndata we use is called the training data\ntraining is performed by specific\nalgorithms that usually try to minimize\nan error during this training process\nand this is done by mathematical\noptimization methods which i won't go\ninto more detail here after training we\nwant to show new data to the computer\nthat it has never seen before and where\nwe don't know the label this is called\nour test data and now the trained\ncomputer should be able to make a\ndecision based on the information it has\nseen and determine the correct target\nvalue\nand this is how supervised learning\nworks there are two types of supervised\nlearning classification and regression\nin classification we predict a discrete\nclass label in the previous flower\nclassification example our target values\ncan only have the values 0 1 and 2\ncorresponding to the three different\nclasses if we have more than two\npossible labels like here we call this a\nmulti-class classification problem if we\nonly have two labels usually zero and\none is used then we call this a binary\nclassification problem for example spam\nor no spam on the other hand in\nregression we try to predict a\ncontinuous target value meaning the\ntarget value can have a more or less\narbitrary value one example is to\npredict house prices based on given\ninformation about the house and the\nneighborhood\nthe target variable which is the price\ncan basically have any value here now\nthat we know what supervised learning\nmeans let's have a look at concrete\nalgorithms i will not explain them in\ndetail here i simply name them so that\nyou have heard of them they all have a\nunique design and can be different in\nthe way how it stores the information\nmathematically how it solves the\ntraining process through mathematical\noperations and how it transforms the\ndata this list is not exhaustive but\nhere are 10 algorithms that are nice to\nknow some of them can be used for either\nregression or classification and some\ncan even be used for both cases popular\nalgorithms are linear regression\nlogistic regression decision trees\nrandom forest naive bayes perceptron and\nmulti-layer perceptron support vector\nmachines or short svm k-nearest\nneighbors or short knn adaboost and\nneural networks which are part of the\ndeep learning field\nalright i hope you enjoyed
