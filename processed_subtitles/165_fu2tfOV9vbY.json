  "text": "hey everyone my name is rob and today\nwe're going to be using python to do\nsome object detection using yolo v5 if\nyou've never heard of yolo before it\nstands for you only look once and it's\nan open source package for doing object\ndetection it comes with pre-trained\nmodels so it can do some object\ndetection just out of the box you can\nalso fine-tune it on your own data set\nif you want to do custom object\ndetection i first came across yolo v5\nwhen working on some kaggle competitions\nwith object detection and it really\ncurrently is the state of the art there\nis a lot built into it that makes object\ndetection just easy to do so we're going\nto walk through that and see how it goes\ntoday okay so here i am on the yolo v5\ngithub repository you can see that it's\na pretty active repository and they do\nhave description here of what it is\nand have some official documentation to\nget started with it the first thing we\nactually need to do is clone this repo\nnow i'm working on my desktop machine\nwhich is a linux machine\nrunning ubuntu 2004 and i also have\ntwo gpus in this machine that\nthe yolo v5 will use to predict\nit also uses\npi torch as the back end where all the\nmodels were trained and we will actually\nset up a new environment here that will\nrun yolo v5 and have all the correct\npackages installed so i'm switching over\nhere to my handy terminal and i'm in my\ndirectory where i like to clone my\nrepositories and all i'm going to do is\nrun this\ngit clone here\nnow it's recommended too that you have\nanaconda installed right now i i have\nanaconda installed on this machine and\nthat'll let me create a brand new conda\nenvironment\nfor yolo v5 so what it uh says to do\nnext is just a cd into this directory\nwhere\ni cloned and if i do lctr we could see\nthese are all the\nfiles from this github repository that\nwe have cloned\nand then i'm actually gonna uh conda\ncreate\nuh with the name yolo v5 so i'm going to\ncreate a fresh new conda environment\nwhere we can\ninstall all the required packages so i\njust do that by doing connor create dash\nname i named it yolo v5 and i do need\ntwo dashes here in the name and i'll\ntype yes\nto install all these dependencies okay\nso in order to activate this conda\nenvironment i just do conda activate\nyolo v5\nactivated in this environment and you\ncan see because it says yolo v5 i also\nins made sure i installed python 3.8\nbecause the docs for yolo v5 do say it\nneeds at least three\nseven it looks like\nso now that i'm in here i can just pip\ninstall all the requirements that are in\nthis requirements text if you want to\njust look in the requirements text these\nare all the\npackages that it will install and it'll\nmake sure i install\nall the right versions\nso this might take a little while\nbecause it's going to have to download\nsome of the wheels if it's your first\ntime\ninstalling these packages\nand it needs to run through and install\nthem all\nokay so it looks like it's done\ninstalling them all so i'll just clear\nthis screen if you look over in the repo\nin this detect dot pi\nwe could see that it actually\ncan be called just from python\nwith some arguments so\nby default it will\npick certain weights to use so\nyolo v5 comes in different sizes let's\nlook and see what sizes of the weights\nthat we have as options yeah so they're\nshown here yolo v5 the smallest is n and\nthe largest is x and it looks like\nthere's even a new one efficient debt\nversion of it\nand what else are we gonna get it we're\ngonna need to provide it the source now\ni wanna provide it this\nmy webcam to see if it will run directly\non my webcam and we just provide\nthe number where the webcam is\nassociated so if you only have one\nwebcam you'll be putting in zero here\nand we'll see how that that works and\nwe're not actually providing any data\nto train on so we don't have to worry\nabout this\nthat's all we really need i think\nokay so i think i have it working here\nthe command that i needed to run was\njust python detect and then i'm using\nsource five which is my second webcam\nand i have a green screen here behind me\nso it's going to show the green screen\nwhen it loads up let's try running this\ndetect and see how it works\nwe can see that it is using\nthe small version of uh\nyolo weights but there we are so you can\nsee me there's a person here's my oh it\nthinks my fingers are carrots\nthumbs up uh let's hold up let's take\noff my glasses is it no glasses tennis\nracket all right not perfect not perfect\num\nphone\ncell phone it's good at that\nuh maybe\na cup\ncup okay yeah that's pretty good\nand you can see the confidences are\nshown\non the side of the image so it's drawing\nthe bonding box and showing the side but\nif you wanted to pull out just the the\nbounding boxes you could do that as well\nor store any information from yellow b5\nby going into the source code\ncool so we're going to kill that and\nlet's try to load the larger weights\nbecause the larger weights are going to\nmean that it performs more accurate and\nit's might be a little bit slower but\nit's going to perform better so\nwhat we need to do to get the larger\nweights is run python detect and then\nfeed in the yolo v5x weights and then\ngive it the same source\nnow you can see it's actually\ndownloading these weights\nfusing the layers\nall right and now we're back to my\nobject detecting you can see the chair\nit sees the corner of the chair it knows\nthis is a comp a lot better\ndoes it think my fingers are still no\nit's pretty good about my fingers maybe\nif i just hold my hand no it thinks i'm\na person cell phone\nthis is just working on the default\npre-trained weights but if you wanted to\ndoes it know this is a microphone but\nyou can make it more customizable by\nfine-tuning the training on a different\ndata set that's pre-labeled\nthere we go look that's pretty good it's\npretty confident of all the things\nnow let's try to run it on video data\nset so i do have this data set which is\na video\nfootage of a bunch of different cars\ndriving around and i'm used this for a\ndifferent youtube video that i created\non working with\nvideo data but let's try to run\nthis object detection on this video and\nsee how it works we're going to call\nthis again but instead of giving it a\nsource we're going to give it the\ndesktop\nmp4 file\nokay so it looks like it's running\nand it's detecting people bicycles cars\nso what it's doing here is it's running\nnow on this data set\nit has\nthe number of frames that it's gone\nthrough of the entire video\nand the number of people that it sees\ncars these are just some of the labels\ncoming out here printed to our command\nline\nso it looks like you can provide a view\nimage\nlike this\nin order to actually view the images as\nits processing\nyeah there we go it's a little bit\nslower\nbut it is working we see that it's\ndetecting all these different cars and\nobjects even detecting the traffic light\nwhich is really impressive\nso if i kill this now\ni can um change other\nsettings like the confidence threshold\nand the iou threshold so if we only want\nit to show objects that it's very\nconfident of it's defaulted to 0.25 but\nlet's change that confidence threshold\nto 0.9\nand run that\nthere now it's detecting much less\nbecause the threshold that it needs to\ndetect in order to show needs to be at\nleast 0.9\nlet's do 0.5\nokay that looks pretty good\nand then there's also something called\nan iou threshold and this basically\nmeans\nuh it's it will suppress\nany\nobjects that it detects that overlap\neach other so iou has to do with the\noverlapping of two detected objects\nlet's do 0.9 for the iou threshold\nis\n0.5 so what's happening here is when we\nset the iou confidence to be really low\nit won't allow any boxes to be\noverlapping each other very much it'll\njust suppress any object detection that\noverlaps with another object detection\nso by turning this off and setting it\nreally high will allow for a lot of\noverlapping boxes and let's do one last\nrun with a really low confidence\nthreshold and a high iou threshold\nthere we go so this is a lot of\ndifferent boxes and\neven this car that it's detecting in the\nlower right side\nis very low confidence but it's\ndisplaying it because we've set that\nconfidence threshold so low\nthanks for watching this video it's a\nshort introduction to using yolo v5 both\non a webcam and processing videos for\nobject detection if you enjoyed this\nvideo please give it a like and\nsubscribe and i'll see you in the next\nvideo\n",
