  "text": "data warehousing is one of the hottest\ntopics both in business and in data\nscience but if you're new to the field\nyou're probably wondering what a data\nwarehouse is why we need it and how it\nworks\ndon't worry because in four minutes\nyou'll know the answers to all these\nquestions alright first let's start with\nthe definition what is the meaning of\nthe phrase single source of truth in\nInformation Systems Theory the single\nsource of truth is the practice of\nstructuring all the best quality data in\none place let's look at a very simple\nexample surely it has happened to you to\nwork on a file and to create many\ndifferent versions of it how do you name\nsuch a file well once you are done you\noften place the word final at the end\nthis results in having a bunch of files\nwith extensions final final final final\nfinal final or my favorite really final\nfinal if this is you you are not alone\nit seems that even corporations never\nknow where the most recent or most\nappropriate file is but what if you knew\nthat there is one single place where you\nwould always have the single source of\ninformation that would be quite helpful\nwouldn't it well a data warehouse exists\nto fill that need so what is a data\nwarehouse exactly it is the place where\ncompanies store their valuable data\nassets including customer data sales\ndata employee data and so on in short a\ndata warehouse is the de-facto single\nsource of data truth for an organization\nit is usually created and used primarily\nfor data reporting and analysis purposes\nthere are several defining features of a\ndata warehouse it is subject oriented\nintegrated time variant non-volatile\nsummarized let's quickly go through\nthese one-by-one\nsubject oriented means that the\ninformation in the data warehouse\nrevolves around some subject therefore\nit does not contain all company data\never but only the subject matters of\ninterest for instance data on your\ncompetitors need not appear in a data\nwarehouse however your own sales data\nwill most certainly be there\nintegrated corresponds to the example\nfrom the beginning of the video each\ndatabase or each team or even each\nperson has their own preferences when it\ncomes to naming conventions that is why\ncommon standards are developed to make\nsure that the data warehouse picks the\nbest quality data from everywhere this\nrelates to master data governance but\nthat is a topic for another time time\nvariant relates to the fact that a data\nwarehouse contains historical data too\nas said before we mainly use a data\nwarehouse for analysis and reporting\nwhich implies we need to know what\nhappened five or ten years ago\nnon-volatile implies that the data only\nflows in the data warehouse as is once\nthere it cannot be changed or deleted\nsummarized once again touches upon the\nfact that the data is used for data\nanalytics often it is aggregated or\nsegmented in some ways in order to\nfacilitate analysis and reporting all\nright so that's what a data warehouse is\na very well structured and non-volatile\nde facto single source of truth for a\ncompany if you enjoyed this video don't\nforget to hit the like button and share\nit with your friends and if you'd like\nto become an expert in all things data\nscience subscribe to our Channel\nthanks for watching and good luck\n",
