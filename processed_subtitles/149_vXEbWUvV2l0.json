  "text": "everyone and um happy weekend so I hope\nit's a good start of your weekend and um\nfirst of all kudos to you guys that\nyou're using this weekend morning um\nafternoon for some it might be morning\nas well so uh you're using it to up\nskill and to know how you can advance in\nyour career so uh from the chat um\nI'm trying to get to know the audience\nand um\nI see that a few of them are saying that\num abishek is saying that they are new\nto data analytics and uh there Sophia\nwho is from MSE information technology\nand she's currently doing internship and\ndata analytics so um resume not getting\nshortlisted is one problem yes because\nuh there can be multiple things out\nthere uh one that you might be applying\nto a job where uh there are a lot of\npeople who are applying to it and the\nselection is already done\nor recently I was reading in the news\nthat people are also saying that if\nyou're over qualified then also you\nmight not really get into that was just\noneof situation but generally you get\nthe interview calls um so today's\nsession we are going to see that how you\ncan crack an interview in Microsoft of a\ndata analyst so before that I would like\nto introduce myself um I have been\nworking with Microsoft from past um like\nfrom the start of my career and I was\none among the top 10 uh data analyst in\nMicrosoft India where uh uh we were just\nstarting the data analyst team in\nMicrosoft so it was pretty new uh job\nprofile for Microsoft team as well uh\nall that while it was Data analysis was\ndone through the third parties and not\nreally from at the like from the fds\nlevel the full-time level so uh it was a\ngreat venture to know exactly how uh the\nthe pilot version of data analytics team\nhas formed and we have come so far now\nuh and we see that nowadays like data\nanalysis is really uh something that\neverybody talks about and it's needed so\nin my career I have worked B about 25 to\n32 it was uh not only just being but\nthere are many other products that I\nhave worked in Microsoft so uh it was a\ngreat experience as I had got an um\nchance to work on diverse data sets and\nuh there were different challenges in uh\ndifferent uh products so uh there were\nproducts from B there were products from\ncotana copilot recent one was copilot\nthere something you you guys have heard\nof uh Viva topics uh that is something\nthat we have been working on and uh\nevery now and then there are different\ntools that we get to uh work with as a\nMicrosoft data analytics in during my\ncareer I've also got a chance to uh be a\nsite lead for the semantic machines team\nwhich was becoming uh like Cortana was\nbecoming semantic so before the copilot\nstory uh the Cortana existed and we were\ntrying to um like uh reform quana into a\nversion who would understand semantic\num I think that's about my my\ncareer uh for now and we will quickly\ndelve into the topic for today like how\nwe want to actually track the interview\nof data analytics at Microsoft um so for\nthat um a couple\nmore okay is if my voice is breaking\nagain then let me know uh I hope it is\nbetter now\n so uh there are few questions that's\ncoming in so do pour in your questions\nfor me for coding ninjas and uh also\ncoding ninjas is working with no.com so\nin case you have any questions for um\nall of them and regarding job boot camp\nuh since coding Ninja's job boot camp is\nalso sponsor in the session so if you\nhave any questions regarding all of\nthese things do pour in in Q&A we will\nanswer it at the end of the session and\nin between also we will try to address\nfew uh questions if there are any okay\n so I'll start with sharing my screen\nthat I have prepared I have charted down\nall the possible um tips and tricks that\nworked for me for my uh from my mentors\nfor my mentees I have prepared if there\nare uh some things that they wanted to\nlearn from it and uh these are few\nthings that I have learned from my team\nmembers from my managers uh what worked\nwell and what did not work well so uh\none thing I would want to uh share is\nthat\nuh this is just the best practices and\nit is not a short short method to crack\nthe uh interview at data like as a data\nanalyst in Microsoft uh because every\nteam might have their own uh set of uh\nrequirements or problem to solve So\nbased on that they would put different\ntype of rounds and different type of\nproblems challenges that you have to\nsolve uh using these\nuh in this job right so based on that\nyou will have different rounds or\ndifferent way that they would check your\nskills okay so depends on managers\ndepends on team as well like um if they\ncan be a team of 30 members they are\ntrying to fit you in and you need to\nknow how to work with those people there\ncan be remote settings there can be\npeople who are working with clients\noffshore so all of these things\nsituations would occur and based on that\ndifferent situations will be there and\nuh there'll be different way of gauging\num a candidate and this is something\nthat worked for me and few of the people\nthat I know in my network so that's what\nI'm sharing over here okay\num so uh firstly is what it is like to\nwork as a data analyst at Microsoft is\nlike it's a definitely fascinating role\n and uh it definitely comes with a lot of\nopportunities to uh work with different\nand diverse data sets it can be very\nsimple data said it can be very complex\none right so all of this is done to\nextract meaningful insights um you would\nbe helping data scientists program\nmanagers the data managers you would be\nhelping uh engineering people uh it\ncould be anyone you could be helping\nwith these data analysis business or\nanalyst or there many um more\nopportunities that you get as a data\nanalyst at Microsoft to um help people\nand collaborate with them so uh it's all\nabout you know blending analytical\nskills with the Microsoft robus tools\nand platforms that's available generally\nit's Microsoft tools and platforms if\nyou're working in Microsoft um it is\nsome sometimes inhouse tools and\nsometimes it is borrowed tools it can be\nalso tools that's widely used across the\nglobe as well um and what it is involves\nis like telling data stories to solve\nbusiness problems and how you can enable\nB uh businesses to gain insights for\nmaking the right decision so um based on\nyour team's work or your individual work\nuh a product can be shipped or stoed as\n so that's how uh it can go Global\nit cannot go Global so data analysis can\nplay a big role um again how how much\ndata from where you're getting the data\nalso plays a a big role so uh\nproficiency uh matters a lot and being\nproficient in performing data analysis\nand proposing solution to enhance\nprocesses and performance uh while you\nidentify the areas for improvement using\nyour analyticals and problem solving\nskills right so the more experience you\nhave the more uh uh things you can get\nto the table the ideas the problems and\neverything you can solve if you have\ngood experience or good Hands-On tools\nor if you are aware of what uh you are\ngoing to solve and how you can solve\nright if you if you have some background\nknowledge then you you can solve it\neasily or you might if you don't have\nthat knowledge then you might end up\nbeing in uh a place where you're not\nhaving any knowledge on how to solve\nright so it's better to have more and\nmore experiences and more and more\nlearning\nat Microsoft it's generally told that\nit's a continuous learning thing and not\nonly Microsoft but I think it's it's in\nentire Fang and all the uh big companies\nsay that you need to continuously learn\nwith Advent of AI obviously there's so\nmany things that you need to keep\nlearning um so what do you think when\nyou apply at Microsoft matters uh\nbecause uh how would you prepare your\nmind then right so\nuh uh you need to uh do like why are you\napplying at Microsoft it's it's Prestige\nand Mobility that you need to take care\nof uh like basically applying at\nMicrosoft is something which is\nprestigious if you you would think that\nokay if somebody is working at Microsoft\nit means something a lot and even\nworldwide you can see that um having a\nfan company on your resume significantly\nenhances your um market desirability and\njob right so uh this Prestige\ncan lead to better career opportunities\nand U sometimes higher salary so you\nwill have access to latest Technologies\nand tools as well while enhancing your\nskills in productivity so uh this is\nlike the latest tools you having so you\nare solving the latest problems uh\nsometimes those problems are not solved\nby uh uh some other people so those are\nunique problems so you are solving those\nproblems and uh at at these big\ncompanies you have an opportunity to\ncollaboratively work with people you\nhave competitive benefits so there is a\nthing that you can specialize on and\ndefinitely you will have a a role and a\nproject for that then uh you can work on\nhigh impact projects uh at these\ncompanies but again how to prepare just\nto cut you I'm really sorry to cut you\nin middle I just wanted to check is are\nyou sharing first slide intentionally or\nare we not able to see\nit uh I'm sharing the first slide okay\n okay sure sure sure thanks\n [Music]\nis it\nbetter actually it was better only I I\nwas just wondering and some other\nLearners were also wondering if you are\nintentionally sharing for slide or you\nhave missed you know\nslide yeah I was just\ntrying to share like how you you would\njust apply and how to prepare the mind\nso uh few things that were at the top of\nmy mind I was trying to share but um\nhowever we can just move on and see okay\none important thing that I was covering\nwas that if you are trying to apply at\nthese companies then you need to make\nsure that you are applying in a very\ncompetitive market because a lot of\npeople are applying there and uh that is\nsomething\nthat people with lot of experience also\ncan apply because they want to get into\nthis place or even the freshers can\napply so uh it totally depends on how\nyou presenting your resume how you are\nuh applying for that particular job so\nyou need to take care of all of these\nthings uh when you uh try to apply for\nthe job because if you want to get into\nan interview then first thing is you\nhave to apply for the job and get an\ninterview call so to achieve that\nuh firstly we'll see what what all roles\nare available for as a data analysis you\ncan see different titles available for\nus uh when we are trying to apply for\ndata analysis in all the companies it's\nnot only restricted to Microsoft but all\nthe companies you're trying to apply for\nyou can have different titles sometimes\nit might be data scientist or data\nengineer as well\n so sometimes the data analyst work on a\nvery simple task\nbe it labeling as well or be it just\nExcel simple Excel or data entry also\nsometimes that can also happen or it can\ngo to complex things like creating ETL\npipelines or creating reports for\ndirectors the partners stakeholders\nmanaging the stakeholders um managing\nthe project insights as well sometimes\nyou will have to work with even the\nproject leads and many other people so\nit can go from a very simple work uh to\na very complex work as well and you\nmight have different uh projects\ndifferent teams hiring data analyst So\nbased on that you might find different\ntitles these are few titles that you\nneed to keep an eye when you're trying\nto apply as a data analyst so\num a few screenshots I have got from\ncarriers. microsoft.com and uh you can\nsee what all qualifications are required\nand you can identify that there are some\nteams which is hiring you can see here\nthat we are a data and applied science\nteam which is hiring for Windows tabat\n so if you're applying for this job then\nyou are going to work with Windows team\nhere and the qualifications that's\nrequired is mathematics and SQL and uh\nability to perform statistical analysis\nand all of these things so I'll quickly\njump to the main sections because it's\nalready 20 minutes so you can see a few\nqualifications over here and uh this is\ncoming from April's job and there's some\nU VX organization hiring this and\num you have few more from other\ncountries not only just India in us also\nthey were hiring and you can see four\nplus locations and here you can see\nagain they are hiring someone who who\nhave mathematical skills so the skills\nskills can vary from being very\ntechnical being very U you see having\nmathematics and statistics heavy to\nmaybe just the data entry sort of thing\nalso\num then you have particularly financial\nanalysis internship opportunities and\nthere are times right now where\ninternships are offered at Microsoft so\nuh why I'm sharing all of these things\nis to get an interview call you need to\nprepare your resume accordingly and we\nneed to analyze the job first what you\nare applying you need to study\nthoroughly what job you're applying just\ndon't simply apply because you are just\nsimply losing your one opportunity out\nthere so try to apply and uh with full\npreparation and you can see that you can\nidentify these responsibilities are\nthere when we have gone through the uh\nopportunities the opportunities that\nI've shared just now you can see that\nthese responsibilities are there so if\nthese things fascinates you these things\nare something that you like then I would\nsuggest that you go for uh this job role\nif you don't have the interest uh it's\ndifficult to do good in the interview as\nwell right and uh you will not\nunderstand few terms if and then the job\nwould become difficult basic thing right\n so uh these are few responsibilities\nthat you need to take care and it's\ncrucial for a data analyst role in\nvarious\norganizations so uh it's you need to\ntake care of these and if it's there\nthen try to include these in your\nresume so how you can tailor your resume\nto get shortlisted at the top companies\nis like you have to firstly keep it very\nsimple and easy to read because uh\nfrankly nobody would really spend time\non figuring out how to read that resume\num I have also heard that uh the resum\nget scanned within 20 seconds also so\nhow much you can cover in that 20\nseconds so try to keep it simple and\neasy um you can provide few links to a\nfew fancy things be powerbi report or\npresentations or all of those things and\nkeep it public if you're trying to\nprovide those links if you are providing\nlinks which are having a uh requests\npermissions and all of that then\nobviously it's not a good experience so\nif you want to do something fancy\nprovide links in your resume that might\nreally if they are interested then they\nwould click on the link and uh get know\nmore about those fancy things in your\nresume so firstly keep it simple and uh\neasy to read or try to avoid as fancy\nthings as possible be like you providing\ndirect data and you don't need to\nfancify it then be concise and to the\npoint exactly what you're trying uh\nachieve through that\nresume put that like you have done a lot\nof courses but again whatever is\nrelevant to that particular job try to\nput that and you can put extra maybe but\n U if your resume is becoming a bit\nlonger just try to keep it concise and\nto the point try to use action verbs uh\nstart each bullet point with a strong\naction verb such as developed managed\nLED implemented and all of that so um\ntry to write from an employer's point of\nview um because uh if suppose you were\nan employer and you were looking at the\nresume so how would it look like and\nwhat you are looking for or you tried it\nin that form that increases your chances\num and um try to highlight relevant\nskills and experiences of qu ify your\nachievements showcase your education\ncertifications courses certifications\nand courses play a big role sometimes\nbecause a lot of people just graduate in\num apply but how can you differentiate\nyourself as having courses and\ncertificates that shows that you're\nenthusiastic and if you're coming from a\ndifferent background and if you want to\napply for that particular job and if\nyou're having a certification that means\nyou're showing an inclination towards\nthat particular role so it is a good uh\nthing that if you're applying courses\nand certification then you're putting it\nin your resume try to use a tools for\ninitial screening um and before that you\ncan also try to have a mentor who can go\nthrough your resume you can uh have like\nAI tools as well uh and you can have\nsomeone uh ge your resume is it looking\ngood bad and uh what problems they are\nfacing on that um then how would you\nshowcase your skills in a smart way is\ntry to uh show the transferable skill if\nyou're coming from a non Tech background\nor you're not coming from a data analyst\nbackground try to highlight those\ntransferable skills more than um any\nother skill uh try to incorporate a\nskills section use action oriented\nlanguage and um show continuous learning\nand certifications if you are having\nsome Gap or if uh you want to show that\nyou are uh going towards that uh\nparticular direction\n so um second I lost up track this one is that we were talking\nabout your how to show your skills if\npossible try to create a resum website\nof yourself portfolio and uh data R\nstory there are so many things that\nthat's there link it try not to have a\nlogin or request option on that keep it\npublic uh and uh so that they can just\nclick on it and get through and um uh\nthat can really be helpful U then try to\nuse some resume\npassing tools like these tools will help\nyou to extract and um standardize your\ndata from your resume\nand these can ensure that your resume is\nformatted correctly and includes all the\nrelevant information so it it basically\nmakes easier for um the the recruiters\nto access your\nskills um so how can you identify the\ntransferable skills is that uh these are\nfew skills that's needed for an\nanalytics background which is uh you\nneed to have the analytical skills\nresearch project management attention to\ndetail so all of these things if you're\nincluding it's adding all the plus\npoints to your um analytical role\nand how you can highlight them uh is\nsomething that you need to uh discuss it\nwith your peers or your uh even research\nwe can have a Course Mentor obviously so\nuh these are few things that that if you\nare trying to get it included in the\nresume and uh some real world projects\nand case studies that I have included is\nI think these are something which is um\nnot so common but you can try if you are\nhaving these real world projects and\ncase studies out of your job if you're\nalready having a job then try to include\nthose projected case studies uh from\nuh your job and you can see that few\nprojects are like sentimental analysis\nit's um quite in a trend these days then\nSmart City traffic management analytics\nwe are seeing that uh there are cities\nwhich are going AI City nowadays so\nbefore that you need to have a lot of\nthings in place if you want to call a\ncity AI City your imagination goes like\neverything is perfect over there in AI\nCity\n so we need to solve few things and their\nanalyticals play a big role and a lot of\nproblems are still not solved over there\n so it's good if you try to spend some\ntime on how you can make those projects\nso these projects can be a big win for\nyou guys if you really have solved some\nreal time problems not just copy pasted\nfrom internet so how you can get part\nfrom a big crowd is that you need to\nsolve some problems by yourself real\ntime problems um and not just copy paste\nfrom internet okay then um before uh\nmoving on to things like how you can um\nlike put some things on your resume that\ncan beat the application tracking\nsystems um I would like to say that if\nyou have any questions regarding the uh\njob boot camp or uh like how you can\nform a road map towards uh becoming a\ndata analyst and uh if you want to talk\nto me mentors like me and um how you can\nget more guidance on all of these things\nbecause sometimes people from industry\ncan give you real time um uh in insights\non how you can make or make your resume\nbetter so for that we have created a\nform um like Gooding ninja is providing\na form to us and you can fill th those\nforms and they can reach out to you or\nyou can put some questions out there\nwhere uh uh they will reach out to you\nif uh they want to uh like address those\nquestions so I would like to ask coding\nners team to share that form with you\nguys this can be helpful to you guys to\nget some kind of mentoring um and we\nwill also get to know what kind of\nquestions are there out there for you\nguys to address it in our next uh\nsection as well so um coding ninja\nstream if you could share that form with\nthe\naudience in the\nchat\n it is already shared uh by uh\nthe coding ninjas team take one or two\nminutes to fulfill this form here you\ncan also get more information on how you\ncan apply to particular job sometimes uh\nyou need help on what to write in the\ncover letter you have a lot of things\n but uh you can't really get into or that\nparticular uh job so coding njas have a\nlot of team from different companies and\nthey have accumulated their own data on\nhow application processes can work and\nthey provide you some\nexpertise um so you can fill those forms\nand uh they can help you in the guidance\nand give you comprehensive training\noffers and things like that so take one\ntwo minutes and then we will continue\nwith\nthis so the uh\nform link is shared\nagain so take your time and fill that\nform meanwhile I will just continue with\nthe PPT and uh see if you could connect\nit's a good opportunity to connect with\nthe mentors and uh many other uh\nresources available with uh coding\nninjas and Noy so try to fill that form\nand see if you can reach out to them all\nright so how you can um beat the uh\napplication tracking system first of all\npeople who don't know application\ntracking system nowadays A lot of people\nare using application tracking system to\nfilter out a lot of resumes since a lot\nof resumes are coming which might not be\nworthy for the job uh so they have built\na tracking system it's a software which\nwould check for basic things like uh it\nit checks for relevant information such\nas your contact details work experiences\neducation and skills keyword matching\nand some um basically it's trying to um\ncheck if you are relevant to that job uh\nsometimes people might apply\nto data analytics job but give a resume\nof a chef so that's completely\nirrelevant and it's not a point of\nrecruiter should not go through all of\nthose things so it's saving time so\nthat's ATS and how you can avoid basic\nthings that ATS is doing that you can uh\nput it in your resume and avoid uh\ngetting rejected at the ATS level right\nso uh check out if there are some\nabbreviations related to the job try to\nexpand them and try\nto put it into parenthesis the full form\nof the ab\nthen you should try to Avid some keyword\nstuffing you know that these\nkeywords are important but don't overdo\nit because um it's definitely important\nto in include the keywords but if you're\nsort of um like overloading it and\nstuffing it it looks unnatural and ATS\ncan also flag that as well like what if\nsomebody is just trying to copy paste\nthe entire job description in the resume\nand sending it it doesn't mean that s\nwill pass that ATS will simply reject\nthat also so uh you need to be take care\nyou need to be taking care of that as\nwell try to take care of the spellings\nin the grammars because um if you're\napplying for artificial intelligence job\nand intelligent spelling is wrong or\nartificial spelling is wrong you might\nlose that job because of just the\nspelling and grammar so uh take care of\nthat keep checking your resume again and\nagain uh and try to use Simple layout\navoid complex formatting and if there's\nmissing contact information how are the\npeople going to contact you so um there\nare few things that I have covered on\nhow to make your resume worth getting\nselected for\ninterview or right uh and once you are\nselected you need to have some story as\nwell to your resume so make sure if you\nhave some story to your resume U then\nthat would increase your chances of like\n okay you have some cognitive thinking\nthat you can make your resume in a a\ndata driven style or you already know\nhow to put things together or cohesive\nmanner so it's it can be depicted\nthrough your resume and uh how you can\ndo that is you can have a story to tell\nthrough your resume that you can tell\nwhen you are asked about me section or\nuh run through your resume so you can um\ntell it in a story form uh try to put it\nin a visual form if possible and share\nthe link in the resume or you can\npresent it while interview and always\ntry to focus on impact uh so when you're\ngiving your basic first round uh to what\nexactly you bringing to the table you\ncan put these things and have more\nconfidence when you are asked about\nabout me or run through your resume\nthese things are something which is uh\npeople know but people uh try to\nhesitate or they get nervous at these\npoint and maybe mess up also and they\nmight also think that okay if the uh\nrecruiter is already having my resume\nthen why should I run through it uh this\nis something that you can put forward\nand you can make yourself stand out\nright so instead of just going through\nbasic a thing of education and this and\nthat you're just crafting a story out of\nthat so you can have a data driven story\nand this is one example that I'm trying\nto project here where you can have the\nintroduction how you did the data\ncollection analysis results\nimplementation what was the impact and\nconcluded with you should have a\nconclusion to the story so you can\ninclude all of these things uh uh\nincluded in your resume and in your\nfirst uh question that you put in as in\nlike explain about your job or the basic\nquestions that you\nget um sorry that's um that's coming\nfrom my mobile so um this is one uh\nexample coming from uh one of the\nresumes that I Tred to make where uh you\ncan say that hey I'm a data analytics\nspecialist with five years of experience\nyou're basically putting your\nprofessional summary then you're\nsummarizing your work experience what\nprojects what skills you applied and\nwhat was the impact of it uh if you try\nto put those things in your resume in\nthis way and you try to put that and in\nthe top most section the people if they\nare trying to scan your resume the first\nlines they would scan and they would see\n there's some story to it and they\nwould understand okay these skills are\nrequired for this project and\nuh so that's how they they would create\na cohesive thing and this would slightly\nmake your resum better and Polished one\num few resum mistakes that can sabotage\nyour chances like U having spelling\ngrammar I think this one I can skip\num so few things that you need to uh\ntake care when you are trying to to\nprepare for Microsoft interviews is\nresarch the company stay updated with\nthe latest news uh because there might\nbe questions and some problems might\ncome into uh your plate when uh\ninterview is going on because they\nreally have that problem and it's coming\nfrom the recent uh things like if you\nwould say uh Microsoft have announced\nthe maybe co-pilot going really big or\neven Google is trying to achieve uh\nsomething through but there are some\nproblems that they are facing you can be\nsomeone who's solving that right or you\nhave some Vision to solve that problem\nso that's how the research in the\ncompany uh takes comes into the picture\nand you can put that you try to include\nthat when you're trying to show your\nreal time projects or research or\nanything of that so try to include that\nwhen interviewer ask you question so um\none very important thing is this\nresearch a job as well if you are\napplying for a job that means you're\ntrying to solve a problem at a company\nso I generally feel that if there is a a\njob opening then they're definitely\ntrying to solve a problem so what\nproblem are they trying to solve this or\nyou can try to understand and what\nSolutions are you offering that you can\noffer through this then you should need\nto understand the interview process\nsometimes so it is available in the\nmarket sometimes you can ask your HR you\ncan ask the interviewer themselves like\nwhat would be the process what are the\nrounds and things like that the it can\nbe same as what they telling or they can\nit can be something more uh depending on\nhow they are assessing you try to do\npractice uh um some virtual interviews\nwith your mentors peers or use some\ntools um courses all of those things so\nit becomes necessary when you're not\ndoing it for the first time in the first\ntime you might make some glitches that\nyou can avoid when you do some practices\nand prepare for technical interviews\nthere are lot of experiences shared\nabout technical interviews so prepare\nfor those and if you're applying for a\ntechnical role make sure you know a lot\nof things because they can ask you any\nproblem and if you are very um open and\nvery uh true to what exactly\nuh you know is what they are looking for\ndon't try to Bluff that you know these\nthings and then uh in the interview they\ncan basically judge you out that you\ndon't know all of these things because\nthink from the perspective that they\nhave gone through a lot of resumes and\nalso they can H because they are sitting\nat a very expertise level so they can\nunderstand if you're trying to fake it\n so I would say don't try to fake it and\ndon't try to lie especially at these\ncompanies it may not work for you and\nyou might not even get a feedback that\nhey you are lying or you faking it out\n so straight out say no further processes\nso try to get the expertise and then\nonly attend these interviews there will\nbe behavioral questions for that you can\nuh apply star framework which is a\nsituation task action and result uh this\nis very common framework it's in\nFriendly these days and also good way to\nanswer behavioral questions like what\nwas the situation if there was a\nconflict between your team member how\ndid you solve it and what actions did\nyou take um you reached out to your\nmanager you solved it by yourself you\nreached out to that person you KN it\ndown and then it resolved came to a\ncommon Point all of these things you can\ntell and result what was it like okay\nyou could work in Harmony and you treeve\nsomething through that within 10 days 5\ndays whatever so uh try to put numbers\nas well over here in the results back\nwhat was it so those things can be of\nbrownie points on uh if there are some\nproblems that's already existing in the\nteam every team would have some of the\nother problem and your behavioral\nquestions would bring maybe new flavor\nto the team or or you might even blend\nin the team they looking for so this is\ncompletely luck based or even if you ask\nfew questions to the uh recruiter that\nhow is the team what you expecting from\nme as a team member then also you can\nget to know exactly what they are\nlooking for uh you as a team member then\num know your\ncompetencies um and what exactly is\nrequired in the job um it's the same as\nuh previous one that we have covered\nthat is uh technical interviews if you\nhave uh then how you're going to cover\nthat the same way you you should know\nyour competencies or if you can have\nsome more competencies apart from\ntechnical like you have adaptability you\nhave collaboration or you solve some\ncustomer problems stakeholders problems\nsome problems that your manager were\nfacing they were not able to solve but\nyou solved it um eat the frog is some\nterm that they use so those things if\nyou have done in your job or in your\nuniversities then you can um put it over\nhere be prepared to demonstrate these\ncompetencies through your past\nexperiences um try to pull the\ninterviewers that they can see these\ncompetencies as well but don't overdo\ndon't waste their time if you're not\nlooking for it sometimes they might be\nso it depends on how you're trying to\ngauge their body language as well and\ndon't try to bore them so uh make sure\nthat you're trying to put some\ninteresting facts that can be\ninteresting to them so if there might be\nfew things that it might be not plugging\nthem or at that time but you bring that\nup as your strength then that would be\nbrowny point to you that okay um these\nthings that they can add to the team and\nit is a long du thing or a problem which\nis lying out there but it's not getting\nsolved but you can solve so that can\nincrease your chance ances of getting\nselected um and um like if you are not\nfrom uh the same city you can request\nfor the\naccommodations uh if needed if you're\nhaving little problem then you can try\nto request for the accomodation and if\nyou're a right candidate and uh all that\nall that thing you're bringing to the\ntable uh then they would be lenient to\ngive you the accommodation so it's good\nto ask if you want so that uh you see um\nyou can get what you want to prepare\ngood for your\ninterview uh it it doesn't mean that\nyou're asking them for accommodations in\na hotel or anything of that sort but\nsomething like uh um if I'm trying to\nsay that you're a woman and you want\nsome online interview process or\nsomething of that sort maybe for some\nreason then you can try to say that hey\nuh I'm on so and so break and I would\nwant an online interview so those things\nif possible you can ask basic things uh\nsome small things that can make your\ninterview process easy don't uh Forst\nthem for those accommodations but if\nneeded only ask them few interview\nrounds that would appear to you guys are\nthese and these are few that I have\nobserved so far and heard stories and\nhave gone through few of them so these\ninterview rounds are some things which\nare very common but there can be few\nmore um but I cannot think of anything\nthat might be missing over here but in\ncase you guys think there's something\nmissing do let us know that you have\nexperienced some interview round apart\nfrom these uh at our fangs and Ms and\nall of those and we have not included\nlet me know in chat uh so these are few\ninterview rounds on initial screening\nwould be done um there would be video\ncall phone call with an HR Rec or the\ninitial screen around and uh here they\nwould assess your background experience\ninterest in the role they might discuss\nyour resume and relevant projects your\nexpectations from the job all of those\nthings and notice period all of those\nthings might be asked here then there's\nsomething called cognitive assessments\nwhich are the test um which checks your\num mental functions and ability uh for\ncrucial tasks that might be there with\nthem it involves basically the um\nanalytical round the reasoning round the\nproblem solving and uh your\ncomprehension and all of that so it\nmight be needed for few jobs uh it might\nnot be needed as well so this is sort of\nan optional round uh but generally in\nanalytical role you need some kind of\nskills uh that should be projected here\nas an analytical skill so it includes it\ncan include aptitude test also aptitude\ntest quantitative test all of those\nthings come in these rounds and there's\ntechnical interview rounds which is\nhighly related to the job they might ask\nyou what things you have done they might\nask you about the tools be prepared you\ncan uh be asked many depth questions\nhere in technical interview rounds and\nhow you approach the problems uh for\nthose particular technical problems uh\nso it can again vary from beginner level\nto advanced level as well so depending\non what kind of job and what interviewer\nis looking for in the candidate they can\num put these um question questions out\nthere so you can expect questions like\nour difference between power and tblo\nexplain Dax or how did you uh do some\nkind of\nanalysis when such problem existed so\nthis can also lead to scenario based\nquestions where they would put you into\na scenario and they would say that how\nare you going to address this scenario\nit shows your time management skill your\nyour um approach to a problem your\nability to solve a problem and what\ntools you know how you can you know any\nFrameworks and all of those things come\nin uh picture over here so some examples\nlike you have uh some sales metrics data\nnow create a dashboard showing monthly\nrevenue or you want to show this data to\nthe stakeholder how are you going to\ncreate the report sometimes you might\nhave to create reports\num like about 10 to 15 in a month as\nwell uh for different stakeholders or\nyou might have to create a new one or\nsomething of that sort so how you going\nto um address those issues at your job\nthat will be assessed over here then um\nthere'll be something like based on how\nyou're solving your Solutions and\neverything they would ask questions like\nhow can you handle data from multiple\nsources maybe you have solved the\nproblem entirely what they were looking\nfor or they might be thinking that okay\nyou have a good approach but there are\nfew more things that they need to add so\nthey would add here that okay you want\nto handle data from multiple sources and\nhow you can do that all of those things\ncan be asked over here so be prepared\nwhen you are uh going for this then uh\nsomething similar would be Hands-On\nassessment where companies might provide\nyou some links and some home uh like\nthey would ask you to solve it in 24\nhours or uh they would give you some\ntime period and put a Hands-On\nassessment and uh you need to solve that\nand give it to them um on a proper tool\nand everything so here again it can be\ncreation of the reports or solving some\nSQL\nqueries excuse me so those things can\ncome over here again behavioral\nquestions are something that I have\ncovered already uh here something would\nbe like how would you handle tight\ndeadlines and are you more someone who\nworks independently or you need some\nhandholding uh sometimes they need\ncollaborative so they want people to get\nhand holded sometimes they want people\nto be independent it depends on teams\nmanagers so uh it's on you also you can\nask ask what kind of things they are\nexpecting from you then managerial and\nTeam interview is very important round\nand you will definitely have this round\nand uh one uh optional round can be\ndomain specific questions like if you're\napplying for a a finance uh data\nanalysis or you're trying to apply for a\ndata applied sciences analytics role\nthen um all of those things will have a\nparticular domain specific questions uh\nthose you need to be prepared for okay\nin the managerial round you would meet\nthe hiring manager uh it is for sure\nthat you would meet hiring manager in\nonce in all your interview rounds and uh\nin this generally what is checked is do\nyou uh fit in the team uh or not mostly\nand they would also see your experience\nwhat's your motivation and all of those\nthings so\nwith this I think we have covered almost\nevery round of the interviews and we\nhave four minutes left in this I would\ntry to address as many questions and\npossible and um um I would also seek\nsome questions if there's something for\ncoding njas so moving on to our Q&A\nsession um few questions that I'm\ngetting from the chat as well um Sophia\nI don't know what previous slide you\nwere looking at so I'm excluding that a\nb will CH gbt shorted resume can be\ncaught or reject by\nATS uh even if it is getting caught I\nthink there's no harm if it is uh like\nchat GPT one why not but again I think\nwe have seen one post recently where\nsomebody have just copy pasted from chat\nGP where they have not included the\nexperience but they have included\nsomething that chat gbt told here you\ncan include the experience right so you\nneed to customize obviously right you're\napplying for such big opportunity try to\nput in efforts is what I can say so\nthere's no harm in using charb and AI\ntools but make sure you're using it with\nsome intelligence in some\nwisdom um okay and nagas is telling\nlearn statistics before practice the\nexploratory data analysis um yes basic\none would be\nneeded\num I'm not able to find the Q&A session\nwhere oh okay the recording would be shared\nto us after the session uh it will be\navailable on the portal so you can reach\nout from there does our resume have to\ngo through ATS yes every resume even if\nthe internal candidates are applying um\nthrough the portal that goes through ATS\nand our resum also get rejected if it's\nnot following the ATS things\n so yes ATS uh\nwill come into the\npicture I heard that there few things\nfor voice breaking unble to hear I hope\nit was good and able to capture the\ninformation I did not read that um in\nthe middle in my session but it was only\nin the beginning I guess not later so\nfew more questions are there but mostly\nI feel is related\nto uh job boot Camp so I will hand it\nover to coding ninja team there's one\nlast question how to tackle case study\nquestions case study questions again you\nneed to um show what you have really\ndone don't fake out and uh try to show\nwhat problem you have done what problem\nyou have solved what was the problem\nstatement what tools you have used so uh\nand always have an impact um statement\nlike what was the impact what was your\ntime management skill over there\nhighlight your skills over here which\nare your strengths and also if you try\nto show some of your weaknesses that you\nhave overcome through those case studies\nand um if you got to know something you\nhave improved then that also mentioned\nover here so I hope that answers your\nquestion um the rest questions are some\nsomething related to coding ninja so I\nwill hand it over to them um coding\nninja team you could take it over for\nfurther\nquestions hey hi thank you so much for\nsuch an insightful session and with that\nI can see a lot of questions around K\nNinja's job boot camp and for for that\nwe have senior program expert from our\nteam and he will take over and will\nexplain how this uh you know coding\nninas job boot camp in data analytics\ncan be ideal Road for you so just 5 to\n10 minutes whoever wants to understand\nabout this know more about this they can\nstay and uh uh can keep dropping their\nquestions in chat box because we will be\ncatering to them uh by the end of the uh\nyou\nknow 5 10 minutes within more five more\nminutes I guess yeah K now over to\nyou yeah thank you thank you so much so\nI would like to thank the mentor for\nsuch an insightful session and hi\neveryone so my name is Karan and I am\nthe senior program expert from job boot\n\n",

    "everyone and um happy weekend so I hope\nit's a good start of your weekend and um\nfirst of all kudos to you guys that\nyou're using this weekend morning um\nafternoon for some it might be morning\nas well so uh you're using it to up\nskill and to know how you can advance in\nyour career so uh from the chat um\nI'm trying to get to know the audience\nand um\nI see that a few of them are saying that\num abishek is saying that they are new\nto data analytics and uh there Sophia\nwho is from MSE information technology\nand she's currently doing internship and\ndata analytics so um resume not getting\nshortlisted is one problem yes because\nuh there can be multiple things out\nthere uh one that you might be applying\nto a job where uh there are a lot of\npeople who are applying to it and the\nselection is already done\nor recently I was reading in the news\nthat people are also saying that if\nyou're over qualified then also you\nmight not really get into that was just\noneof situation but generally you get\nthe interview calls um so today's\nsession we are going to see that how you\ncan crack an interview in Microsoft of a\ndata analyst so before that I would like\nto introduce myself um I have been\nworking with Microsoft from past um like\nfrom the start of my career and I was\none among the top 10 uh data analyst in\nMicrosoft India where uh uh we were just\nstarting the data analyst team in\nMicrosoft so it was pretty new uh job\nprofile for Microsoft team as well uh\nall that while it was Data analysis was\ndone through the third parties and not\nreally from at the like from the fds\nlevel the full-time level so uh it was a\ngreat venture to know exactly how uh the\nthe pilot version of data analytics team\nhas formed and we have come so far now\nuh and we see that nowadays like data\nanalysis is really uh something that\neverybody talks about and it's needed so\nin my career I have worked B about 25 to\n32 it was uh not only just being but\nthere are many other products that I\nhave worked in Microsoft so uh it was a\ngreat experience as I had got an um\nchance to work on diverse data sets and\nuh there were different challenges in uh\ndifferent uh products so uh there were\nproducts from B there were products from\ncotana copilot recent one was copilot\nthere something you you guys have heard\nof uh Viva topics uh that is something\nthat we have been working on and uh\nevery now and then there are different\ntools that we get to uh work with as a\nMicrosoft data analytics in during my\ncareer I've also got a chance to uh be a\nsite lead for the semantic machines team\nwhich was becoming uh like Cortana was\nbecoming semantic so before the copilot\nstory uh the Cortana existed and we were\ntrying to um like uh reform quana into a\nversion who would understand semantic\num I think that's about my my\ncareer uh for now and we will quickly\ndelve into the topic for today like how\nwe want to actually track the interview\nof data analytics at Microsoft um so for\nthat um a couple\nmore okay is if my voice is breaking\nagain then let me know uh I hope it is\nbetter now\n so uh there are few questions that's\ncoming in so do pour in your questions\nfor me for coding ninjas and uh also\ncoding ninjas is working with no.com so\nin case you have any questions for um\nall of them and regarding job boot camp\nuh since coding Ninja's job boot camp is\nalso sponsor in the session so if you\nhave any questions regarding all of\nthese things do pour in in Q&A we will\nanswer it at the end of the session and\nin between also we will try to address\nfew uh questions if there are any okay\n so I'll start with sharing my screen\nthat I have prepared I have charted down\nall the possible um tips and tricks that\nworked for me for my uh from my mentors\nfor my mentees I have prepared if there\nare uh some things that they wanted to\nlearn from it and uh these are few\nthings that I have learned from my team\nmembers from my managers uh what worked\nwell and what did not work well so uh\none thing I would want to uh share is\nthat\nuh this is just the best practices and\nit is not a short short method to crack\nthe uh interview at data like as a data\nanalyst in Microsoft uh because every\nteam might have their own uh set of uh\nrequirements or problem to solve So\nbased on that they would put different\ntype of rounds and different type of\nproblems challenges that you have to\nsolve uh using these\nuh in this job right so based on that\nyou will have different rounds or\ndifferent way that they would check your\nskills okay so depends on managers\ndepends on team as well like um if they\ncan be a team of 30 members they are\ntrying to fit you in and you need to\nknow how to work with those people there\ncan be remote settings there can be\npeople who are working with clients\noffshore so all of these things\nsituations would occur and based on that\ndifferent situations will be there and\nuh there'll be different way of gauging\num a candidate and this is something\nthat worked for me and few of the people\nthat I know in my network so that's what\nI'm sharing over here okay\num so uh firstly is what it is like to\nwork as a data analyst at Microsoft is\nlike it's a definitely fascinating role\n and uh it definitely comes with a lot of\nopportunities to uh work with different\nand diverse data sets it can be very\nsimple data said it can be very complex\none right so all of this is done to\nextract meaningful insights um you would\nbe helping data scientists program\nmanagers the data managers you would be\nhelping uh engineering people uh it\ncould be anyone you could be helping\nwith these data analysis business or\nanalyst or there many um more\nopportunities that you get as a data\nanalyst at Microsoft to um help people\nand collaborate with them so uh it's all\nabout you know blending analytical\nskills with the Microsoft robus tools\nand platforms that's available generally\nit's Microsoft tools and platforms if\nyou're working in Microsoft um it is\nsome sometimes inhouse tools and\nsometimes it is borrowed tools it can be\nalso tools that's widely used across the\nglobe as well um and what it is involves\nis like telling data stories to solve\nbusiness problems and how you can enable\nB uh businesses to gain insights for\nmaking the right decision so um based on\nyour team's work or your individual work\nuh a product can be shipped or stoed as\n so that's how uh it can go Global\nit cannot go Global so data analysis can\nplay a big role um again how how much\ndata from where you're getting the data\nalso plays a a big role so uh\nproficiency uh matters a lot and being\nproficient in performing data analysis\nand proposing solution to enhance\nprocesses and performance uh while you\nidentify the areas for improvement using\nyour analyticals and problem solving\nskills right so the more experience you\nhave the more uh uh things you can get\nto the table the ideas the problems and\neverything you can solve if you have\ngood experience or good Hands-On tools\nor if you are aware of what uh you are\ngoing to solve and how you can solve\nright if you if you have some background\nknowledge then you you can solve it\neasily or you might if you don't have\nthat knowledge then you might end up\nbeing in uh a place where you're not\nhaving any knowledge on how to solve\nright so it's better to have more and\nmore experiences and more and more\nlearning\nat Microsoft it's generally told that\nit's a continuous learning thing and not\nonly Microsoft but I think it's it's in\nentire Fang and all the uh big companies\nsay that you need to continuously learn\nwith Advent of AI obviously there's so\nmany things that you need to keep\nlearning um so what do you think when\nyou apply at Microsoft matters uh\nbecause uh how would you prepare your\nmind then right so\nuh uh you need to uh do like why are you\napplying at Microsoft it's it's Prestige\nand Mobility that you need to take care\nof uh like basically applying at\nMicrosoft is something which is\nprestigious if you you would think that\nokay if somebody is working at Microsoft\nit means something a lot and even\nworldwide you can see that um having a\nfan company on your resume significantly\nenhances your um market desirability and\njob right so uh this Prestige\ncan lead to better career opportunities\nand U sometimes higher salary so you\nwill have access to latest Technologies\nand tools as well while enhancing your\nskills in productivity so uh this is\nlike the latest tools you having so you\nare solving the latest problems uh\nsometimes those problems are not solved\nby uh uh some other people so those are\nunique problems so you are solving those\nproblems and uh at at these big\ncompanies you have an opportunity to\ncollaboratively work with people you\nhave competitive benefits so there is a\nthing that you can specialize on and\ndefinitely you will have a a role and a\nproject for that then uh you can work on\nhigh impact projects uh at these\ncompanies but again how to prepare just\nto cut you I'm really sorry to cut you\nin middle I just wanted to check is are\nyou sharing first slide intentionally or\nare we not able to see\nit uh I'm sharing the first slide okay\n okay sure sure sure thanks\n [Music]\nis it\nbetter actually it was better only I I\nwas just wondering and some other\nLearners were also wondering if you are\nintentionally sharing for slide or you\nhave missed you know\nslide yeah I was just\ntrying to share like how you you would\njust apply and how to prepare the mind\nso uh few things that were at the top of\nmy mind I was trying to share but um\nhowever we can just move on and see okay\none important thing that I was covering\nwas that if you are trying to apply at\nthese companies then you need to make\nsure that you are applying in a very\ncompetitive market because a lot of\npeople are applying there and uh that is\nsomething\nthat people with lot of experience also\ncan apply because they want to get into\nthis place or even the freshers can\napply so uh it totally depends on how\nyou presenting your resume how you are\nuh applying for that particular job so\nyou need to take care of all of these\nthings uh when you uh try to apply for\nthe job because if you want to get into\nan interview then first thing is you\nhave to apply for the job and get an\ninterview call so to achieve that\nuh firstly we'll see what what all roles\nare available for as a data analysis you\ncan see different titles available for\nus uh when we are trying to apply for\ndata analysis in all the companies it's\nnot only restricted to Microsoft but all\nthe companies you're trying to apply for\nyou can have different titles sometimes\nit might be data scientist or data\nengineer as well\n so sometimes the data analyst work on a\nvery simple task\nbe it labeling as well or be it just\nExcel simple Excel or data entry also\nsometimes that can also happen or it can\ngo to complex things like creating ETL\npipelines or creating reports for\ndirectors the partners stakeholders\nmanaging the stakeholders um managing\nthe project insights as well sometimes\nyou will have to work with even the\nproject leads and many other people so\nit can go from a very simple work uh to\na very complex work as well and you\nmight have different uh projects\ndifferent teams hiring data analyst So\nbased on that you might find different\ntitles these are few titles that you\nneed to keep an eye when you're trying\nto apply as a data analyst so\num a few screenshots I have got from\ncarriers.",
    "microsoft.com and uh you can\nsee what all qualifications are required\nand you can identify that there are some\nteams which is hiring you can see here\nthat we are a data and applied science\nteam which is hiring for Windows tabat\n so if you're applying for this job then\nyou are going to work with Windows team\nhere and the qualifications that's\nrequired is mathematics and SQL and uh\nability to perform statistical analysis\nand all of these things so I'll quickly\njump to the main sections because it's\nalready 20 minutes so you can see a few\nqualifications over here and uh this is\ncoming from April's job and there's some\nU VX organization hiring this and\num you have few more from other\ncountries not only just India in us also\nthey were hiring and you can see four\nplus locations and here you can see\nagain they are hiring someone who who\nhave mathematical skills so the skills\nskills can vary from being very\ntechnical being very U you see having\nmathematics and statistics heavy to\nmaybe just the data entry sort of thing\nalso\num then you have particularly financial\nanalysis internship opportunities and\nthere are times right now where\ninternships are offered at Microsoft so\nuh why I'm sharing all of these things\nis to get an interview call you need to\nprepare your resume accordingly and we\nneed to analyze the job first what you\nare applying you need to study\nthoroughly what job you're applying just\ndon't simply apply because you are just\nsimply losing your one opportunity out\nthere so try to apply and uh with full\npreparation and you can see that you can\nidentify these responsibilities are\nthere when we have gone through the uh\nopportunities the opportunities that\nI've shared just now you can see that\nthese responsibilities are there so if\nthese things fascinates you these things\nare something that you like then I would\nsuggest that you go for uh this job role\nif you don't have the interest uh it's\ndifficult to do good in the interview as\nwell right and uh you will not\nunderstand few terms if and then the job\nwould become difficult basic thing right\n so uh these are few responsibilities\nthat you need to take care and it's\ncrucial for a data analyst role in\nvarious\norganizations so uh it's you need to\ntake care of these and if it's there\nthen try to include these in your\nresume so how you can tailor your resume\nto get shortlisted at the top companies\nis like you have to firstly keep it very\nsimple and easy to read because uh\nfrankly nobody would really spend time\non figuring out how to read that resume\num I have also heard that uh the resum\nget scanned within 20 seconds also so\nhow much you can cover in that 20\nseconds so try to keep it simple and\neasy um you can provide few links to a\nfew fancy things be powerbi report or\npresentations or all of those things and\nkeep it public if you're trying to\nprovide those links if you are providing\nlinks which are having a uh requests\npermissions and all of that then\nobviously it's not a good experience so\nif you want to do something fancy\nprovide links in your resume that might\nreally if they are interested then they\nwould click on the link and uh get know\nmore about those fancy things in your\nresume so firstly keep it simple and uh\neasy to read or try to avoid as fancy\nthings as possible be like you providing\ndirect data and you don't need to\nfancify it then be concise and to the\npoint exactly what you're trying uh\nachieve through that\nresume put that like you have done a lot\nof courses but again whatever is\nrelevant to that particular job try to\nput that and you can put extra maybe but\n U if your resume is becoming a bit\nlonger just try to keep it concise and\nto the point try to use action verbs uh\nstart each bullet point with a strong\naction verb such as developed managed\nLED implemented and all of that so um\ntry to write from an employer's point of\nview um because uh if suppose you were\nan employer and you were looking at the\nresume so how would it look like and\nwhat you are looking for or you tried it\nin that form that increases your chances\num and um try to highlight relevant\nskills and experiences of qu ify your\nachievements showcase your education\ncertifications courses certifications\nand courses play a big role sometimes\nbecause a lot of people just graduate in\num apply but how can you differentiate\nyourself as having courses and\ncertificates that shows that you're\nenthusiastic and if you're coming from a\ndifferent background and if you want to\napply for that particular job and if\nyou're having a certification that means\nyou're showing an inclination towards\nthat particular role so it is a good uh\nthing that if you're applying courses\nand certification then you're putting it\nin your resume try to use a tools for\ninitial screening um and before that you\ncan also try to have a mentor who can go\nthrough your resume you can uh have like\nAI tools as well uh and you can have\nsomeone uh ge your resume is it looking\ngood bad and uh what problems they are\nfacing on that um then how would you\nshowcase your skills in a smart way is\ntry to uh show the transferable skill if\nyou're coming from a non Tech background\nor you're not coming from a data analyst\nbackground try to highlight those\ntransferable skills more than um any\nother skill uh try to incorporate a\nskills section use action oriented\nlanguage and um show continuous learning\nand certifications if you are having\nsome Gap or if uh you want to show that\nyou are uh going towards that uh\nparticular direction\n so um second I lost up track this one is that we were talking\nabout your how to show your skills if\npossible try to create a resum website\nof yourself portfolio and uh data R\nstory there are so many things that\nthat's there link it try not to have a\nlogin or request option on that keep it\npublic uh and uh so that they can just\nclick on it and get through and um uh\nthat can really be helpful U then try to\nuse some resume\npassing tools like these tools will help\nyou to extract and um standardize your\ndata from your resume\nand these can ensure that your resume is\nformatted correctly and includes all the\nrelevant information so it it basically\nmakes easier for um the the recruiters\nto access your\nskills um so how can you identify the\ntransferable skills is that uh these are\nfew skills that's needed for an\nanalytics background which is uh you\nneed to have the analytical skills\nresearch project management attention to\ndetail so all of these things if you're\nincluding it's adding all the plus\npoints to your um analytical role\nand how you can highlight them uh is\nsomething that you need to uh discuss it\nwith your peers or your uh even research\nwe can have a Course Mentor obviously so\nuh these are few things that that if you\nare trying to get it included in the\nresume and uh some real world projects\nand case studies that I have included is\nI think these are something which is um\nnot so common but you can try if you are\nhaving these real world projects and\ncase studies out of your job if you're\nalready having a job then try to include\nthose projected case studies uh from\nuh your job and you can see that few\nprojects are like sentimental analysis\nit's um quite in a trend these days then\nSmart City traffic management analytics\nwe are seeing that uh there are cities\nwhich are going AI City nowadays so\nbefore that you need to have a lot of\nthings in place if you want to call a\ncity AI City your imagination goes like\neverything is perfect over there in AI\nCity\n so we need to solve few things and their\nanalyticals play a big role and a lot of\nproblems are still not solved over there\n so it's good if you try to spend some\ntime on how you can make those projects\nso these projects can be a big win for\nyou guys if you really have solved some\nreal time problems not just copy pasted\nfrom internet so how you can get part\nfrom a big crowd is that you need to\nsolve some problems by yourself real\ntime problems um and not just copy paste\nfrom internet okay then um before uh\nmoving on to things like how you can um\nlike put some things on your resume that\ncan beat the application tracking\nsystems um I would like to say that if\nyou have any questions regarding the uh\njob boot camp or uh like how you can\nform a road map towards uh becoming a\ndata analyst and uh if you want to talk\nto me mentors like me and um how you can\nget more guidance on all of these things\nbecause sometimes people from industry\ncan give you real time um uh in insights\non how you can make or make your resume\nbetter so for that we have created a\nform um like Gooding ninja is providing\na form to us and you can fill th those\nforms and they can reach out to you or\nyou can put some questions out there\nwhere uh uh they will reach out to you\nif uh they want to uh like address those\nquestions so I would like to ask coding\nners team to share that form with you\nguys this can be helpful to you guys to\nget some kind of mentoring um and we\nwill also get to know what kind of\nquestions are there out there for you\nguys to address it in our next uh\nsection as well so um coding ninja\nstream if you could share that form with\nthe\naudience in the\nchat\n it is already shared uh by uh\nthe coding ninjas team take one or two\nminutes to fulfill this form here you\ncan also get more information on how you\ncan apply to particular job sometimes uh\nyou need help on what to write in the\ncover letter you have a lot of things\n but uh you can't really get into or that\nparticular uh job so coding njas have a\nlot of team from different companies and\nthey have accumulated their own data on\nhow application processes can work and\nthey provide you some\nexpertise um so you can fill those forms\nand uh they can help you in the guidance\nand give you comprehensive training\noffers and things like that so take one\ntwo minutes and then we will continue\nwith\nthis so the uh\nform link is shared\nagain so take your time and fill that\nform meanwhile I will just continue with\nthe PPT and uh see if you could connect\nit's a good opportunity to connect with\nthe mentors and uh many other uh\nresources available with uh coding\nninjas and Noy so try to fill that form\nand see if you can reach out to them all\nright so how you can um beat the uh\napplication tracking system first of all\npeople who don't know application\ntracking system nowadays A lot of people\nare using application tracking system to\nfilter out a lot of resumes since a lot\nof resumes are coming which might not be\nworthy for the job uh so they have built\na tracking system it's a software which\nwould check for basic things like uh it\nit checks for relevant information such\nas your contact details work experiences\neducation and skills keyword matching\nand some um basically it's trying to um\ncheck if you are relevant to that job uh\nsometimes people might apply\nto data analytics job but give a resume\nof a chef so that's completely\nirrelevant and it's not a point of\nrecruiter should not go through all of\nthose things so it's saving time so\nthat's ATS and how you can avoid basic\nthings that ATS is doing that you can uh\nput it in your resume and avoid uh\ngetting rejected at the ATS level right\nso uh check out if there are some\nabbreviations related to the job try to\nexpand them and try\nto put it into parenthesis the full form\nof the ab\nthen you should try to Avid some keyword\nstuffing you know that these\nkeywords are important but don't overdo\nit because um it's definitely important\nto in include the keywords but if you're\nsort of um like overloading it and\nstuffing it it looks unnatural and ATS\ncan also flag that as well like what if\nsomebody is just trying to copy paste\nthe entire job description in the resume\nand sending it it doesn't mean that s\nwill pass that ATS will simply reject\nthat also so uh you need to be take care\nyou need to be taking care of that as\nwell try to take care of the spellings\nin the grammars because um if you're\napplying for artificial intelligence job\nand intelligent spelling is wrong or\nartificial spelling is wrong you might\nlose that job because of just the\nspelling and grammar so uh take care of\nthat keep checking your resume again and\nagain uh and try to use Simple layout\navoid complex formatting and if there's\nmissing contact information how are the\npeople going to contact you so um there\nare few things that I have covered on\nhow to make your resume worth getting\nselected for\ninterview or right uh and once you are\nselected you need to have some story as\nwell to your resume so make sure if you\nhave some story to your resume U then\nthat would increase your chances of like\n okay you have some cognitive thinking\nthat you can make your resume in a a\ndata driven style or you already know\nhow to put things together or cohesive\nmanner so it's it can be depicted\nthrough your resume and uh how you can\ndo that is you can have a story to tell\nthrough your resume that you can tell\nwhen you are asked about me section or\nuh run through your resume so you can um\ntell it in a story form uh try to put it\nin a visual form if possible and share\nthe link in the resume or you can\npresent it while interview and always\ntry to focus on impact uh so when you're\ngiving your basic first round uh to what\nexactly you bringing to the table you\ncan put these things and have more\nconfidence when you are asked about\nabout me or run through your resume\nthese things are something which is uh\npeople know but people uh try to\nhesitate or they get nervous at these\npoint and maybe mess up also and they\nmight also think that okay if the uh\nrecruiter is already having my resume\nthen why should I run through it uh this\nis something that you can put forward\nand you can make yourself stand out\nright so instead of just going through\nbasic a thing of education and this and\nthat you're just crafting a story out of\nthat so you can have a data driven story\nand this is one example that I'm trying\nto project here where you can have the\nintroduction how you did the data\ncollection analysis results\nimplementation what was the impact and\nconcluded with you should have a\nconclusion to the story so you can\ninclude all of these things uh uh\nincluded in your resume and in your\nfirst uh question that you put in as in\nlike explain about your job or the basic\nquestions that you\nget um sorry that's um that's coming\nfrom my mobile so um this is one uh\nexample coming from uh one of the\nresumes that I Tred to make where uh you\ncan say that hey I'm a data analytics\nspecialist with five years of experience\nyou're basically putting your\nprofessional summary then you're\nsummarizing your work experience what\nprojects what skills you applied and\nwhat was the impact of it uh if you try\nto put those things in your resume in\nthis way and you try to put that and in\nthe top most section the people if they\nare trying to scan your resume the first\nlines they would scan and they would see\n there's some story to it and they\nwould understand okay these skills are\nrequired for this project and\nuh so that's how they they would create\na cohesive thing and this would slightly\nmake your resum better and Polished one\num few resum mistakes that can sabotage\nyour chances like U having spelling\ngrammar I think this one I can skip\num so few things that you need to uh\ntake care when you are trying to to\nprepare for Microsoft interviews is\nresarch the company stay updated with\nthe latest news uh because there might\nbe questions and some problems might\ncome into uh your plate when uh\ninterview is going on because they\nreally have that problem and it's coming\nfrom the recent uh things like if you\nwould say uh Microsoft have announced\nthe maybe co-pilot going really big or\neven Google is trying to achieve uh\nsomething through but there are some\nproblems that they are facing you can be\nsomeone who's solving that right or you\nhave some Vision to solve that problem\nso that's how the research in the\ncompany uh takes comes into the picture\nand you can put that you try to include\nthat when you're trying to show your\nreal time projects or research or\nanything of that so try to include that\nwhen interviewer ask you question so um\none very important thing is this\nresearch a job as well if you are\napplying for a job that means you're\ntrying to solve a problem at a company\nso I generally feel that if there is a a\njob opening then they're definitely\ntrying to solve a problem so what\nproblem are they trying to solve this or\nyou can try to understand and what\nSolutions are you offering that you can\noffer through this then you should need\nto understand the interview process\nsometimes so it is available in the\nmarket sometimes you can ask your HR you\ncan ask the interviewer themselves like\nwhat would be the process what are the\nrounds and things like that the it can\nbe same as what they telling or they can\nit can be something more uh depending on\nhow they are assessing you try to do\npractice uh um some virtual interviews\nwith your mentors peers or use some\ntools um courses all of those things so\nit becomes necessary when you're not\ndoing it for the first time in the first\ntime you might make some glitches that\nyou can avoid when you do some practices\nand prepare for technical interviews\nthere are lot of experiences shared\nabout technical interviews so prepare\nfor those and if you're applying for a\ntechnical role make sure you know a lot\nof things because they can ask you any\nproblem and if you are very um open and\nvery uh true to what exactly\nuh you know is what they are looking for\ndon't try to Bluff that you know these\nthings and then uh in the interview they\ncan basically judge you out that you\ndon't know all of these things because\nthink from the perspective that they\nhave gone through a lot of resumes and\nalso they can H because they are sitting\nat a very expertise level so they can\nunderstand if you're trying to fake it\n so I would say don't try to fake it and\ndon't try to lie especially at these\ncompanies it may not work for you and\nyou might not even get a feedback that\nhey you are lying or you faking it out\n so straight out say no further processes\nso try to get the expertise and then\nonly attend these interviews there will\nbe behavioral questions for that you can\nuh apply star framework which is a\nsituation task action and result uh this\nis very common framework it's in\nFriendly these days and also good way to\nanswer behavioral questions like what\nwas the situation if there was a\nconflict between your team member how\ndid you solve it and what actions did\nyou take um you reached out to your\nmanager you solved it by yourself you\nreached out to that person you KN it\ndown and then it resolved came to a\ncommon Point all of these things you can\ntell and result what was it like okay\nyou could work in Harmony and you treeve\nsomething through that within 10 days 5\ndays whatever so uh try to put numbers\nas well over here in the results back\nwhat was it so those things can be of\nbrownie points on uh if there are some\nproblems that's already existing in the\nteam every team would have some of the\nother problem and your behavioral\nquestions would bring maybe new flavor\nto the team or or you might even blend\nin the team they looking for so this is\ncompletely luck based or even if you ask\nfew questions to the uh recruiter that\nhow is the team what you expecting from\nme as a team member then also you can\nget to know exactly what they are\nlooking for uh you as a team member then\num know your\ncompetencies um and what exactly is\nrequired in the job um it's the same as\nuh previous one that we have covered\nthat is uh technical interviews if you\nhave uh then how you're going to cover\nthat the same way you you should know\nyour competencies or if you can have\nsome more competencies apart from\ntechnical like you have adaptability you\nhave collaboration or you solve some\ncustomer problems stakeholders problems\nsome problems that your manager were\nfacing they were not able to solve but\nyou solved it um eat the frog is some\nterm that they use so those things if\nyou have done in your job or in your\nuniversities then you can um put it over\nhere be prepared to demonstrate these\ncompetencies through your past\nexperiences um try to pull the\ninterviewers that they can see these\ncompetencies as well but don't overdo\ndon't waste their time if you're not\nlooking for it sometimes they might be\nso it depends on how you're trying to\ngauge their body language as well and\ndon't try to bore them so uh make sure\nthat you're trying to put some\ninteresting facts that can be\ninteresting to them so if there might be\nfew things that it might be not plugging\nthem or at that time but you bring that\nup as your strength then that would be\nbrowny point to you that okay um these\nthings that they can add to the team and\nit is a long du thing or a problem which\nis lying out there but it's not getting\nsolved but you can solve so that can\nincrease your chance ances of getting\nselected um and um like if you are not\nfrom uh the same city you can request\nfor the\naccommodations uh if needed if you're\nhaving little problem then you can try\nto request for the accomodation and if\nyou're a right candidate and uh all that\nall that thing you're bringing to the\ntable uh then they would be lenient to\ngive you the accommodation so it's good\nto ask if you want so that uh you see um\nyou can get what you want to prepare\ngood for your\ninterview uh it it doesn't mean that\nyou're asking them for accommodations in\na hotel or anything of that sort but\nsomething like uh um if I'm trying to\nsay that you're a woman and you want\nsome online interview process or\nsomething of that sort maybe for some\nreason then you can try to say that hey\nuh I'm on so and so break and I would\nwant an online interview so those things\nif possible you can ask basic things uh\nsome small things that can make your\ninterview process easy don't uh Forst\nthem for those accommodations but if\nneeded only ask them few interview\nrounds that would appear to you guys are\nthese and these are few that I have\nobserved so far and heard stories and\nhave gone through few of them so these\ninterview rounds are some things which\nare very common but there can be few\nmore um but I cannot think of anything\nthat might be missing over here but in\ncase you guys think there's something\nmissing do let us know that you have\nexperienced some interview round apart\nfrom these uh at our fangs and Ms and\nall of those and we have not included\nlet me know in chat uh so these are few\ninterview rounds on initial screening\nwould be done um there would be video\ncall phone call with an HR Rec or the\ninitial screen around and uh here they\nwould assess your background experience\ninterest in the role they might discuss\nyour resume and relevant projects your\nexpectations from the job all of those\nthings and notice period all of those\nthings might be asked here then there's\nsomething called cognitive assessments\nwhich are the test um which checks your\num mental functions and ability uh for\ncrucial tasks that might be there with\nthem it involves basically the um\nanalytical round the reasoning round the\nproblem solving and uh your\ncomprehension and all of that so it\nmight be needed for few jobs uh it might\nnot be needed as well so this is sort of\nan optional round uh but generally in\nanalytical role you need some kind of\nskills uh that should be projected here\nas an analytical skill so it includes it\ncan include aptitude test also aptitude\ntest quantitative test all of those\nthings come in these rounds and there's\ntechnical interview rounds which is\nhighly related to the job they might ask\nyou what things you have done they might\nask you about the tools be prepared you\ncan uh be asked many depth questions\nhere in technical interview rounds and\nhow you approach the problems uh for\nthose particular technical problems uh\nso it can again vary from beginner level\nto advanced level as well so depending\non what kind of job and what interviewer\nis looking for in the candidate they can\num put these um question questions out\nthere so you can expect questions like\nour difference between power and tblo\nexplain Dax or how did you uh do some\nkind of\nanalysis when such problem existed so\nthis can also lead to scenario based\nquestions where they would put you into\na scenario and they would say that how\nare you going to address this scenario\nit shows your time management skill your\nyour um approach to a problem your\nability to solve a problem and what\ntools you know how you can you know any\nFrameworks and all of those things come\nin uh picture over here so some examples\nlike you have uh some sales metrics data\nnow create a dashboard showing monthly\nrevenue or you want to show this data to\nthe stakeholder how are you going to\ncreate the report sometimes you might\nhave to create reports\num like about 10 to 15 in a month as\nwell uh for different stakeholders or\nyou might have to create a new one or\nsomething of that sort so how you going\nto um address those issues at your job\nthat will be assessed over here then um\nthere'll be something like based on how\nyou're solving your Solutions and\neverything they would ask questions like\nhow can you handle data from multiple\nsources maybe you have solved the\nproblem entirely what they were looking\nfor or they might be thinking that okay\nyou have a good approach but there are\nfew more things that they need to add so\nthey would add here that okay you want\nto handle data from multiple sources and\nhow you can do that all of those things\ncan be asked over here so be prepared\nwhen you are uh going for this then uh\nsomething similar would be Hands-On\nassessment where companies might provide\nyou some links and some home uh like\nthey would ask you to solve it in 24\nhours or uh they would give you some\ntime period and put a Hands-On\nassessment and uh you need to solve that\nand give it to them um on a proper tool\nand everything so here again it can be\ncreation of the reports or solving some\nSQL\nqueries excuse me so those things can\ncome over here again behavioral\nquestions are something that I have\ncovered already uh here something would\nbe like how would you handle tight\ndeadlines and are you more someone who\nworks independently or you need some\nhandholding uh sometimes they need\ncollaborative so they want people to get\nhand holded sometimes they want people\nto be independent it depends on teams\nmanagers so uh it's on you also you can\nask ask what kind of things they are\nexpecting from you then managerial and\nTeam interview is very important round\nand you will definitely have this round\nand uh one uh optional round can be\ndomain specific questions like if you're\napplying for a a finance uh data\nanalysis or you're trying to apply for a\ndata applied sciences analytics role\nthen um all of those things will have a\nparticular domain specific questions uh\nthose you need to be prepared for okay\nin the managerial round you would meet\nthe hiring manager uh it is for sure\nthat you would meet hiring manager in\nonce in all your interview rounds and uh\nin this generally what is checked is do\nyou uh fit in the team uh or not mostly\nand they would also see your experience\nwhat's your motivation and all of those\nthings so\nwith this I think we have covered almost\nevery round of the interviews and we\nhave four minutes left in this I would\ntry to address as many questions and\npossible and um um I would also seek\nsome questions if there's something for\ncoding njas so moving on to our Q&A\nsession um few questions that I'm\ngetting from the chat as well um Sophia\nI don't know what previous slide you\nwere looking at so I'm excluding that a\nb will CH gbt shorted resume can be\ncaught or reject by\nATS uh even if it is getting caught I\nthink there's no harm if it is uh like\nchat GPT one why not but again I think\nwe have seen one post recently where\nsomebody have just copy pasted from chat\nGP where they have not included the\nexperience but they have included\nsomething that chat gbt told here you\ncan include the experience right so you\nneed to customize obviously right you're\napplying for such big opportunity try to\nput in efforts is what I can say so\nthere's no harm in using charb and AI\ntools but make sure you're using it with\nsome intelligence in some\nwisdom um okay and nagas is telling\nlearn statistics before practice the\nexploratory data analysis um yes basic\none would be\nneeded\num I'm not able to find the Q&A session\nwhere oh okay the recording would be shared\nto us after the session uh it will be\navailable on the portal so you can reach\nout from there does our resume have to\ngo through ATS yes every resume even if\nthe internal candidates are applying um\nthrough the portal that goes through ATS\nand our resum also get rejected if it's\nnot following the ATS things\n so yes ATS uh\nwill come into the\npicture I heard that there few things\nfor voice breaking unble to hear I hope\nit was good and able to capture the\ninformation I did not read that um in\nthe middle in my session but it was only\nin the beginning I guess not later so\nfew more questions are there but mostly\nI feel is related\nto uh job boot Camp so I will hand it\nover to coding ninja team there's one\nlast question how to tackle case study\nquestions case study questions again you\nneed to um show what you have really\ndone don't fake out and uh try to show\nwhat problem you have done what problem\nyou have solved what was the problem\nstatement what tools you have used so uh\nand always have an impact um statement\nlike what was the impact what was your\ntime management skill over there\nhighlight your skills over here which\nare your strengths and also if you try\nto show some of your weaknesses that you\nhave overcome through those case studies\nand um if you got to know something you\nhave improved then that also mentioned\nover here so I hope that answers your\nquestion um the rest questions are some\nsomething related to coding ninja so I\nwill hand it over to them um coding\nninja team you could take it over for\nfurther\nquestions hey hi thank you so much for\nsuch an insightful session and with that\nI can see a lot of questions around K\nNinja's job boot camp and for for that\nwe have senior program expert from our\nteam and he will take over and will\nexplain how this uh you know coding\nninas job boot camp in data analytics\ncan be ideal Road for you so just 5 to\n10 minutes whoever wants to understand\nabout this know more about this they can\nstay and uh uh can keep dropping their\nquestions in chat box because we will be\ncatering to them uh by the end of the uh\nyou\nknow 5 10 minutes within more five more\nminutes I guess yeah K now over to\nyou yeah thank you thank you so much so\nI would like to thank the mentor for\nsuch an insightful session and hi\neveryone so my name is Karan and I am\nthe senior program expert from job boot"

    "well and what did not work well so uh",
    "one thing I would want to uh share is",
    "that",
    "uh this is just the best practices and",
    "it is not a short short method to crack",
    "the uh interview at data like as a data",
    "analyst in Microsoft uh because every",
    "team might have their own uh set of uh",
    "requirements or problem to solve So",
    "based on that they would put different",
    "type of rounds and different type of",
    "problems challenges that you have to",
    "solve uh using these",
    "uh in this job right so based on that",
    "you will have different rounds or",
    "different way that they would check your",
    "skills okay so depends on managers",
    "depends on team as well like um if they",
    "can be a team of 30 members they are",
    "trying to fit you in and you need to",
    "know how to work with those people there",
    "can be remote settings there can be",
    "people who are working with clients",
    "offshore so all of these things",
    "situations would occur and based on that",
    "different situations will be there and",
    "uh there'll be different way of gauging",
    "um a candidate and this is something",

    "that I know in my network so that's what",
    "I'm sharing over here okay",
    "um so uh firstly is what it is like to",
    "work as a data analyst at Microsoft is",
    "like it's a definitely fascinating role",

    "simple data said it can be very complex",
    "one right so all of this is done to",
    "extract meaningful insights um you would",
    "be helping data scientists program",
    "managers the data managers you would be",
    "helping uh engineering people uh it",
    "could be anyone you could be helping",
    "with these data analysis business or",
    "analyst or there many um more",
    "opportunities that you get as a data",
    "analyst at Microsoft to um help people",
    "and collaborate with them so uh it's all",
    "about you know blending analytical",
    "skills with the Microsoft robus tools",
    "and platforms that's available generally",
    "it's Microsoft tools and platforms if",

    "your team's work or your individual work",
    "uh a product can be shipped or stoed as",
    "so that's how uh it can go Global",
    "it cannot go Global so data analysis can",
    "play a big role um again how how much",
    "data from where you're getting the data",
    "also plays a a big role so uh",
    "proficiency uh matters a lot and being",
    "proficient in performing data analysis",
    "and proposing solution to enhance",
    "processes and performance uh while you",
    "identify the areas for improvement using",

    "right if you if you have some background",
    "knowledge then you you can solve it",
    "easily or you might if you don't have",
    "that knowledge then you might end up",
    "being in uh a place where you're not",
    "having any knowledge on how to solve",
    "right so it's better to have more and",
    "more experiences and more and more",
    "learning",
    "at Microsoft it's generally told that",
    "it's a continuous learning thing and not",
    "only Microsoft but I think it's it's in",

    "unique problems so you are solving those",

    "however we can just move on and see okay",

    "was that if you are trying to apply at",
    "these companies then you need to make",

    "based on that you might find different",
    "titles these are few titles that you",

    "also",
    "um then you have particularly financial",
    "analysis internship opportunities and",
    "there are times right now where",

    "these responsibilities are there so if",
    "these things fascinates you these things",
    "are something that you like then I would",
    "suggest that you go for uh this job role",
    "if you don't have the interest uh it's",
    "difficult to do good in the interview as",
    "well right and uh you will not",
    "understand few terms if and then the job",
    "would become difficult basic thing right",
    "so uh these are few responsibilities",
    "that you need to take care and it's",
    "crucial for a data analyst role in",
    "various",
    "organizations so uh it's you need to",
    "take care of these and if it's there",
    "then try to include these in your",
    "resume so how you can tailor your resume",
    "to get shortlisted at the top companies",
    "is like you have to firstly keep it very",
    "simple and easy to read because uh",
    "frankly nobody would really spend time",
    "on figuring out how to read that resume",
    "um I have also heard that uh the resum",
    "get scanned within 20 seconds also so",
    "how much you can cover in that 20",
    "seconds so try to keep it simple and",
    "easy um you can provide few links to a",
    "few fancy things be powerbi report or",
    "presentations or all of those things and",
    "keep it public if you're trying to",
    "provide those links if you are providing",
    "links which are having a uh requests",
    "permissions and all of that then",
    "obviously it's not a good experience so",
    "if you want to do something fancy",
    "provide links in your resume that might",
    "really if they are interested then they",
    "would click on the link and uh get know",
    "more about those fancy things in your",
    "resume so firstly keep it simple and uh",
    "easy to read or try to avoid as fancy",
    "things as possible be like you providing",
    "direct data and you don't need to",
    "fancify it then be concise and to the",
    "point exactly what you're trying uh",
    "achieve through that",
    "resume put that like you have done a lot",
    "of courses but again whatever is",
    "relevant to that particular job try to",
    "put that and you can put extra maybe but",
    "U if your resume is becoming a bit",
    "longer just try to keep it concise and",
    "to the point try to use action verbs uh",
    "start each bullet point with a strong",
    "action verb such as developed managed",
    "LED implemented and all of that so um",
    "try to write from an employer's point of",
    "view um because uh if suppose you were",
    "an employer and you were looking at the",
    "resume so how would it look like and",
    "what you are looking for or you tried it",
    "in that form that increases your chances",
    "um and um try to highlight relevant",
    "skills and experiences of qu ify your",
    "achievements showcase your education",
    "certifications courses certifications",
    "and courses play a big role sometimes",
    "because a lot of people just graduate in",
    "um apply but how can you differentiate",
    "yourself as having courses and",
    "certificates that shows that you're",
    "enthusiastic and if you're coming from a",
    "different background and if you want to",
    "apply for that particular job and if",
    "you're having a certification that means",
    "you're showing an inclination towards",
    "that particular role so it is a good uh",
    "thing that if you're applying courses",
    "and certification then you're putting it",
    "in your resume try to use a tools for",
    "initial screening um and before that you",
    "can also try to have a mentor who can go",
    "through your resume you can uh have like",
    "AI tools as well uh and you can have",
    "someone uh ge your resume is it looking",
    "good bad and uh what problems they are",
    "facing on that um then how would you",
    "showcase your skills in a smart way is",
    "try to uh show the transferable skill if",
    "you're coming from a non Tech background",
    "or you're not coming from a data analyst",
    "background try to highlight those",
    "transferable skills more than um any",
    "other skill uh try to incorporate a",
    "skills section use action oriented",
    "language and um show continuous learning",
    "and certifications if you are having",
    "some Gap or if uh you want to show that",
    "you are uh going towards that uh",
    "particular direction",
    "so um second I lost up track this one is that we were talking",
    "about your how to show your skills if",
    "possible try to create a resum website",
    "of yourself portfolio and uh data R",
    "story there are so many things that",
    "that's there link it try not to have a",
    "login or request option on that keep it",
    "public uh and uh so that they can just",
    "click on it and get through and um uh",
    "that can really be helpful U then try to",
    "use some resume",
    "passing tools like these tools will help",
    "you to extract and um standardize your",
    "data from your resume",
    "and these can ensure that your resume is",
    "formatted correctly and includes all the",
    "relevant information so it it basically",
    "makes easier for um the the recruiters",
    "to access your",
    "skills um so how can you identify the",
    "transferable skills is that uh these are",
    "few skills that's needed for an",
    "analytics background which is uh you",
    "need to have the analytical skills",
    "research project management attention to",
    "detail so all of these things if you're",
    "including it's adding all the plus",
    "points to your um analytical role",
    "and how you can highlight them uh is",
    "something that you need to uh discuss it",
    "with your peers or your uh even research",
    "we can have a Course Mentor obviously so",
    "uh these are few things that that if you",
    "are trying to get it included in the",
    "resume and uh some real world projects",
    "and case studies that I have included is",
    "I think these are something which is um",
    "not so common but you can try if you are",
    "having these real world projects and",
    "case studies out of your job if you're",
    "already having a job then try to include",
    "those projected case studies uh from",
    "uh your job and you can see that few",
    "projects are like sentimental analysis",
    "it's um quite in a trend these days then",
    "Smart City traffic management analytics",
    "we are seeing that uh there are cities",
    "which are going AI City nowadays so",
    "before that you need to have a lot of",
    "things in place if you want to call a",
    "city AI City your imagination goes like",
    "everything is perfect over there in AI",
    "City",
    "so we need to solve few things and their",
    "analyticals play a big role and a lot of",
    "problems are still not solved over there",
    "so it's good if you try to spend some",
    "time on how you can make those projects",
    "so these projects can be a big win for",
    "you guys if you really have solved some",
    "real time problems not just copy pasted",
    "from internet so how you can get part",
    "from a big crowd is that you need to",
    "solve some problems by yourself real",
    "time problems um and not just copy paste",
    "from internet okay then um before uh",
    "moving on to things like how you can um",
    "like put some things on your resume that",
    "can beat the application tracking",
    "systems um I would like to say that if",
    "you have any questions regarding the uh",
    "job boot camp or uh like how you can",
    "form a road map towards uh becoming a",
    "data analyst and uh if you want to talk",
    "to me mentors like me and um how you can",
    "get more guidance on all of these things",
    "because sometimes people from industry",
    "can give you real time um uh in insights",
    "on how you can make or make your resume",
    "better so for that we have created a",
    "form um like Gooding ninja is providing",
    "a form to us and you can fill th those",
    "forms and they can reach out to you or",
    "you can put some questions out there",
    "where uh uh they will reach out to you",
    "if uh they want to uh like address those",
    "questions so I would like to ask coding",
    "ners team to share that form with you",
    "guys this can be helpful to you guys to",
    "get some kind of mentoring um and we",
    "will also get to know what kind of",
    "questions are there out there for you",
    "guys to address it in our next uh",
    "section as well so um coding ninja",
    "stream if you could share that form with",
    "the",
    "audience in the",
    "chat",
    "it is already shared uh by uh",
    "the coding ninjas team take one or two",
    "minutes to fulfill this form here you",
    "can also get more information on how you",
    "can apply to particular job sometimes uh",
    "you need help on what to write in the",
    "cover letter you have a lot of things",
    "but uh you can't really get into or that",
    "particular uh job so coding njas have a",
    "lot of team from different companies and",
    "they have accumulated their own data on",
    "how application processes can work and",
    "they provide you some",
    "expertise um so you can fill those forms",
    "and uh they can help you in the guidance",
    "and give you comprehensive training",
    "offers and things like that so take one",
    "two minutes and then we will continue",
    "with",
    "this so the uh",
    "form link is shared",
    "again so take your time and fill that",
    "form meanwhile I will just continue with",
    "the PPT and uh see if you could connect",
    "it's a good opportunity to connect with",
    "the mentors and uh many other uh",
    "resources available with uh coding",
    "ninjas and Noy so try to fill that form",
    "and see if you can reach out to them all",
    "right so how you can um beat the uh",
    "application tracking system first of all",
    "people who don't know application",
    "tracking system nowadays A lot of people",
    "are using application tracking system to",
    "filter out a lot of resumes since a lot",
    "of resumes are coming which might not be",
    "worthy for the job uh so they have built",
    "a tracking system it's a software which",
    "would check for basic things like uh it",
    "it checks for relevant information such",
    "as your contact details work experiences",
    "education and skills keyword matching",
    "and some um basically it's trying to um",
    "check if you are relevant to that job uh",
    "sometimes people might apply",
    "to data analytics job but give a resume",
    "of a chef so that's completely",
    "irrelevant and it's not a point of",
    "recruiter should not go through all of",
    "those things so it's saving time so",
    "that's ATS and how you can avoid basic",
    "things that ATS is doing that you can uh",
    "put it in your resume and avoid uh",
    "getting rejected at the ATS level right",
    "so uh check out if there are some",
    "abbreviations related to the job try to",
    "expand them and try",
    "to put it into parenthesis the full form",
    "of the ab",
    "then you should try to Avid some keyword",
    "stuffing you know that these",
    "keywords are important but don't overdo",
    "it because um it's definitely important",
    "to in include the keywords but if you're",
    "sort of um like overloading it and",
    "stuffing it it looks unnatural and ATS",
    "can also flag that as well like what if",
    "somebody is just trying to copy paste",
    "the entire job description in the resume",
    "and sending it it doesn't mean that s",
    "will pass that ATS will simply reject",
    "that also so uh you need to be take care",
    "you need to be taking care of that as",
    "well try to take care of the spellings",
    "in the grammars because um if you're",
    "applying for artificial intelligence job",
    "and intelligent spelling is wrong or",
    "artificial spelling is wrong you might",
    "lose that job because of just the",
    "spelling and grammar so uh take care of",
    "that keep checking your resume again and",
    "again uh and try to use Simple layout",
    "avoid complex formatting and if there's",
    "missing contact information how are the",
    "people going to contact you so um there",
    "are few things that I have covered on",
    "how to make your resume worth getting",
    "selected for",
    "interview or right uh and once you are",
    "selected you need to have some story as",
    "well to your resume so make sure if you",
    "have some story to your resume U then",
    "that would increase your chances of like",
    "okay you have some cognitive thinking",
    "that you can make your resume in a a",
    "data driven style or you already know",
    "how to put things together or cohesive",
    "manner so it's it can be depicted",
    "through your resume and uh how you can",
    "do that is you can have a story to tell",
    "through your resume that you can tell",
    "when you are asked about me section or",
    "uh run through your resume so you can um",
    "tell it in a story form uh try to put it",
    "in a visual form if possible and share",
    "the link in the resume or you can",
    "present it while interview and always",
    "try to focus on impact uh so when you're",
    "giving your basic first round uh to what",
    "exactly you bringing to the table you",
    "can put these things and have more",
    "confidence when you are asked about",
    "about me or run through your resume",
    "these things are something which is uh",
    "people know but people uh try to",
    "hesitate or they get nervous at these",
    "point and maybe mess up also and they",
    "might also think that okay if the uh",
    "recruiter is already having my resume",
    "then why should I run through it uh this",
    "is something that you can put forward",
    "and you can make yourself stand out",
    "right so instead of just going through",
    "basic a thing of education and this and",
    "that you're just crafting a story out of",
    "that so you can have a data driven story",
    "and this is one example that I'm trying",
    "to project here where you can have the",
    "introduction how you did the data",
    "collection analysis results",
    "implementation what was the impact and",
    "concluded with you should have a",
    "conclusion to the story so you can",
    "include all of these things uh uh",
    "included in your resume and in your",
    "first uh question that you put in as in",
    "like explain about your job or the basic",
    "questions that you",
    "get um sorry that's um that's coming",
    "from my mobile so um this is one uh",
    "example coming from uh one of the",
    "resumes that I Tred to make where uh you",
    "can say that hey I'm a data analytics",
    "specialist with five years of experience",
    "you're basically putting your",
    "professional summary then you're",
    "summarizing your work experience what",
    "projects what skills you applied and",
    "what was the impact of it uh if you try",
    "to put those things in your resume in",
    "this way and you try to put that and in",
    "the top most section the people if they",
    "are trying to scan your resume the first",
    "lines they would scan and they would see",
    "there's some story to it and they",
    "would understand okay these skills are",
    "required for this project and",
    "uh so that's how they they would create",
    "a cohesive thing and this would slightly",
    "make your resum better and Polished one",
    "um few resum mistakes that can sabotage",
    "your chances like U having spelling",
    "grammar I think this one I can skip",
    "um so few things that you need to uh",
    "take care when you are trying to to",
    "prepare for Microsoft interviews is",
    "resarch the company stay updated with",
    "the latest news uh because there might",
    "be questions and some problems might",
    "come into uh your plate when uh",
    "interview is going on because they",
    "really have that problem and it's coming",
    "from the recent uh things like if you",
    "would say uh Microsoft have announced",
    "the maybe co-pilot going really big or",
    "even Google is trying to achieve uh",
    "something through but there are some",
    "problems that they are facing you can be",
    "someone who's solving that right or you",
    "have some Vision to solve that problem",
    "so that's how the research in the",
    "company uh takes comes into the picture",
    "and you can put that you try to include",
    "that when you're trying to show your",
    "real time projects or research or",
    "anything of that so try to include that",
    "when interviewer ask you question so um",
    "one very important thing is this",
    "research a job as well if you are",
    "applying for a job that means you're",
    "trying to solve a problem at a company",
    "so I generally feel that if there is a a",
    "job opening then they're definitely",
    "trying to solve a problem so what",
    "problem are they trying to solve this or",
    "you can try to understand and what",
    "Solutions are you offering that you can",
    "offer through this then you should need",
    "to understand the interview process",
    "sometimes so it is available in the",
    "market sometimes you can ask your HR you",
    "can ask the interviewer themselves like",
    "what would be the process what are the",
    "rounds and things like that the it can",
    "be same as what they telling or they can",
    "it can be something more uh depending on",
    "how they are assessing you try to do",
    "practice uh um some virtual interviews",
    "with your mentors peers or use some",
    "tools um courses all of those things so",
    "it becomes necessary when you're not",
    "doing it for the first time in the first",
    "time you might make some glitches that",
    "you can avoid when you do some practices",
    "and prepare for technical interviews",
    "there are lot of experiences shared",
    "about technical interviews so prepare",
    "for those and if you're applying for a",
    "technical role make sure you know a lot",
    "of things because they can ask you any",
    "problem and if you are very um open and",
    "very uh true to what exactly",
    "uh you know is what they are looking for",
    "don't try to Bluff that you know these",
    "things and then uh in the interview they",
    "can basically judge you out that you",
    "don't know all of these things because",
    "think from the perspective that they",
    "have gone through a lot of resumes and",
    "also they can H because they are sitting",
    "at a very expertise level so they can",
    "understand if you're trying to fake it",
    "so I would say don't try to fake it and",
    "don't try to lie especially at these",
    "companies it may not work for you and",
    "you might not even get a feedback that",
    "hey you are lying or you faking it out",
    "so straight out say no further processes",
    "so try to get the expertise and then",
    "only attend these interviews there will",
    "be behavioral questions for that you can",
    "uh apply star framework which is a",
    "situation task action and result uh this",
    "is very common framework it's in",
    "Friendly these days and also good way to",
    "answer behavioral questions like what",
    "was the situation if there was a",
    "conflict between your team member how",
    "did you solve it and what actions did",
    "you take um you reached out to your",
    "manager you solved it by yourself you",
    "reached out to that person you KN it",
    "down and then it resolved came to a",
    "common Point all of these things you can",
    "tell and result what was it like okay",
    "you could work in Harmony and you treeve",
    "something through that within 10 days 5",
    "days whatever so uh try to put numbers",
    "as well over here in the results back",
    "what was it so those things can be of",
    "brownie points on uh if there are some",
    "problems that's already existing in the",
    "team every team would have some of the",
    "other problem and your behavioral",
    "questions would bring maybe new flavor",
    "to the team or or you might even blend",
    "in the team they looking for so this is",
    "completely luck based or even if you ask",
    "few questions to the uh recruiter that",
    "how is the team what you expecting from",
    "me as a team member then also you can",
    "get to know exactly what they are",
    "looking for uh you as a team member then",
    "um know your",
    "competencies um and what exactly is",
    "required in the job um it's the same as",
    "uh previous one that we have covered",
    "that is uh technical interviews if you",
    "have uh then how you're going to cover",
    "that the same way you you should know",
    "your competencies or if you can have",
    "some more competencies apart from",
    "technical like you have adaptability you",
    "have collaboration or you solve some",
    "customer problems stakeholders problems",
    "some problems that your manager were",
    "facing they were not able to solve but",
    "you solved it um eat the frog is some",
    "term that they use so those things if",
    "you have done in your job or in your",
    "universities then you can um put it over",
    "here be prepared to demonstrate these",
    "competencies through your past",
    "experiences um try to pull the",
    "interviewers that they can see these",
    "competencies as well but don't overdo",
    "don't waste their time if you're not",
    "looking for it sometimes they might be",
    "so it depends on how you're trying to",
    "gauge their body language as well and",
    "don't try to bore them so uh make sure",
    "that you're trying to put some",
    "interesting facts that can be",
    "interesting to them so if there might be",
    "few things that it might be not plugging",
    "them or at that time but you bring that",
    "up as your strength then that would be",
    "browny point to you that okay um these",
    "things that they can add to the team and",
    "it is a long du thing or a problem which",
    "is lying out there but it's not getting",
    "solved but you can solve so that can",
    "increase your chance ances of getting",
    "selected um and um like if you are not",
    "from uh the same city you can request",
    "for the",
    "accommodations uh if needed if you're",
    "having little problem then you can try",
    "to request for the accomodation and if",
    "you're a right candidate and uh all that",
    "all that thing you're bringing to the",
    "table uh then they would be lenient to",
    "give you the accommodation so it's good",
    "to ask if you want so that uh you see um",
    "you can get what you want to prepare",
    "good for your",
    "interview uh it it doesn't mean that",
    "you're asking them for accommodations in",
    "a hotel or anything of that sort but",
    "something like uh um if I'm trying to",
    "say that you're a woman and you want",
    "some online interview process or",
    "something of that sort maybe for some",
    "reason then you can try to say that hey",
    "uh I'm on so and so break and I would",
    "want an online interview so those things",
    "if possible you can ask basic things uh",
    "some small things that can make your",
    "interview process easy don't uh Forst",
    "them for those accommodations but if",
    "needed only ask them few interview",
    "rounds that would appear to you guys are",
    "these and these are few that I have",
    "observed so far and heard stories and",
    "have gone through few of them so these",
    "interview rounds are some things which",
    "are very common but there can be few",
    "more um but I cannot think of anything",
    "that might be missing over here but in",
    "case you guys think there's something",
    "missing do let us know that you have",
    "experienced some interview round apart",
    "from these uh at our fangs and Ms and",
    "all of those and we have not included",
    "let me know in chat uh so these are few",
    "interview rounds on initial screening",
    "would be done um there would be video",
    "call phone call with an HR Rec or the",
    "initial screen around and uh here they",
    "would assess your background experience",
    "interest in the role they might discuss",
    "your resume and relevant projects your",
    "expectations from the job all of those",
    "things and notice period all of those",
    "things might be asked here then there's",
    "something called cognitive assessments",
    "which are the test um which checks your",
    "um mental functions and ability uh for",
    "crucial tasks that might be there with",
    "them it involves basically the um",
    "analytical round the reasoning round the",
    "problem solving and uh your",
    "comprehension and all of that so it",
    "might be needed for few jobs uh it might",
    "not be needed as well so this is sort of",
    "an optional round uh but generally in",
    "analytical role you need some kind of",
    "skills uh that should be projected here",
    "as an analytical skill so it includes it",
    "can include aptitude test also aptitude",
    "test quantitative test all of those",
    "things come in these rounds and there's",
    "technical interview rounds which is",
    "highly related to the job they might ask",
    "you what things you have done they might",
    "ask you about the tools be prepared you",
    "can uh be asked many depth questions",
    "here in technical interview rounds and",
    "how you approach the problems uh for",
    "those particular technical problems uh",
    "so it can again vary from beginner level",
    "to advanced level as well so depending",
    "on what kind of job and what interviewer",
    "is looking for in the candidate they can",
    "um put these um question questions out",
    "there so you can expect questions like",
    "our difference between power and tblo",
    "explain Dax or how did you uh do some",
    "kind of",
    "analysis when such problem existed so",
    "this can also lead to scenario based",
    "questions where they would put you into",
    "a scenario and they would say that how",
    "are you going to address this scenario",
    "it shows your time management skill your",
    "your um approach to a problem your",
    "ability to solve a problem and what",
    "tools you know how you can you know any",
    "Frameworks and all of those things come",
    "in uh picture over here so some examples",
    "like you have uh some sales metrics data",
    "now create a dashboard showing monthly",
    "revenue or you want to show this data to",
    "the stakeholder how are you going to",
    "create the report sometimes you might",
    "have to create reports",
    "um like about 10 to 15 in a month as",
    "well uh for different stakeholders or",
    "you might have to create a new one or",
    "something of that sort so how you going",
    "to um address those issues at your job",
    "that will be assessed over here then um",
    "there'll be something like based on how",
    "you're solving your Solutions and",
    "everything they would ask questions like",
    "how can you handle data from multiple",
    "sources maybe you have solved the",
    "problem entirely what they were looking",
    "for or they might be thinking that okay",
    "you have a good approach but there are",
    "few more things that they need to add so",
    "they would add here that okay you want",
    "to handle data from multiple sources and",
    "how you can do that all of those things",
    "can be asked over here so be prepared",
    "when you are uh going for this then uh",
    "something similar would be Hands-On",
    "assessment where companies might provide",
    "you some links and some home uh like",
    "they would ask you to solve it in 24",
    "hours or uh they would give you some",
    "time period and put a Hands-On",
    "assessment and uh you need to solve that",
    "and give it to them um on a proper tool",
    "and everything so here again it can be",
    "creation of the reports or solving some",
    "SQL",
    "queries excuse me so those things can",
    "come over here again behavioral",
    "questions are something that I have",
    "covered already uh here something would",
    "be like how would you handle tight",
    "deadlines and are you more someone who",
    "works independently or you need some",
    "handholding uh sometimes they need",
    "collaborative so they want people to get",
    "hand holded sometimes they want people",
    "to be independent it depends on teams",
    "managers so uh it's on you also you can",
    "ask ask what kind of things they are",
    "expecting from you then managerial and",
    "Team interview is very important round",
    "and you will definitely have this round",
    "and uh one uh optional round can be",
    "domain specific questions like if you're",
    "applying for a a finance uh data",
    "analysis or you're trying to apply for a",
    "data applied sciences analytics role",
    "then um all of those things will have a",
    "particular domain specific questions uh",
    "those you need to be prepared for okay",
    "in the managerial round you would meet",
    "the hiring manager uh it is for sure",
    "that you would meet hiring manager in",
    "once in all your interview rounds and uh",
    "in this generally what is checked is do",
    "you uh fit in the team uh or not mostly",
    "and they would also see your experience",
    "what's your motivation and all of those",
    "things so",
    "with this I think we have covered almost",
    "every round of the interviews and we",
    "have four minutes left in this I would",
    "try to address as many questions and",
    "possible and um um I would also seek",
    "some questions if there's something for",
    "coding njas so moving on to our Q&A",
    "session um few questions that I'm",
    "getting from the chat as well um Sophia",
    "I don't know what previous slide you",
    "were looking at so I'm excluding that a",
    "b will CH gbt shorted resume can be",
    "caught or reject by",
    "ATS uh even if it is getting caught I",
    "think there's no harm if it is uh like",
    "chat GPT one why not but again I think",
    "we have seen one post recently where",
    "somebody have just copy pasted from chat",
    "GP where they have not included the",
    "experience but they have included",
    "something that chat gbt told here you",
    "can include the experience right so you",
    "need to customize obviously right you're",
    "applying for such big opportunity try to",
    "put in efforts is what I can say so",
    "there's no harm in using charb and AI",
    "tools but make sure you're using it with",
    "some intelligence in some",
    "wisdom um okay and nagas is telling",
    "learn statistics before practice the",
    "exploratory data analysis um yes basic",
    "one would be",
    "needed",
    "um I'm not able to find the Q&A session",
    "where oh okay the recording would be shared",
    "to us after the session uh it will be",
    "available on the portal so you can reach",
    "out from there does our resume have to",
    "go through ATS yes every resume even if",
    "the internal candidates are applying um",
    "through the portal that goes through ATS",
    "and our resum also get rejected if it's",
    "not following the ATS things",
    "so yes ATS uh",
    "will come into the",
    "picture I heard that there few things",
    "for voice breaking unble to hear I hope",
    "it was good and able to capture the",
    "information I did not read that um in",
    "the middle in my session but it was only",
    "in the beginning I guess not later so",
    "few more questions are there but mostly",
    "I feel is related",
    "to uh job boot Camp so I will hand it",
