  "text": "hi this is Jeff Dean welcome to\napplications of deep neural networks of\nWashington University in this video\nwe're going to look at how we can use\nganz to generate additional training\ndata for the latest on my a I course and\nprojects click subscribe in the bell\nnext to it to be notified of every new\nvideo Dan's have a wide array of uses\nbeyond just the face generation that you\noften see them use for they can\ndefinitely generate other types of\nimages but they can also work on tabular\ndata and really any sort of data where\nyou are attempting to have a neural\nnetwork that is generating data that\nshould be real or should or could be\nclassified as fake the key element to\nhaving something as again is having that\ndiscriminator that tells the difference\nin the generator that actually generates\nthe data another area that we are seeing\nganz use for a great deal is in the area\nof semi supervised training so let's\nfirst talk about what semi-supervised\ntraining actually is and see how again\ncan be used to implement this first\nlet's talk about supervised training and\nunsupervised training which you've\nprobably seen in previous machine\nlearning literature but just in case you\nhaven't supervised training is what\nwe've been doing up to this point I\nwould say probably the vast majority of\nthis class is in the area of supervised\nlearning this is where you have multiple\naxes in the case of tabular data or\ngrids and other things in the case of\nimage data but you have some sort of\ninput coming in which is the X and you\nknow what the correct Y's are you are\ngoing to train the model to produce\nthese Y's when you have these X's\nbecause later on you're going to have\nX's coming in where you don't know what\nthe Y is and that's where you want the\nneural network or other model to be able\nto give you some estimate as far as what\nthe Y value is going to actually be\nunsupervised training is where we have\nthe X's it could look just like this it\nwould work with image data tabular or\nreally just about anything\nbut there is no y we're letting the\nneural network or whatever\nmodel it is and you know typically by\nthe way use neural networks for\nunsupervised training this is usually\nthe area of things like k-means\nclustering and other things\nyour classic unsupervised training is\njust going to take the inputs and\ncluster them in such a way so that\nsimilar ones are together these could be\nsimilar images these could be similar\ninputs in tabular data a variety of\nthings semi supervised training it's\nactually much closer to supervised\ntraining I would say than unsupervised\nand this is where gams really shine and\nsemi-supervised training you have X's\njust like you have in these others but\nyou don't have a label or a Y for every\nsingle one of them you might have a\nsmall number of them by oh no means have\nthe complete data set label\ntraditionally what would be done is\nthese values that were not labeled would\nbe left out because they there was no\nway to feed them into traditional\nsupervised learning or you would train\nit on the ones that you did have Y's for\nwith classic back propagation or however\nyou were training that particular model\nthen you would create predictions Y\npredictions for all the missing values\nand then retrain the whole thing on the\npredictive values with the others in\npractice I never had a great deal of\nsuccess with that technique but there is\nsome theoretical basis for it with semi\nsupervised training and Ganz will see\nthat there's a way that we are able to\nactually make use of these now\nsemi-supervised training this does make\nsense from a biological standpoint if\nyou think about a child who is seeing\nall sorts of vehicles as they go about\ntheir daily lives with their parents or\nwhoever they're with and they're seeing\nall these vehicles as they pass on the\nstreet and they're not labeled nobody is\ntelling them even though that's a\nvehicle seeing just a barrage of images\nas they as they grow up they learn edges\nthey learn other sorts of things they\nlearn how to classify if something is on\ntop of something else just by observing\nthere's no particular labels then\neventually somebody says hey that's a\nthat's a bus that's that's a train\nthat's a bicycle using that that small\nhandful of labels that they're given\nwhen somebody actually tells them what\nthey're looking at or they verify it\nindependently\nthat is semi-supervised training because\nit is building on those years and years\nof having unlabeled data that they they\ndidn't know what they were looking at\nbut they knew they were looking at\nsomething and it just it gives them\nadditional reference that's exactly the\nsame thing with supervised training\nthese values even though we don't have\nwise\nthey're still valuable for the neural\nnetwork to be learning structure in this\ndata as it is learning to predict the\nones that we do actually in fact have\nthe wise heart so let's look at the\nstructure for this this is the structure\nof a normal image generating gang\nbaseline so to speak where they research\nstarted we saw this before but just to\nquickly review we have actual images\nthey go into a discriminator and we have\nthe generated images that the generator\nso the cyan pieces those are the two\nneural networks random seed values are\ncausing that generator to generate\nimages the discriminator is learning to\nbetter and better discriminate between\nactual and generated the generator is\nlearning to create better and better\nimages that fool the discriminate now\nonce this is all done you keep the\ngenerator because it generates images\nfor you and you likely throw away the\ndiscriminator it was just there for the\ngenerator to practice against will see\nthat this flips for semi-supervised\nlearning and semi-supervised learning we\ncare about the discriminator and not so\nmuch the generator we typically throw\nthe generator away this is how you would\ntrain a semi supervised classification\nneural network it's very very similar to\nthe diagram that we just looked at in\nthis case we're looking at how we would\ntrain it on tabular data it's a medical\nrecord the discriminator would learn to\ntell the difference between a fake\nmedical record or whatever the generator\nis generating this parts all the same as\nthe previous one as is as is this part\nthe difference is we're training it now\nto tell not just the difference between\nfake and real these are the real\nand this is this is fake we're teaching\nit to learn classes so there's four\ndifferent classes of say medical record\nthat we're looking at maybe four\ndifferent health levels we're teaching\nit as a classification neural network to\nclassify between five things the four\nclasses that were actually interested in\nand is it a fake once we're done\ntraining the whole thing we now have\nthis discriminator that can tell the\ndifference between fake and what the\nwhat the classes are we also have the\ngenerator that is able to generate these\nfake medical records but we can then\nthrow away the generator and we'll use\nthe discriminator really truly as our\nactual neural network now for the\nmedical records where we don't have the\nY so we're missing this we still feed\nthose in it's just now we're evaluating\nit not based on if it classified it\ncorrectly but just if it knew the\ndifference between fake and real the\nstreet house view data set is a image\ndata set that is often used to\ndemonstrate semi-supervised game\nlearning and I have a link to a curious\nexample external to this class that\ndemonstrates this if you're interested\nin this sort of technology but what this\ndoes is you have data on these addresses\nfrom images that were taken on the sides\nof buildings and not all of those are\nlabeled or you simulate them not all\nbeing labeled and you see that the Gann\nis capable of learning to classify these\n10-digit types even though it doesn't\nhave labels on each of those now if you\nwant to do the same thing for regression\nit becomes very similar you have two\noutputs so you have a multi output\nneural network one is the actual\nregression value that you're trying to\ntrain it on and the other is the\nprobability that it's a fake record\nbeing generated now these I'm doing\ntabular as just the example again these\ncould be medical records and perhaps the\nregression output would be a health\nlevel or maybe a guess at how old the\npatient is or some other value perhaps\nif they have a current disease or not a\nprediction so it's it's doing the same\ntwo things when you feed an medical\nrecords where we don't know the Y output\nthen we want to see that this regression\non the fake record when we're feeding in\nvalues where we have the medical record\nwhere you don't have the Y we just want\nto make sure that the probability that\nthe fake record is fairly high and\nthat's built into the training we don't\nso much care about what its regressing\non or what the Russian output is for\nones where we do have it we're\npenalizing it based on how close or how\nfar away it was from the expected Y from\nthis and just like the classification\none when we're all done with this we\nthrow away the generator in the\ndiscriminator becomes the\nsemi-supervised neural network that was\ntrained on this now if you want to go\nfurther with this semi-supervised\nlearning technique i've given you a\ncouple of lengths of articles that i\nfound useful for this there is a link to\nthe actual house data set that's a\npretty interesting data set to look at\nit has all those house numbers above you\ncan deal with in several ways you can\ndeal with classifying the individual\ndigits they give you the bounding\nrectangles around the digits they also\ngive you just the bounding rectangle of\nthe entire set of digits if you want to\nso you can be classifying digits or you\ncan be classifying the entire address it\njust depends on how you want to set up\nthe problem the examples that I give you\nhere we're using individual digits this\nis the original paper that first started\nlooking at this unsupervised\nrepresentation learning with deep\nconvolutional generative Gass general\ngenerative adversarial Network I have a\nlink to this paper in the module thank\nyou for watching this video in the next\nvideo we're going to take a look at some\nof the most cutting-edge and current\nresearch into Ganz it's a very active\narea of research this content change is\noften so subscribe to the channel to\nstay akha date on this course and other\ntopics and artificial intelligence\n",
