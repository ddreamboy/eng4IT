  "text": "today we're going to talk about some\ncyber security skills I believe everyone\nshould have first thing on the list is\ngoing to be ioc's or indicators of\ncompromise this means identifying what\nexactly is the source of a Cyber attack\nit could be a website like in this case\na file on your computer as with all of\nmy other videos we're going to go\nthrough this with a real example so this\nis actually a malware website that we're\njust going to visit but hey how do I\nknow if this is malware at that brings\nus to the second cyber security skill\nand that is going to be investigation\nthe ability to perform research and dig\nout the details behind something let's\nsay you visit this website because a\nfriend on Discord sent you this link\nfirst the website seems overly\nsimplistic and we're going to look a\nlittle bit deeper in The Code by just\npressing F12 and if we expand the head\nas you can see we've got the description\nwe've got reference to GitHub and we've\nalso got some references to Discord but\nnot everyone can understand it HTML but\nwhat you can do is you can always use\nwebsites like scam advisor and simply\nlook up whatever website you're visiting\nso let's say we wanted to do a deeper\ndive into planis therapy.org it has a\ntrust score of 56 so if we scroll down\nit's got a valid SSL certificate which\nwe can also check from here with the\nnice lock but it's also got a paid\nservice to hide its identity now this is\nnot uncommon a lot of websites do that\nbut it also doesn't have many visitors\nand it's only been registered very\nrecently now this is all data that's\npublicly available through the Ian\nrecord now on the contrary if we search\nfor a website like the PCC\nchannel.com you're going to see\ninstantly that we have a trust score of\n100 so you know you can safely visit us\nnext against our judgment we're actually\ngoing to download the malware which\nbrings us to malware analysis there was\na time when malware analysis was really\ndifficult and you would need an expert\nin bite code Assembly Language to do it\nbut that has changed so once we extract\nthis belligerent exe put it on our\ndesktop we can analyze it quite easily\nby simply going to a site like hybrid\nanalysis picking an operating system\nthat we're running and generate a public\nreport and within a few seconds we get a\nverdict that this is indeed malicious\nnow you could use a variety of services\nincluding vars total but as you can see\nit's not always a reliable indicator of\nwhether or not a fall is malicious if\nyou're just Rel on the detections but\nyou could also skip the online services\nand use something like P Studio drag and\ndrop the file there and look for things\nin red basically things like the program\nname being Windows update assistant an\ninvalid certificate and an overlay on\nthe exe might be suspicious the next\nskill I'm going to talk about is\nforensics which is the ability to take a\ndeeper look and what's happening inside\na system you don't have to use Advanced\ntools like volatility but everyone can\ndownload Microsoft's CIS internal Suite\nfrom CIS internal.com and learn to use a\ncouple of basic tools like process\nExplorer and TCP view process Explorer\nis going to show you everything that's\nexecuting on your system all of the\nprocesses all of the dlls everything\nthat's loaded along with scan results\nand vars total if you select it in\noptions TCP view on the other hand is\ngoing to show you every connection that\nyour computer is making to a remote\naddress and using the first skill\ninvestigation you can actually figure\nout what these addresses are so for\ninstance if we now run this file that we\ngot from the website and it's running\nall of these uh different command line\ntools and we can see that this\nparticular process that we just launched\nhas established a connection with this\nIP address it's not really showing us\nany UI but it's connecting and\ncommunicating with a remote address\nwhich suggests some kind of Trojan\nBehavior similarly this particular\nprocess is loading a lot of DLS some of\nwhich are being detected views like this\ncan look quite intimidating to the\naverage user but you have to remember\nthis is all graphic user interface\neverything is written so you can read\nthe process name you can read the\ndescription and over time you're going\nto familiarize yourself with what runs\non your system by default so that when\nyou run something new you're going to be\nable to spot it instantly as time goes\non I think the basic skills of being\nable to investigate and verify what\nyou're looking at going to be more and\nmore important now I hope you found this\nvideo helpful please like and share it\nif you did now this video is sponsored\nby one of my favorite cyber security\ntools which is malware bites a\nfull-fledged lightweight antivirus\nprogram that has routinely demonstrated\ngood detection capabilities in our tests\nas well as massively improved their UI\nrecently and if we look at settings it\nhas everything from ransomware and\nexploit protection to the ability to\nblock pentesting attempts many of you\nmay have heard of malware bites as a\nsecond opinion scanner something you use\nto remove malware if your system is\ninfected but the brand new malware bites\nis actually a full-on AV replacement and\nstops malware in real time they recently\nupdated their user interface as you can\nsee it looks very slick and dark mode\nwe've done independent tests of this in\nthe past which you can find on the\nchannel and they've shown consistent\nImprovement in the last few years so\nshow them some love check them out using\nthe link in description thank you all so\nmuch for watching this is Leo from the\nPC security Channel and as always stay\ninformed stay\nsecure\nfor\n",
