excited to welcome you to the third\nsession of our Azure AI engineer\nassociate boot camp before we begin I\nhave some exciting news today we will be\nannouncing the winners of the best blog\nOra page for the previous session so\nstay tuned until the end to find out who\nhas\nwon this\nsession this session is all about\ncreating computer vision Solutions with\na AI Vision this will give you a deep\ndive into how you can leverage a your AI\nVision to build intelligent applications\nthat process and analyze visual data\nthank you all for joining us and let's\nget ready for another another enriching\nexperience we are privileged to have\naditta Pand with us today Aditya is a\ncloud products associate advis Labs with\na strong background in Cloud\nTechnologies with AI his expertise will\nhelp us navigate the exciting world of\ncomputer vision showing us how to\nimplement AI Vision capabilities in our\nSolutions without further Ado let me\nhand it over to adya over to you\nsir thank you hes thank you so much and\nuh good morning to each and everyone I\nknow it's 12: PM but I think on a\nweekend it is still a morning for\neverybody so good morning each and\neverybody uh thank you so much for\njoining in today's session and uh I\ndon't think on a weekend this is a uh\nthere can be a better start of the\nweekend than organizing the session and\nlearning something new right so I think\nweekend should be uh you know should be\nfor learning something new right so\ntoday uh we will be learning a lot of\nnew things in this session and uh the\nmain thing in this session would be to\ncreating computer vision Solutions with\naure AI vision and if I give give you my\nmy brief introduction then uh as hes has\nalready uh given beautiful introduction\nand I thank thank V hes for this so if I\ntalk about myself my name is adya Pand\nand I'm A Cloud products associate at\nWiz laabs I have been doing handson on\nAzure for past three years and I have\ngained a very good experience on\nMicrosoft asure and today I'll be\nshowing you how we can integrate\ndifferent services with computer vision\nor aure AI Vision so before uh coming to\nthe uh PPT presentation and starting the\nsession I would like to tell each and\neverybody of you those who are attending\nthis session I will be talking about\nmany use cases in today's session right\nand whenever I give you some use cases\nafter my use cases is it will be you who\nwill be just uh you know dropping one of\nthe use cases which will come to your\nmind that how what else can be done what\nelse can be uh the feature of that\nservice what else can be uh analyzed\nthrough that service so you will be also\ndropping some of the use cases in the\ncomment section and I would like to see\nthat now let's get started with the\nsession uh please let me know if my\nscreen is visible to everybody\nyes it is visible okay so I've given you\nmy brief introduction uh I am a cloud\nproducts associate Adlabs and today\nwe'll be talking about creating computer\nvision Solutions with aure AI Vision\nright so just moving to the introduction\nof computer vision and AI first before\ngoing to Azure AI Vision so if I talk\nabout computer vision what what exactly\na computer vision is so with the name\nitself you would be able to to\nunderstand what exactly the meaning of\nthis name computer Visions means there\nis a computer there's a system which is\nacting as a vision for you\nright so computer vision is basically a\nbranch of artificial intelligence right\nwhich deals with uh uh different kind of\nyou know anal analyzing different kind\nof images and videos and uh you know\ndeciding uh\nthe based on the visual inputs it will\ndecide you it will give you some uh you\nknow decisions like what is there what\nis not there what should be the next\nstep what should not be the next step\nright and if I talk about AI using AI in\ncomputer vision so AI actually helps\nwith you know machine learning and deep\nlearning to train the computer vision\nsystem every day after every set of data\nright as because is a cloud-based model\nand it works on machine learning and\ndeep learning\nit's gives uh it it get trained every\ntime whenever uh there is a feed of data\ngiven to the computer vision it will get\ntrained to you know to reach the\naccuracy level level and if you talk\nabout the real world application for\ncomputer vision is uh we can you know\nnow I'm talking about applications I'll\nbe talking about four applications here\nand the fifth application you will be\ndropping in the comments okay so the\nfirst application can be\nHealthcare right how computer vision can\nbe beneficial to Healthcare Systems in\nhealthcare you see uh you know patients\ndo x-rays patients do city scan MRIs\nright so computer vision as per a\npre-trained model or the model given\nmodel trained by you it can analyze the\nuh you know anomalies in the x-rays or\ncity scan it can give you the solution\nor it can tell you where is the problem\nin that x-ray right so this is\nHealthcare System can use it another\nreal word application would be retail\nokay how this can be used in retail we\ncan use this retail as a product\nrecognition system right you can just\nyou know scan a product or give a\nproduct to the computer vision it will\ngive you the details of the product it\nwill it will tell you all the\napplications all the benefits all the\nlimitations of that product right\nanother thing is security and\nsurveillance right so so how let's say\nlet's take an example for this let's say\nyou run a supermarket okay and you are\nthe owner of that market and every day\nthousands of people are visiting your\nstore right now what will happen it it\nwill get difficult for you to manage\nthousands of crowd uh every day in your\nstore because you know uh you have a\nlimited space in your store and people\nare in a large number now what you can\ndo you can set up a computer vision in\nyour store to check the threats and\nsecurity uh issues in your store let's\nsay let's take another example let's say\nuh one day there is a person coming in\nyour store and he has surpassed the\nsecurity checks okay uh he has crossed\nthe security security security check and\nyour guard could not identify that that\nthis person is uh having a knife in his\npocket now at a moment that person is\nyou know taking that knife from his\npocket now what will happen your\ncomputer vision system will identify\nthat okay this person is holding a knife\nand you have trained your computer\nvision in such a way that whenever you\nsee any let's say any harmful uh objects\nin your video right it will just turn on\nthe siren or it will give you a message\nthat there is a knife there there is a\nperson who is holding a knife in in your\nSupermarket or it will then it will turn\nthe sil uh siren on right so this is how\nyou can increase the security so this is\none of the examples I have given you can\nyou know think on yourself how this can\nbe uh implemented in many ways for the\nsecurity and uh\nsurveillance thing now another thing is\nautonomous vehicles how this can be\nimplemented in autonomous vehicles is uh\nlet's say you are going uh somewhere uh\nin your vehicle and there is person\nstanding on the road so now your\ncomputer vision system will identify\nthat is a person standing on the road\nand it will you know start applying\nbrakes automatically or let's say you\nhave missed a road sign there is a road\nsign on the road side and you have\nmissed that but your computer version\nsystem is analyzing each and everything\nwhenever you are traveling through your\ncar in your car right and whenever there\nis any sign comes on the road side it\nwill give you a message that there is a\nroad sign and it will also tell you this\nroad sign is for what on that uh\ndecision or on that input given by the\ncomputer vision to you you can identify\nor you can decide what action you are\ngoing to take right so this is a brief\nintroduction of computer vision and AI\nso computer vision is a branch of AI\nright computer vision is I I won't say\nthat this is directly related to\nMicrosoft Azure but it is a branch of AI\nwhich is implemented by Microsoft Azure\nand that is called as azure AI Vision\nright under Azure AI Vision we will be\nlearning about computer vision and uh\ncustom Vision okay now let's move into\nthe next slide and we'll have some brief\nintroduction of isure AI Vision I've\nalready told you so this is a\ncloud-based service that helps uh build\nand deploy computer vision application\nright it will analyze your image it can\nyou know extract information from images\nit can extract information from your\ndocuments right it can also extract\ninformation from your uh realtime videos\nit can process videos and extract\ninformation from that as well right what\ncan be the key cap key capabilities of\nazure AI vision is it will do the image\nclassification right it can extract\ninformation from images and not only one\ninformation but different kind of\ninformation it can give you the metadata\nfor your image right it will also detect\nuh the objects present in the image it\nwill also extract the text from your\nimages or videos okay how Industries can\nuse azurea Vision right so Industries\ncan use in manufacturing let's say\nquality control and finance can use uh\nas a document processing uh solution for\nfor their uh Financial let's say banks\nare there right uh you have a uh\nphysical document you have a hard copy\nwhich is written by you and not typed on\nyour system right so even there is a\ndocument which is written by you it can\nhelp you extract data from that right so\nthis is how how beautiful this system\nis in a smart cities uh it can be useful\nfor traffic monitoring it can tell you\nuh where is the traffic right at what\nplace traffic is more at what what place\ntraffic is less so that you can you know\ndivert from the uh more traffic area to\nthe less traffic area right so this is\nhow asure AI vision is helpful to you\nknow give solutions to your systems or\nto your use cases uh in different\nscenarios now let's moving to the uh\nanother point where we will be talking\nabout the traditional approaches and uh\nyou know advantage of advantages of the\nmodern approach of Aid driven\nVision So In traditional approaches\napproaches what used to happen was you\nknow uh everything was hardcoded right\nthe traditional methods used to rely on\nuh rule based system so what is Rule\nbased system is you have to write rules\nhard code rules for each and everything\nlet's say for example you want to\nanalyze edges in an image to analyze\nedges in an image you need to hard code\nthat right so for everything there is\nhard code required right and you know in\nAI driven Vision we use machine learning\nright through machine learning every day\nyour your data set your model gets\ntrained and you know it is just\napproaching towards accuracy and but in\ntraditional method it is very difficult\nto you\nknow uh reach to that level of\naccuracy even uh in traditional methods\nit is very difficult to you know uh to\napply this uh traditional method AI\ndriven Vision I mean uh the traditional\nmethod to your systems because it\nactually gets difficult and sometime\nwhat happens is uh in traditional method\nit gets difficult to identify images\nwhat kind of images let's say there are\ntwo images which are overlapping now\nyour\ntraditional uh system will get will find\nit difficult to identify the images when\ntwo images are overlapping another\nanother example where traditional\nsystems can fail or can give you less\naccuracy is in low light\nconditions right in low light conditions\nif you have not trained your if you have\nnot hardcoded your traditional methods\nproperly with with the atmost accuracy\nthen it is not going to give you\naccurate uh outputs in low light\nconditions right but this is not the\ncase in AI driven Vision the first thing\nuh you need you don't need to take care\nof storage as it is on cloud you just\nneed to give data set whatever size of\ndata set you have you can just give it\nto uh this uh system AI driven vision\nand it will just keep on training from\nthe data sets every day whenever it uh\nit has an encounter with data okay it\ngets trained automatically through\nmachine learning and deep learning right\nand it will reach to the accuracy level\nso that's the flexibility AI driven\nVision gives you right and uh uh you\nknow uh it also improved the accuracy\nwith the large data sets that I already\ncovered and if we talk about the\nadvantages of azure AI Vision I've\nalready told you the advantage but here\nare few more advantages these are we can\neasily integrate this with other aure\nservices sorry we can easily integrate\nwith Azure uh Azure services that is uh\nlet's take an example uh you can use\nblob storage with your Azure AI Vision\nyou can use Azure functions you can use\nuse Azure logic apps with your Azure AI\nVision you know to just uh create a\nsystem or create a logic to to um\nmake it serverless right you can use\nyour functions to make it serverless\nright and these are also scalable and\nflexible because these are hosted on\ncloud and in uh Aid driven Visions they\nare pre-trained model on on most of the\ndata sets there are few use cases where\nyou know uh it's up to you where you\nwant your use cases to be identified uh\nby the as Vision then you need to train\nthat model you need to train your own\nmodel create your own model and train it\nand then it will work for you right but\nin most of the cases the AI vision is\nalready pre-trained right we will see in\nthe handson session further and uh we\nwill see uh how these things happen and\nuh how AI vision is helpful in an\nanalyzing images extracting uh data from\nthe images right moving to the next\ntopic we will be having some uh overview\nof AI vision service uh the key\ncomponents are image analysis so in\nimage analysis uh we identify image uh\nin image analysis what AI Vision can do\nis it can give you the tags of the\nimages right uh let's say there are four\nthings in your image four kind of fruits\nit will give you the tags let's say\nfruits are there it will give you tag as\nApple Orange right it will also identify\nthe objects what are what all objects\nare present in your images let's say\napple let's say orange let's say banana\nokay it will all also generate a caption\nfor your image right let's say there is\na image there are mountains or there\nthere are mountains and uh uh there are\nhomes available in the image right seen\nin the image so it will generate a\nbeautiful caption for you for that\nspecific image right uh it can be\nhelpful in OCR optical character\nrecognition means it will uh extract\ntext from your image let's say You have\ngiven an image to the aurei vision and\nthere are text written on the images so\nwhat it it will do is it will extract\nthe text from your images and it will\ndigitalize your you know uh the data\nright how it works uh you can use a\npre-rain model to analyze visual data\nand you can also customize it through\ncustom Vision you can give your own data\nset you can train your data train your\nmodel and then after that after training\nyour model you can just give uh any kind\nof object or you can you know Implement\nin uh in your SDK uh if you want a\ncustom train model okay uh you can\neasily integrate with other Azure\nServices which I have already\ncovered now uh let's move to the next\nslide uh we'll be seeing the basics of\nimage analysis uh what exactly it\ndetects and when to use image analysis\nso what exactly detects uh I have\nalready covered uh you know object in\nobject it can Det anything car animal\nEtc infus is an emotion let's say there\nis an image and somebody is standing and\nthat person is very happy that person is\na smiling so that uh your AI Vision can\ndetect detect that this person is a\nsmiling you know this can detect\nemotions and this can detect faces in\nthe images as well right this can also\ndetect text and handwriting let's say uh\nyou have a PDF document which is typed\nso it can detect that as well if you\nhave a document which is handwritten\nthis can detect that as\nwell okay when to use image analysis you\nit's up to you there are many use cases\nwhere you can use is use it uh here are\nfew use cases which I have mentioned the\nfirst one is automating automating uh\nvisual interpretations building\nsearchable image libraries and content\nmoderation right so these are some of\nthe use cases where you can use your uh\nuh computer vision or AI Vision right\nnow moving to the next slide where we\nwill be understanding the uh OCR with\nAzure AI Vision so what OCR is basically\nOCR is optical character recognition so\nwith the name uh you can understand that\nthis is uh this is\njust recognizing the characters present\nin the images or videos right and the\naccuracy of this OCR is is in such a way\nthat you know even uh if there are small\nuh you know words written in a very\nsmall size or very large size it can\nidentify each and everything right it\nalso supports multiple language so\nthat's the beautiful thing about it\nright let's say English is the common\nlanguage we use in the in in in our\ncountry or in other countries as well\nbut let's say in India Hindi is the NA\nnational language so if your document is\nwritten in Hindi okay Hindi language\nthen also it can you know extract\ninformation from images it can uh\nsummarize your document it can extract\nuh meaningful information it can give\nyou metadata of your documents so this\nis the beautiful thing about aure AI\nvision and see everything is pre-trained\nright let's say there is a document\nwhere you have written date uh let's say\nuser ID let's say your ID uh government\nID number it will extract that it will\ngive you that right and what is the uh\nbenefit of this what is the application\nof this again I'm telling you three\napplications but the fourth application\nwill be dropped by you in the comments\nand I would be happy to check that after\nI finish my presentation so keep on\nthinking how you can use your computer\nvision models how you can use Azure AI\nVision that are pre-trained and uh you\ncan build Solutions out of that so this\nis the main model motive of this session\nthat we will be Building Solutions we'll\nbe talking about Solutions of computer\nvision of AI Vision in what all areas we\ncan implement it what all things we can\nextract from it right now I'll be\ntalking about application of OCR so the\nfirst application is digitizing printed\nmaterials right let's say you have a\nhard copy right what it'll do it will do\nit will just scan your hard copy and it\nwill digitalize for you\nnow you can keep that in your phone\nthere are many applications which are\nalready there which does this task which\nyou know uh you you must have used uh\nmany applications for this task but this\nis one of the applications right which\nuh uh which is digitizing printed\nmaterials even not digitizing you can\nyou know extract meaningful information\nand you can digitize that as well you\ncan keep that in a secret folder or you\ncan uh just you know throw your document\nwritten document and whatever the\nmeaningful information you need you can\njust extract from it through OCR and you\ncan keep that in your mobile phone right\nanother application is automating\ninvoice\nprocessing how this work let's say uh in\nyour Supermarket you are going and uh\nyou have bought some some things from\nthe supermarket and and now uh they want\nto give you the invoice right so what it\nwill do it will you know scan the\nobjects scan the products automatically\nand it will generate the invoice right\nhere are many applications which you can\nImplement even in Azure AI Services\nthere are many uh uh you know Services\nwhich are available and you all you can\nImplement all these things for\nexample let's say in your Supermarket\nI'm just thinking I'm just thinking how\nwe can Implement different things in\nyour Supermarket you have bought\nsomething and your Supermarket is\ncompletely\nautomated right you went there and uh\nwhat you did is uh uh through custom\nVision what you have did is there is a\nscanner available you scan your product\nand all the products will be listed\nafter that there is\na\nuh voice detection you have enabled\nthere you have used voice detection\nfeature so what you will do is uh you\nwill uh uh maybe speech to text you are\nusing right\nyou will tell your name and it will just\nwrite it there right you will whatever\ninformation they need you will speak it\nout right and all the informations will\nbe listed in the invoice the invoice\nwill be generated automatically and it\nwill give you a print out see how\nhasslefree it has become through AI if\nwe start using AI in every field it will\nbecome hasslefree it will become easy\nfor people right so that's how we can\nImplement OCR right another uh uh very\nuh meaningful uh application of OCR is\nreading license\nplates now let's say uh there is a\nvehicle which has hit you and they just\nuh ran away now what you can do you can\njust scan the number plate of that\nvehicle immediately and it will give you\nall the information of that number plate\nthe O information of owner the address\nof the owner each and everything right\nand then you can keep it with you you\ncan just go to the police station you\ncan file the FI you can give all the\ninformation they can even they can\nidentify let's say you do not have all\nthe access to know the address and\nmobile number of that person who has\njust ran away but police has that access\nso you can just give a small data about\nthat number plate or about that person\nthey can identify them and they can just\ndo their work they can take the legal\nactions this is how we can Implement OCR\nin different ways now moving to the next\nthing uh we'll be talking about custom\nVision models in a your AI Vision right\nso there are two types of model which we\nhave discussed but now we'll be\ndiscussing in details there are two\ntypes of model one is pre-built model\nanother one is custom models pre-built\nmodel is already on Azure AI services\nand uh custom model uh is trained by you\nright you will give a you will have a\nset of data set you will give it to the\nAzure AI vision and it will train the\ndata set and then after that you can use\nthat data set to identify things okay\nnow what are pre-built\nmodels so uh as it is written here Asar\nAI Vision provides model that can detect\nGeneral objects face and text okay it is\nuseful for quick deployments when your\nuse cases align with the default\ncategories let's say uh again let's take\nan example of supermarket in your\nSupermarket it is all generalized okay\nokay and all the use cases which are\navailable in your pre-built model\nmatches with your demand okay that you\nalso need that in your Supermarket then\nyou can use pre-built model\nokay uh what can be the limitations\nlimitations uh are uh it has limited\nflexibility for a specific or unique\nobject detection needs right so it is a\ngeneral model so let's say there is\nsomething which is unique to you only\nonly you know only you want that to be\nidentified by the computer vision then\nat that time you cannot use pre-train\nmodel you have to train your custom\nmodel and then you can use that for your\nsolution right now coming to the custom\nmodels it allow you to tailor the model\nfor specific object detection let's say\nin your Supermarket let's take an unique\nthing there is a brand only made by you\nokay there are spices which are which\nare made in your company\nyou own that company now that brand is\nnot available\non this pre-built models right so to\nidentify whether a person is carrying\nyour brand or not you need to train your\ncustom model you need to build your own\ncustom model where you will be giving a\ndata set where where your brand is there\nright so now what will happen is at this\npoint of time you'll be using custom\nmodels which will identify as per your\ndata set which will identify whether\nthat person or whether that object is is\nof your brand or not right so this is\nlike they both have uh uh different\ndifferent useful features they they both\ncan be used in you know different\nscenarios so I think it is clear to you\nguys where you can use pre-built model\nand where you can use custom models\nanother thing is uh use cases where\npredefined model falls short such as\nidentifying custom objects logos or\nspecialized object in your domain so\nthis we have already discussed uh key\nadvantages is high flexibility right\nokay so you can\ntrain whatever model you want right or\nyou can train for whatever thing you\nwant train the model on your own data\nset to recognize domain specific items\nright domain specific means uh it is\nabout your domain what you want to\nidentify using custom Vision right so I\nhope this topic is clear to you guys uh\nuh on what are pre-build model mod what\nare custom models how we can use them in\ndifferent\nscenarios now moving to the another\ntopic so we have talked about uh custom\nmodels that there are custom models\nwhich we can train but the question\narises how we can train it right so this\nis the main question and I think in\ntheory we learn a lot of things that\nokay we can train a model we can use\nthat model for our use cases for for uh\nuh in our scenarios but but then when it\ncomes to training a model practically I\nthink there many people fail there we\ndon't know how to train a model how to\ntrain our custom Vision model so today\nwe'll be understanding how we can train\nthe model so right now I'll be telling\nyou the steps to train a model and after\nthat we'll be doing a demo session demo\nsession where we will be understanding\nhow we can exactly train a model on\nMicrosoft Azure okay so the step one is\ncollect and label images what you'll do\nhere you will gather a set of data set a\nlarge data set okay you will gather a\ndata set let's say uh I'll be showing\nyou some I'll be giving you some example\nof data sets as well uh let's say you\nhave collected a data set of\ncars thousands of cars right and you\nwant to identify the color of car okay\nthe color of each car let's say you you\ndon't want to identify the brand and uh\nthe model of the car but let's keep it\nsimple we we are identifying the color\nof the car so what we can do is we can\ncollect different cars of different\ncolors okay then we will label that how\nwe label that uh there is one step when\nwe uh you know upload images on custom\nVision model there is an option comes\nfor labeling so we can directly label\nthat image there but manually uh uh how\nwe label it we will just Mark that image\nin a box okay and then we label that\nthat this is a blue color this is a red\ncolor Okay red color blue color white\ncolor gray color okay so this is how\nlabel it so you need to collect the\nimages and then you need to label it\nokay so here the first step first step\nis gather a data set of image showing\nthe object you want to recognize okay\nanother one is label the images to\ncategorize them\naccurately so the tip here is use images\nfrom different angles and lighting\nconditions so this is very important if\nyou want a good accuracy level okay you\nneed to take different angles you but in\ncolor it won't be required because uh uh\nit will be easy for the uh AI model to\nidentify the colors because you know\ncars are in big size and you can just uh\nclick picture from one angle\nor just one angle is required in that\nand you can label that right so this is\nthe first step collect label images now\ncoming to the Second Step upload images\nto as your computer vision uh sorry\ncustom Vision okay so you will be loging\nto the custom Vision studio and then you\nwill create a project upload your\nlabeled images uh and then you will uh\nchoose the right domain or uh you will\nchoose what what things you are going to\ndo with this uh domain right so I'll be\nshowing you through hands on how to do\nit so you have collected the image you\nhave labeled them now you have uploaded\nit to custom Vision now coming to the\nstep three you will train that model\nokay nothing much is required after you\nhave uploaded the image you have labeled\nthem you have given uh uh the right\ndomain for that image now you need to\ntrain it after training is done you need\nto test it and deploy so see how simple\nis this right this is that simple that\nyou can easily if you have a data set\nyou can easily train this model you can\neasily train your custom model\nright sorry so this is that\nsimple and uh there is one information\nwhich I would like to tell you on custom\nVision uh let's say you want to train a\nmodel for a single type of data set\nlet's say uh in your data set there are\nwhite color cars there are red color\ncars there are black color cars right to\ntrain a model the minimum of 15 objects\nare required okay 15 images are required\nto train a model let's say if you want\nto train a model for white car then\nminimum 15 images should be there okay\nif there are 14 images you will get an\nerror your your custom Vision will say\nthat there are no not sufficient images\nto train it so at least there should be\n15 images this is a very important\nquestion this can be asked asked in your\nAI engineer associate exam that what are\nthe minimum number of images required to\ntrain a model so the answer should be 15\nokay it's 15 not 550 it's 15 so answer\nshould be 15 now we have understood\ntheoretically that how we can uh train a\ncustom Vision model right now coming to\nthe next step the realtime video\nanalysis okay we have understand we have\nunderstood the things related to images\nnow we'll be understanding things\nrelated to realtime video\nanalysis so uh your computer vision is\nalso helpful in analyzing the videos in\nreal time let's say uh we have taken an\nexample of your\nSupermarket okay so let's uh start from\nscratch what exactly happens when there\nis a real-time video analysis going on\nokay so first we will understand from\nthis uh the use cases can be security\nsurveillance and traffic monitoring and\nRetail okay uh how Azure AI Vision\nhandles the video this we'll be talking\nin some detail\nDET you uh must have recorded videos\nfrom your mobile phones okay so what\nexactly happens can can anybody tell me\nwhat exactly happens in the\nbackground if there are comments I would\nrequest moderator to you know um just\nshow those comments on the screen\nU just one\nminute I want to see\nokay you guys can drop your comments uh\nI'll see it later so uh I'll tell you\nwhat exactly happens when you record a\nvideo your video is captured in frames\nwhat exactly happens is your camera\ntakes pictures let's say you are\nrecording a video you are moving from\nthis side to this side so what happens\nis uh your camera is clicking pictures\ncontinuous pictures from this side to\nthis side and that pictures are merged\nin such a way that pictures when you\nplay that video that pictures moves in\nsuch a way that you feel that there is a\nvideo running on your mobile screen but\nactually the images are moving you uh\nlet's take an example beautiful example\nyou must have seen that video uh where a\nperson draws you know characters in in\nthat small\ndiary at every page there are different\ncharacters okay and at different angles\nokay now what happens is when that\nperson uh just blows The Diary in such a\nway in one go you will see that\ncharacter moving right so this is\nexactly happens in video analysis when\nyour computer vision is analyzing a\nvideo it is capturing\nframes okay then what happens is in in\nthose frames it identifies what is\nthere let's say in micros seconds it has\nCapture One frame and it will will\nidentify uh that there are three persons\nstanding there is something uh kept on\nthe desk there is something there is a\num there is a bucket in the store there\nare some soaps in the stores right so\nwhat happens is it process video frames\nin real time right so this is the what\nthis is what the first point is uh\ntalking about it processes videos and\nframes in real time and then it analyzes\nwe will all Al be seeing how you can\nanalyze videos right let's say uh you\nhave given a video to custom Vision\nright computer vision and you want to\nsee uh let's say there is there is\nsomething which you want to see whether\nthat is available in that video or not\nso you will write that thing in the uh\nin the search box and it will just\nextract from your video that image or\nthat object and it will show you whether\nit is available in that video or not\nright so this is also we'll be\ndiscussing we'll be also doing a demo\nfor this uh I hope you have understood\nthis thing that how realtime video\nanalysis happens\nokay now coming to the next Point\nintegrating integrating with Azure\nfunctions and automations now we have\ntalked about we can we can integrate\ncomputer vision Azure AI Vision with\ndifferent services available on\nAzure so what are the benefits of it\nright why you should automate it right\nthe first thing thing is trigger actions\nbased on image or video analysis results\nautomatically okay and uh the use cases\ncan be upload uh and imaged to the Azure\nblob storage let me explain it to\nyou why you should first first uh uh\nthing is why you should do it why you\nshould Implement different services with\nuh computer\nvision the importance is it will\nautomate things for you right let's say\nin our computer vision we we we are\ndoing it manually let's say we are\nuploading an image and it is identifying\nthings for us it is giving us tags it is\ngiving us captions or it is just\nextracting all the metadata from it okay\nbut now uh if you guys are aware of\nazure services like blob storage aure\nfunction Azure logic app and the custom\nVision which we are talking right right\nnow I'll just give you a scenario how\nthis can be helpful to you\nlet's say you are implementing all the\nfour Services okay and you want to\nautomate each in everything right let's\nsay you have a website okay you have a\nwebsite now what what happened uh what\nhappens is uh a person comes and uploads\na image on the\nwebsite so that's that website is\nactually something where people can\nupload their captured photographs and uh\nthat is is actually a directory you have\ncreated a directory for the\nphotographers and they can upload their\nimages on on your website now what\nhappens is what the what the thing is\nyou want to\ncheck that there should be appropriate\nimage right there should not be an image\nwhich can be harmful or which have uh uh\ninappropriate content okay now what you\ncan do is let's say person comes uploads\nan image on your website now that image\ngoes to the blob store\nokay now you have connected your blob\nstorage to computer vision okay means uh\nlet's say your Azure function is also\nworking so whenever image gets uploaded\nto The Blob storage the Azure custom\nVision API calls and then it analyzes\nthat image okay it extracts data from it\nokay and it has extracted all the\nimportant data or if you have your own\ntrain model the custom model uh you can\nuse a custom model whether to identify\nlike what exactly you want to check in\nthe image so in that cases I think you\nwould be using custom models so it has\nyour API call have happened and your\ncustom model has identified whether that\nimage is appropriate or not appropriate\nif that image is not appropriate what is\nthere in that image let's say it can be\nkilling of an animal that is not\nappropriate right so killing of an\nanimal is not allowed that picture is\nnot allowed in your website site right\nso your custom Vision will identify that\nthis picture has uh uh this this image\nis not appropriate there is a there is\nsomeone who is killing an animal which\nis not not good at all now what will\nhappen there is a logic app you have\nalso created a logic app logic uh you\nhave also created Logics actions in your\nlogic app in logic app designer what\nwill happen is when your uh custom\nVision has identified the problem\nyour logic app triggers and then it will\nsend you an email it will send you an\nemail of the information of that person\nthe mail ID the name and what is there\nin the image which is which is not\nappropriate now on that action the\ndecision taken by your AI\nmodel will be sent to you now you have\nto take\naction now you can directly reach out to\nthat person you can directly call that\nperson that delete that image this is\nnot appropriate for the\nwebsite I I hope you have understood how\nthis has automated a very big\ntask let's take another scenario let's\nsee let's take an example uh where you\nhave not implemented this automation you\nhave not implemented different asure\nservices with your with your computer\nvision a person comes uploads an\nimage and uh now that image is there\nokay now every day uh at the end of the\nday you are going to your website and\nyou are checking how many images are\nbeing uploaded today uh who all uploaded\nthese images and you are check checking\nevery single image\nmanually and you are checking whether it\nis appropriate or not see you can just\nimagine how time taking this action can\nbe right and then uh when you have\nanalyzed that this image is not\nappropriate then you will be reaching\nout to that person and then asking them\nto remove but from the morning to the\nevening the uh I I think many people\nhave already seen it and your ratings\nthe website ratings has been\ndecreased but if you are using your\ncomputer vision your custom Vision you\nare using different as your services and\nyou are integrating all these services\nin in in your\nsolution then it becomes easy for you it\nbecomes easy it becomes uh like your\ntime is reduced you have a lot of time\nto work for some other thing because\nmost of the things are getting done\nautomatically and at the end of the day\nthere are many options in your logic app\nuh where you can set timers for emails\nlike for every two minutes you will get\nan email or uh with every image upload\nit will directly analyze that image uh\nright and your logic app will trigger\nand then it will send you an email with\nall the data available in that image\nright so your your manual job has been\nvanished right so this is this is one of\nthe solutions I have discussed with you\nthis is how computer vision solution we\nImplement computer vision solution using\nAzure AI services using Azure AI vision\nand that's the main motive of this\nsession that we are not only learning\nhow to you know analyze an\nimage I'm sorry we are not only learning\nhow to analyze an image how to just\ndirectly go on your portal and and use\ncomputer vision just give an image to\nthat uh service and it will just extract\nuh the information from it no that's not\nthe thing we are going to do but the\nthing is uh which we want is we want\nsolutions for our\nsystem right so one of the solutions\nwhich have which we have discussed is uh\nlet's say you have your website and you\nhave integrated many of your services to\ncreate a solution for for your job\nright for the job you want to be uh you\nwant to get done right so this is one of\nthe solutions we have discussed\nsimilarly in many fields in many ways\nyou can use computer vision solutions\nfor your uh for your applications for\nyour system for your environment right\nit can be used anywhere it can be used\nin agriculture it can be used in health\ncare it can be used in maintaining\nsecurity right it can be used in\num road traffic it can be used for uh\nfor uh\nlaws to maintain laws right so there are\nmany ways I hope uh how we can integrate\nuh things how we can integrate different\nasour services to computer vision is\nclear to you and the main most important\nthing is please uh understand that if\nyou're not implementing not integrating\ndifferent services at one places at one\nplace then then it is it is not a good\nidea right so please learn about other\nservices as well uh because this\ncomputer vision can be a very useful\ntool for you guys if you want to\nintegrate AI in your\nsystem now moving to the next topic\nwhich is very important you must have uh\num heard about responsible AI right so\nwhen we do image analysis so there are\nsome cases where you know where you give\nlet's say if you give an image of a\ncelebrity to the AI it will not identify\nit it will just deny because that\ndoesn't come under the terms and\nconditions of responsible AI responsible\nAI would not allow it for you right\nso understanding responsib is also\nimportant that uh uh if you are also\ntraining your custom models you also\nneed to Define things uh where you know\nall the responsibilities of the\nimportant data can be taken care of\nright and if we talk about the security\nand best practices you need to ensure\nwhatever data you are giving to the AI\nit should be\nencrypted right and there should not be\nany confidential information available\non the image on the document or in the\nvideo or whatever uh whatever uh thing\nyou are giving to the AI whatever data\nyou are giving to the AI so this is very\nimportant because you know you don't\nknow where your data is going you never\nknow like we are using many tools these\ndays uh where we just give a prompt\nwhere we give our information and then\nit will write things for you or it will\njust design things for you but before\ngiving your information try to\nunderstand or think about it when you\nhave given your own information your\nconfidential information to the AI where\nthat data is going right so it is always\na good choice or it will it will always\nbe a good decision for you to take take\ncare of your data do not share any\nconfidential things to the AI okay uh\nlet's say if you have a system you are\nthe administrator of your Microsoft as\nyour portal where you have some AI\nSolutions deployed and now you want\nother people to access it so always use\nuh identity and access management and uh\ngive only limited permission to the\npeople or to the tenants who who who are\nthere uh you only give permission\nwhatever should be accessed by them and\nnot more than that right so this is also\nbest practices for this you need to\nregularly audit and monitor usage right\nyou need to uh at the end of the day you\nneed to come to the a portal you need to\nmonitor what all happened uh you need to\nmonitor the usage you also need to\nmonitor the cost because uh what happens\nis it has happened with me many times\nand what happens is uh I just deploy a\nservice and then I leave it I do not\nstop it or I do not delete it right so\nit is it is important when a service uh\nusage is done uh let's say that service\nis no more required you should stop it\nokay you should delete that service so\nthat it does not incur cost for you\nextra cost for you right so we have\ntalked about uh the rbac role based\nAccess Control you need to set some IM\nuh access controls IM IM roles for the\nuser so that they have limited access\nuh your data should be encrypted uh in\ntransit and at rest so these are the\nimportant security and best practices\nwhen you are using artificial\nintelligence or custom Vision or AI\nVision or any AI\ntool now coming to the pros and cons of\nazure AI Vision Pros can be we can\nintegrate it easily with other Azure\nservices this is flexible and scalable\nbecause this is hosted on cloud and we\nhave pre-trained model for fast\ndeployments okay you you don't need to\ntrain models for General things let's\nsay you want to identify animals so you\nyou don't need to train it because you\nknow the animals which are there in the\nworld I I don't think that uh this spre\ntrend model have any uh would have\nmissed that right so you can use this uh\npre-train model for fast deployments the\ncons can be cost maybe a higher concern\nso I already told you that if you are\nnot using a surface you need to\nstop that service or you need to delete\nthat service because uh AI Services has\na bit higher cost okay let's say if you\nhave a small data set then you do not\nneed to worry but if you have a larger\ndata set to you know train then cost can\nbe a big factor so you need to take care\nof each and everything you need to be\nvery active when you are training a\nmodel and uh you need to monitor each\nand everything on a daily basis right\ncomplex custom models may require\nsignificant training time yes uh if you\ntrain a model I'll be showing you I'll\nbe showing you even the smallest model\ntake uh minimum 15 20 minutes or 15 or\nor 30 minutes or or uh maybe 1 hour also\nto train a model right so complex if you\nhave a complex custom models then it is\ngoing to take some time to train that\nokay and uh it has limited offline\ncapabilities you need to be uh you need\nto require Cloud access if you are using\na or AI Vision\nright now coming to the demo part uh\nthis is going to be very interesting for\nyou guys so uh be there and I'll will\nshow you uh in the demo we'll be uh\nseeing how how things can be done the\nfirst thing we'll be setting up the\nAzure a vision resource second thing\nwill be we'll be doing image\nanalysis uh third thing will be we will\nbe implementing OCR and the fourth thing\nwill be we'll be training a custom model\nI'll be showing you how you can train a\ncustom model if you want to have your\nown uh\nown own trained I mean customly trained\ncomputer vision model okay and we at the\nend we'll be also seeing how we can uh\nanalyze things from a realtime video\nokay we'll be doing realtime video\nanalysis now let's come to the demo part\nI have already logged into the ajob\nportal if you search here\nuh a your AI Services you will see that\nuh there is a drop down that is AI\nServices you will go there and then\ntoday we are mostly talking about the\ncomputer vision and custom Vision\ncomputer vision is a pre-trained model\ncustom vision is a service where we can\ntrain our own data set we can we will\njust we will be giving data sets to it\nand we can train it and we can test and\ndeploy it\nokay first uh let's move to computer\nvision okay how to create it we will\nclick on\nCreate and uh we will select the\nresource Group we will give a name let's\nsay asure\nAI\nassociate okay we will select the\npricing tier so right now we are going\nto select a standard S1 and uh we will\njust check this that we have\nacknowledged all the terms and\nconditions and then uh for the\nnetworking thing uh let's let's uh keep\neverything as default and we will click\non review plus\ncreate then once the validation is\npassed we will just create this service\nand the service is going to take uh 3 4\nminutes okay\ncreate okay\nokay now validation passed and we have\nalready created the resources now\ndeployment is in progress it will take\naround 1 to two minutes to deploy the\nservice okay deployment is\ndone now we'll click on go to\nResource and here we have an option to\ngo to Vision\nStudio we will click on\nthis okay now we are in the vision\nStudio\nyou can see there are different options\nfor different kind of analysis we have\noptical character recognition where it\nwill extract text text from images okay\nwe have spatial analysis like count\npeople in the area or detect whether\npeople whether a person has crossed a\nline or detect when people enter or exit\na Zone this is a video retrieval in\nsummary okay this is Monitor social\ndistancing so see how beautifully this\nis uh this has been done in uh the\npandemic uh this could have used as a AI\nfeature for different places let's say\nfor a shop for hospitals or for mall\nright so uh first uh another one is uh\nface analysis it will detect faces in\nthe image it will detect the liveliness\nand it will uh uh portrait your image it\nwill also uh match your photo ID let's\nsay again let's take an example for your\nsuper store\nit will just match uh you know that\ncomputer vision will scan your face and\nit will also scan your ID ID card and it\nwill match whether this ID is yours or\nnot so that is again a very beautiful\nfeature now coming to image\nanalysis so for image analysis we have\ndifferent things available here we can\nrecognize products on shelves okay uh we\ncan customize model with images and uh\nuh we can search photos with image\nretrieval\nimage retrieval means uh from uh you\nknow from one image it will retrieve\ndifferent images and it will search\nphotos for you okay this is a very\ninteresting thing add dense captions to\nimages okay if we use this feature add\ndense captions to the images then what\nwill happen is we will give an image to\nthe AI it will create an caption or it\nwill generate different captions for you\nright uh we'll be using this one um\nanother one is remove background from\nimages uh it will remove background from\nyour image it will add uh this one is\nadd captions to images it will add\ncaptions to your\nimages and uh so these captions will be\nuh kind of smaller captions okay\ngenerate a human readable sentence that\ndescribe the content of the image and\nthis will generate generate human\nreadable con captions for all important\nobjects detected in your image okay so\nwhat what is the difference between\ndense caption and uh this this one this\ncaption so dense cap caption is\nbasically let's say your image has\ndifferent objects so it will create a\ncaption including\neverything right if we talk about this\ncaption let's say there is an image\nwhere single object is there so it will\ncap it will generate a caption for that\nokay for a single object uh detect\ncommon objects in the images so when you\ngive an image to the computer vision it\nwill detect what all objects are present\nlet's say if this is a sample there is a\ndog there is there is a house there is\nhome okay and extract common tags from\nimages it will extract tags tags means\ndog home son\nokay detect sensitive content in an\nimage this is also an important thing\nokay see this feature you can use in\nyour website the example which I have\ngiven okay you can use this feature and\nyou can detect sensitive content in in\nan image if the sensitive content\navailable in this data set is uh\nmatching with your demand\nif that is not matching you need to\ntrain your custom\nmodels uh you can create a smart cropped\nimages let's say there is a big image\nand you want to crop a specific part so\nthe uh AI Vision will automatically crop\na specific part and it will give you a\nrelevant relevant thumbnail or re\nrelevant cropped image from that image\nokay so these are all the services which\nare used for image analysis right now we\nare going to use this add dense captions\nto\nimages\nsee uh\nsorry okay so this is the uh page for\nadd dense captions to the images uh here\nwhat you will do you will first\nacknowledge that uh uh this is your\naccount and uh this are these are the\njust uh default images which has given\nwhich are given to this um Studio you\ncan use these images or also you can use\nor you can browse a file from from your\nown system okay we'll be doing this as\nwell uh this is analyzing this image\nlet's see what uh what analysis it gets\nit gives us let's wait for some\ntime till then uh I would like to see if\nthere are any questions\nokay no\nquestions hi everybody hi so excited I'm\nalso\nexcited right photos in the form of\nframes are captured yes so uh that's why\nit becomes easy for AI to analyze each\nand everything in detail right right\nlet's say a video is moving continuously\nthen it would it will be difficult for\nit to analyze things but if photos are\ncaptured in images or in frames then it\nwill be easy for AI to analyze each and\nevery frame and extract information out\nof it right uh hi SV yes uh these are\ninteresting solutions to avoid\ncluttering yes exactly so you can use\nthese features uh in many things right\num let's see\nokay it is still\nanalyzing let's try with the uh browsing\na file\nokay let me give this thing to to the\nAI I think there is something\nokay browse the file let's give this\npicture what is this\nerror I think there is some\nproblem if we use this\npicture invalid resource\nlet's again open the vision studio and\ntry this again once\nagain uh we will use dense caption okay\nwe'll acknowledge\nthis choose a different okay we have not\nselected the right resource so this was\na resource which I was already doing\nsome handson so this resource is already\nselected so you know when you try when\nyou acknowledge this you need to choose\nyour your resource okay so the resource\nuh Let me refresh\nit okay so this is the resource which we\nhave created so we will select this and\nwe will confirm this now we will\nacknowledge this and we will browse a\nfile we will select this\nimage perfect you see you have now dense\ncaptions for it a group of apples in a\npile close up of a green apple and a red\napple close up of several apples close\nup of green apples so these are the\ndifferent kind of captions you will get\nand if you want to get this thing in\nJson you can get this you can just see\nthis you will see this in Json format as\nwell right so there are two options\navailable to you know analyze and image\nthrough uh Vision Studio the one option\nis you can directly come to the jaob\nportal and do it but if you want to\nimplement these things these services in\nyour solution then you will be\nimplementing it in your SDK okay for SDK\nyou will be having key uh I mean keys\nand endpoints for the service you can\nuse those keys and endpoints in your SDK\nand you can just I mean seemlessly\nImplement all these services in your\nsystem and in your system you will be\nseeing this kind of solutions you will\nbe having Json format Solutions or you\ncan have this kind of uh you know direct\ncaptions as well\nuh let's\nidentify this one let's analyze this one\nlet's see what captions we have a man\ndriving a tractor in a farm see how\naccurately it is giving a caption right\na man driving a tractor this is also an\naccurate caption a blurry image of a\ntree this is this is a different caption\nfor different object a man riding a\ntractor right so for every caption it is\nanalyzing a different kind of thing the\nfirst caption if you see here it is\nanalyzing the complete picture and it is\nuh writing a caption out of I mean\nincluding each and everything so if you\nread the first caption it will say it\nsays a man driving a tractor in a farm\nit has included Farm it has included man\nit has included tractor right but the\nsecond one a man driving a tractor but\nit has not included farm right so this\ncaption is for this a specific thing\nthis a specific image a man and a\ntractor right so it depends on you what\nwhich caption you are going to use right\nso it will give you some set of captions\nwhich you can use and uh it becomes easy\nfor you to choose a caption as per your\nneed let's try some other image as well\nlet's try this one or or you want to see\nsome food is it a food or what uh it's a\nfood okay a person holding a spring of\nRosemary okay see this is included each\nand everything in the picture a person\ncutting a a sprig of Rosemary right this\nis included only this part a person and\na rosemary right so accordingly you can\njust pick the caption you need uh for\nyour resource okay now another thing is\nuh we will be analyzing uh some other\nthing as\nwell okay we'll be going to the vision\nStudio again and now we are going to\nanaliz a video let's do\nthis so I uh already uploaded a video\nhere okay in advance and these are the\nuh already available videos so this\nvideo is regarding animals okay uh in\nthis video there are different kind of\nanimals right and this video has already\nanalyze\nthings uh if you want to see it from\nscratch I'll show you let's do it from\nscratch okay I've already downloaded a\nvideo okay and uh this is that video so\nyou will upload this video and then it\nwill process that video it will see what\nwill happen is your video has already\nsome set of frames right so what this AI\nVision will do it will just separate all\nthose frames it will uh convert your\nvideo into frames right now it will\nanalyze each and every frame it will\njust detect what all things are there in\nthe video right so it is uh already in\nprocess so let's wait for it\nokay so I think the video has been\nanalyzed by the AI now what will happen\nis let's stop this video this complete\nvideo has been analyzed now you want to\ncheck whether this video has Penguins or\nnot or let's check whether this video\nhas dogs or not so you will give your\ntag\ndogs and you will search see your AI has\nidentified that this video has dogs and\nit will give you at what time frame that\ndog is see this feature can be used in\nyour Supermarket okay we are taking just\none example in this whole lecture of uh\na computer vision solutions that is\nSupermarket so again uh you can\nimplement this service in your\nsupermarket and uh uh your computer\nvision will\nuh uh I mean convert your video into\ninto frames and in in those frames if\nyou want to check whether uh a person\nwith with white shirt is there or not a\nperson with white shirt visited your\nSupermarket or not you will just give\nyour tag you will just write your\nspecific moment in this in this search\nbar and then it will it will show you\nwhether there was a person uh visited\nwearing white shirt or not right so\nthat's that's see how useful it is right\nlet's see if there are penguins uh or\nnot\nPenguins see they are penguins it will\ngive you different uh time frames so on\n2 minute 18 second this is the Penguin\non 2 minute 17 second this was there on\n2 minute 33 sorry on 33 second see pins\n32 this 41 this see how beautifully it\nhas been done how beautifully it has\nbeen analyzed by the AI\nright uh what else let's check for some\nother thing let's check for\nFox see Fox is also there in the video\nokay so you just you you can just check\nrandomly or let's say you some time back\nyou've already seen a video and you want\nto just recall whether that animal is\npresent in that video or not you can\njust come here you can just give your\nvideo to this uh computer Vision it will\nanalyze your video and you can search\nhere whether Fox is available in this\nvideo or not right whether uh let's say\num uh your friend is there in in that\nvideo or not okay whether someone is\nthere in your video or not so you can\nsearch it you can just directly search\nit after the video has been analyzed\nokay what else what else we can\nanalyze let's try this um\ntags let's try tags okay extract common\ntags uh let's use this uh already\navailable image I'll use this it will\ngive you tags person clothing forniture\nIndo table all the tags which can be\nthere okay now every tag has uh\nprobability of accuracy okay so the\nprobability of person is 99.6 60% means\nthe probability of person is higher\nright see person is there in the image\nclothing clothing probability is again\n99.4% Furniture 98 indoor 96 see the\narea is kind of indoor area uh there are\nFurnitures available uh clothing is also\navailable there is a coffee table there\nare human faces they are sitting see how\naccurately it is giving you tags there\nis couch there is laptop\nthere are people so people is a common\nthing there is a man there is a\nman wall wall is there group is there\nyes exactly three people woman is there\ncoffee okay there is a cup\nokay AI don't know whether that cup has\ncoffee or tea or any other um any other\nthing so the probability is\n64.8 C\nthat's the beautiful thing about AI it\nis giving you the probability of an of a\ntag uh that how much is the probability\nor how much percentage\nuh that that object is available in the\nimage or not so coffee 64.8 one but the\nperson's probability is 99 so the\naccuracy is\n99% but the accuracy\nof coffee present in this image is 64%\nright because AI don't know whether this\ncup has coffee or tea right so as for\nthe accuracy uh people can understand\nwhether they should take decision on\nthese Stags or the content generated by\nAI or not right if there is a better\nprobability uh uh I can take better\ndecisions using AI but the probability\nis not good I cannot take better\ndecisions using AI right I cannot take\naccurate decisions using\nAI just use us AI let's say if this AI\nhas given me this tag and my friend is\nasking tell me whether this image has\ncoffee or t or or whatever is there but\nlet's say I have not seen this image\nokay I have my friend has not shown with\nthis image he's just saying okay there\nis an image now I'll give that image to\nyour AI system your computer vision\nsystem but you are not required to see\nthat image okay your AI will tell you uh\nwhether that image has coffee or not\nokay my friend has given this image to\nmy uh train model or my computer vision\nit has analyzed this image that image\nand it has generated tags of that image\nfrom that image okay different tags\nhundreds of tags now my friend is asking\ntell me if that image has coffee or\nnot okay I'll just see the tags of this\nAI I'll see the probability of coffee\nthe probability of coffee is\n64% I this is not guaranteed that this\nimage has a coffee or not but if the\nprobability of coffee is\n99% I can say I can take a chance on\nthis I can say that yes that image has\ncoffee right so this is how you can\ndecide after your AI has decided\nsomething how you can take decisions on\nthe uh outputs on the information your\nAI has given you right I hope this these\nthings are clear to you uh now we will\nbe moving to another thing that is how\nto train your own model okay let's go to\nthis uh service I'll I'll just close\nthis uh I will also recommend you guys\nto uh just check out this this service\nyou just go on the aob portal you create\ncomputer vision service and you just do\nyour hands on with with this you you\ngive any kind of image to it okay and\nsee how it is analyzing okay because\nthis is a very interesting part even if\nyou uh you can just do this in your free\ntime as well just for the fun\nokay so I'll recommend everyone of you\nto get some handson on this okay before\nmoving to the uh training the model\nbefore moving to training model I'll\nshow you\nuh how you can learn about the custom\nVisions\nokay so this event is sponsored by Wiz\nlaabs and\nuh so all the winners at the end will be\ngetting some wizap subscriptions and I'm\nalso a cloud products associate at vlabs\nso I know how these subscriptions can be\nuseful to you because the content\nrelated to Azure which we have built\nhere that content is built by us only\nokay we have designed the content in\nsuch a manner that it will not miss any\nany Concept in that uh in that\ncertification examination let's say you\nwant to prepare\nfor\nai102 we will go to\nai102 and you see there are 40 handson\nLabs okay there are 129 video courses so\nuh when you just check out this you will\ngo to handson\nLabs okay and you will see that there\nare numerous hands on Labs which will uh\ndemonstrate demonstrate different\ncapabilities of AI this will also help\nyou in understanding how you can use\nthese services in your SDK okay uh let's\nsay this is an image develop aurei\nservice application securely by using\naure keyal now it will it will just\ndemonstrate you that how you can use AI\nservice application and you can\nintegrate aure keyal with this see this\nis the capability this is how we make\nSolutions uh using custom Vision using\ncomputer vision or using Azure AI Vision\nright so let me go to the handson lab\nsections we will get\nstarted I am telling you this is one of\nthe best applications or one of the best\nplatform to prepare for any\ncertification exam you want to prepare\nand uh if you are preparing for assure\ncertificate certification exam I can\nguarantee you I can assure you on this\nbecause we know what kind of content we\nhave prepared here and uh what kind of\nsandbox what kind of challenges right\nright let's say you are you have\nperformed a lab okay and uh you want to\ndo a challenge for it okay there is a\nchallenge there is a challenge and it\nwill give you some set of scen\nscenarios okay uh it will give you some\nset of scenarios and it will ask you to\nfulfill that scenario or to find\nsolution for that scenario now what you\nwill do you will just uh\ngo there you will deploy Services as per\nyou and uh you will see whether you are\nable to you know find a solution for\nthat service or not for this that\nproblem statement or not right and at\nthe end of the lab you will also be able\nto validate whether you have created all\nthe required services or not in that lab\nokay let's say\num let's check out this lab text\nanalysis with Azure AI content safety\nokay\nsee the content this is the lab overview\nuh this is the introduction of this lab\nand we have also given the architecture\ndiagram means how you will be uh you\nknow how you'll be performing task what\ntask will be performed after what what\nservice right these are the task details\nand when you go to the lab steps you\nwill see uh all the lab steps are given\nthere you will first create the\nworkspace and computer resource ources\nand uh uh then you will create the Azure\nAI content safety service then uh you\nwill create the environment variables\nand then you will open the vs code so in\nthe vs code you will be able to\nunderstand how you can you how using the\nkeys and endpoint of a service you can\nImplement these services in your SDK\nright so just keeping these things in\nmind we have prepared these contents for\nyou guys so if you want to uh learn\nabout or if you want to prepare for aure\nAI associate exam you can check out Wiz\nlaabs courses and uh the Hands-On Labs\navailable on this platform that's the\nbest resource you can uh you can have uh\nlet me also show you the challenges\nwhich we have created in certification\nuh you will select\nai102 let's check out this challenge\nthis challenge is about classify and\nmoderate text with aure content\nmoderator okay let's see uh what is\nthere in this challenge okay\nthese are the challenge overviews there\nare prerequisites given that you you\nmust have knowledge of isi services and\nyou must have knowledge of aure content\nmoderator you you must have a la laptop\nyou must have access to internet\nbrowsing and internet connection\ninternet browser and connection now\ncoming to the challenge steps this is\nthe detail this is the\nuh uh what we call it this is the\nproblem statement you have now see how\nthe these things can help you in your in\nyour interviews or in your exams when\nyou have a problem statement let's say\nwhen I have given you a problem\nstatement to work on I have given you a\nscenario in a company where these are\nthe problems and you you need to\nimplement or you need to find solution\nfor it this is what uh this is how we\nfind solution uh with computer vision\nwith AI Services right let's say your\nYour Leader has told you that uh this is\nthe problem in the company or in the\nsoftware and you need to find a solution\nusing AI Vision now create a solution\nthis is what solution Architects do okay\nin this challenge uh let let me read\nthis in this challenge you will showcase\nyour expertise in uh as your content\nmoderator integration Master the setup\nof content moderator resources testing\nits text moderation capabilities via API\nand evaluating responses for various\ntype of content Ensure successful\nresources creation key management and\nthrough testing to and thorough testing\nto validate the functionality of the\ncontent moderation service okay so it\nhas given you a brief what all things\nyou are going to use it or what all\nservices you are going to implement in\nthis challenge but we are not telling\nyou how to implement it we are just\ngiving you a scenario the scenario is\nKoso Corporation a global e-commerce\nplatform faces challenges in moderating\nuser generated\ncontent efficiently\nmanual moderation process leads to slow\nresponse time and allow inappropriate\ncontent to slip through impacting user\nexperience and band reput brand\nreputation to address this as a\ndeveloper you have been tasked with\nimplementing a solution by leveraging\nasure content moderator you aim to\nautomate content moderation ensuring a\nsafe and positive user environment this\ninitiative will enhance the uh enhance\nthe content quality protect the brand\nand improve overall user satisfaction\nnow you you know the problem statement\nyou know the scenario now you need to\nthink you need to brainstorm how you can\nuse different AI services and you can\nImplement Implement these services to\nresolve this\nissue this is how you develop your\narchitect mind this is how you uh you\nknow develop your knowledge base okay\nthis is how you are exposed to problem\nand you know how to solve it because\nyou've already done this in your\npreparation right these things will\nactually help you in your interviews\nwhen you're sitting for a company and uh\nand they are giving you a scenario to\nresolve it and it is just on your tips\nthat what service is there how you are\nusing it how you are automating it how\nyou are implementing implementing that\nservice through API okay and what all\nthings you are using it so that's my\nrecommendation go check out these\ncourses on Wiz laabs and the one who\nwill be getting access to whsaps\nplatform please use it wisely please\nutilize each and everything available on\nWiz laabs that will actually help in\nyour career growth and your examination\nas well now coming to\nthe custom Vision thing\nokay\nokay uh we will uh go to home we will\nclick on a your AI services and we will\ncheck out custom vision service okay so\nwhat is custom custom vision service uh\nwe will we we were understanding about\ncomputer vision and com custom Vision so\ncomputer vision is a pre-train model\nokay that can uh extract things identify\nyour images analyze your images and\nvideos extract relevant information from\nit okay custom vision is a service where\nyou will be training your model okay so\nlet's create the\nservice Resource Group we'll select the\nresource Group what are we going to do\ncreate options we are going to train it\nwe are going to train a model so we will\nbe selecting training option and uh\nregion is East\nUS\ntraining uh let's give a unique name AI\nassociate data\nset okay it is available okay training\nai ai associate data set we'll be\nselecting the pricing tier that is a\nstandard is zero we'll click on review\nand create and once the validation is\npassed we will create\nit\nokay so at the end of this session I\nhave two questions for you guys and\nwhatever I have discussed in the\nsessions I have just noted down two\nquestions from it and I hope you guys\nwould be able to answer\nthat okay it is getting deployed let's\nwait for few minutes\nokay it is taking some time let's wait\nfor it till then I would like to see the\ncomments can we do labeling using\ncomputer vision yes you can you can\ncreate labels why not there are services\navailable uh for image analysis you can\nyou can do label you\ncan uh label any object or anything\navailable in that image that's why I I\nam telling you just go on the a portal\ncreate that computer vision service and\nuh do your handson just uh go and check\nout all the services available all the\noptions available for image analysis for\nvideo analysis or for pH detection\nanalyze it uh do hands on try to\nunderstand how things are working how\nyou can Implement that thing in your uh\nin your system in your website in your\nsoftware or or wherever you want or in\nyour uh\nSupermarket okay let's uh move\nto let's see if uh the service has been\ndeployed or\nnot okay the service has been deployed\nplease let me know if my screen is\nvisible can anybody confirm me\nit should be\nvisible\nyes okay let's go to the\nresource let's go to the resource and in\nthis resource we will be uh just red\nredirecting ourselves to the custom\nVision portal so there are three options\nthe first one is get the API key to\nauthenticate your application right so\nif you want to implement it in your SDK\nyou need to have the API key okay see it\nis written here as well all the custom\nVision call require a key the key can be\nfound in keys and endpoint the keys and\nendpoint section is here okay if you go\nto the key and endpoint section you can\nuh copy the key from here you can copy\nthe endpoint from here and you can use\nthis in your SDK okay now let's go go to\nthe overview page so right now we are\ngoing to the custom Vision portal\nbecause we are doing it manually through\nAAW portal now the custom Vision portal\nis getting\nloaded on the custom Vision portal first\nwe will create a project creating a\nproject means you are creating a uh\ndirectory where you will be giving name\nto your project and what all things you\nare going to do it you will give a\ndescription project name is okay train\nmodel description let's leave it not\nrequired\num now you already know that that the\nset of images you have is what kind of\nimages right you already know that\nwhether those images have uh uh multiple\nobjects or single object okay now I have\nalready created a folder of some set of\napples red apples so I'm going to train\nit for red apples\nokay uh here are the options project\ntypes so the pro project type is\nclassification of object detection so we\nwill click on object\ndetection okay because we will be\ndetecting the object the domain is\nGeneral let's leave it now create the\nproject\nokay so we are inside the project that\nis train model okay now here is an\noption to add images he will be adding\nimages here we'll click on ADD\nimages and I already have a folder of\nred\napples I have already downloaded it for\nyou guys so that it won't take much time\nin this session to download each image\nand uh keep them in a folder and then\nupload it so I have selected all the\nimages I'll click on\nopen all the images are\nhere uh there might be some duplicate\nimage okay so we will click on upload 20\nimages so there are four Images up Flo\nfield because they they might be\nduplicate okay see what I told you guys\nuh earlier in the session is the minimum\nimages required to train a model is 15\nif images are less than 15 your model\nwill not get trained okay so minimum is\n15 maximum is as much as you want okay\nso all the images are here now what was\nthe next step let me show\nyou um what was the next step\nThe Next Step was to upload images to\nAzure custom Vision we have uploaded it\nand in the first step it was just\ncollect and label images but in the\ncustom Vision after uploading the image\nwe label it because that is a Azure\nfeature but in general we have images we\nwe add tags to the images then we upload\nit and then we train it but in custom\nVision the feature says that you need to\nupload the images and then by clicking\non each image you will be adding tags\nnow I'll be showing you how you can add\ntaxs so that is also interesting\npart\num okay great so you have opened this\nimage if you wait for some time the AI\nwill all automatically recognize the\nareas okay where you need to just uh\nMark that image right but if you want to\ndo it uh directly you can just you\nknow uh directly select the image okay\nso let's say see it it has already\nanalyzed the different areas where you\ncan add tags so let's say I'll click on\nthis I'll add it add a\ntag Red\nApple I've created a tag now I'll click\non this this is again a red apple this\nis again a red apple so these tags are\ngetting\ncreated how it helps when let's say uh\nyou give an image to the AI it will\nanalyze the complete content and it will\nfind where the red apples are available\nin that image see this is also a red\napple this is also a red apple I'm not\nclicking anywhere I'm just moving my\ncursor and it is showing me uh the\nobjects this is again a red\napple red apple now let's move to the\nanother object let's mark this one as\nalso a red apple let's move to the next\nimage this one see right now right now\nit is again showing me the objects where\nwe can mark it I'll select this I'll add\na tag I'll select this I'll add a tag\nI'll select this one as well I'll add a\ntag as a red apple I'll move to the next\npicture see in the beginning I'll show\nyou in the beginning no images has been\nclassified but see after a few seconds\nit has analyzed that these images are\nthere there can be tags added I'll click\non this red apple so right now what we\nare doing we have uploaded the image now\nwe are adding labels or we are adding\ntags to the images right the tags which\nwe want to get analyzed by the AI what\ndo you think if I give a tag to this\nobject as green apple and this object\nalso as green apple so to all the red\napples I'm giving tag as green apple\nwhat will happen at the end if you give\nafter training your model if you give an\nimage to analyze it will identify your\nred apple as aen Apple because you have\ngiven that tag so giving right tag to an\nobject is very\nimportant if there is a cycle do not\ngive a tag for bike because at the end\nwhen you give an image to your system it\nwill identify your cycle as a bike so\nthat is not correct in general that is\nnot correct maybe you want it to uh\nanalyze as a bike that might be correct\nfor you but in general it is not correct\nso giving right tag is very important\nfor your system if you you are training\nyour own custom models\nokay this is a group of Red Apple so we\ncan give this as a tag let's give tag as\nred\napple let's move to the next\npicture Okay this has analyzed red\napple red\napple move to\nnext so minimum of 15 images are\nrequired to rain a model so we have 16\nimages in this uh uh project so we will\nbe marking each and every\nimage red\napple red\napple red apple red apple\nnow what can be the another tag here\nhands or people are holding Red Apple\nbecause there are hands in this image so\nthis AI has analyzed now it is asking\nyou to give a tag but I'm not going to\ngive any tag because we are only going\nto analyze red apples and not hands okay\nso if you want to analyze whether in an\nimage if there are people holding red\napples then you can you can use this\nkind of tag you can use this kind of\nimages where people are actually holding\nred apples okay and you can give tag as\nhands are holding red apples or people\nare holding red apples let's move to the\nnext\nimage okay this one is also ER\nApple so right now we are in the process\nof giving tags to each and every\nimage\nokay Red\nApple too many\nimages so many red apples I I hope you\nyou guys are don't you are you guys are\nnot craving for red apples right now\nbecause I am feeling to have a red apple\nbecause I have seen too many red apples\nright\nnow okay and these are beautiful red\napples okay\n[Music]\nokay let's cross this okay let's close\nthis only one image is uh available here\nor one only one image is left which is\nuntagged there is an option to see the\ntagged images see for red apples we have\n15 images these all images are being\ntagged they are already tagged by us\nokay now uh if you want to see if there\nare an image which is untagged you you\ncan see that we will click on this we\nwill again\ngive a label to this image or tag to\nthis\nimage okay we have given tag now what is\nthe next step we have uh we had the data\nset we have uploaded the data set we\nhave given tags to the images okay now\nthe third step is training the model you\nwill click on train now\nsee for quick\ntraining it requires minimum of 1 hour\nokay for Advanced Training let's say you\nhave a bigger your data set so it\nrequire uh it's up to the budget\ntraining budget\nokay it require uh a large number large\namount of time and it depends on your\nbudget as well so right now we are going\nto use Quick training we will train\nit now after training you will be able\nto see the probability the percentage of\naccuracy uh because uh see the accuracy\ncannot be as good as you have seen uh in\nthe pre-trend model that you could have\nseen that for the people there was 99%\naccuracy but you see we have only given\n15 images to this custom models so 15\nimages is not enough to train a model or\nto get the accuracy there need to be\nthousands of images if you really want\nto have\naccuracy uh after analyzing an image\nright so that's why it is important uh\nto to prepare a good good amount of or\nlarge number of data set so that you you\ncan train your model for an accuracy for\na better accuracy and you can get the\noutput uh in a better manner okay but\nfor 15 images let's see how much\naccuracy we are getting and uh what is\nthe probability that uh the app Red\nApple is available in an image\nokay it is going to take some time it is\ntraining I think it will take around\nfive five minutes I guess till then I\nwould like to see the chat\nokay enjoying thank you thank you\nPima uh krishi thank you interesting\nthank\nyou if you guys have any kind of\nquestions you can drop in the chat I'm\navailable to take questions because the\nmodel is getting trained so it is going\nto take some\ntime at least 5 minutes\nso drop your questions in the chat I am\navailable you can tell me how uh what\nall things you understood or uh\num how you actually enjoyed this session\nor not you you can directly tell me in\nthe\nchats uh explain the difference between\nusing pre-built models in Azure Vision\nversus training custom models okay so\nthere are two things one is pre built\nmodel one is custom models so custom\nmodel are for youu guys let's say uh I\nalready given an example of a super\nstore okay in a super store you want to\nidentify whether a\nperson whether a person of white shirt\nhas entered your super store or not okay\nso that's a generalized thing okay that\ncan be available in a pre-trained model\nso white shirt can be identified as by\nthe pre pre-train model right so in this\ncase you can use pre-train model because\nthat is satisfying your need okay that\nis matching with your need because\nbecause that white Shir can be\nidentified by a pre-train model but\nlet's say you have recently launched\nyour brand and your brand name is\nXYZ okay now what is the probability\nthat your brand can be identified that\npre-train model I don't think there is\nany ability because you have recently\nlaunched a brand and and there is no\ninteraction of your brand with the AI\nhow would you able to identify your\nbrand using pre-train model so in this\ncase you need to have your own custom\nmodel you train your own model in such a\nway that it identifies your brand okay\nyou give all the images or all you give\nlogos to the to your model you give\nimages to your model you give images of\nobjects objects you give images of\nproducts where your Lo logo is there\nright you you prepare a large data set\nwhich can identify your logo okay you\nprepare a large data set you give that\ndata set to the custom vision and then\nin custom\nVision uh you can give tags to your\nlogos right just now uh like we have\ngiven tags to red apples there are many\napples there can be green apples red\napples but we are only giving tags to\nred apples so to identify your brand you\njust identify that area where your logo\nis mentioned and you can give tag to\nyour logo or give a name to your logo\nokay now when you use your custom train\nmodel if there is any object where your\nlogo is used or you want to see whether\nthis is this is this uh product is from\nyour company or your brand or not your\ncustom model would be able to identify\nit I hope uh now it is uh clear you got\nbetter understanding of where you can\nuse pre-train model and where you can\nuse your custom\nmodels uh what industry will it be most\nbeneficial for any\nindustry Healthcare\nuh laws enforcement Health Care uh uh\ntraffic or Product Industry or your\nsuper store or in security and\nsurveillance any industry it's up to you\nwhat exactly or how exactly you want to\ncreate a solution using the service\nright let's say even if you are in your\nroom okay and uh whole day you are just\nfeeling sleepy and you are just lying on\nthe bed whole day and you are not doing\nany work so you have trained your model\nin such a way that that if your model\nfinds you lying on the bed it will just\nuh call your parents and it will tell\nthat uh your kid is lying on the bed and\nnot studying so\nanywhere it's it depends on your need\nhow you want to implement it okay let me\nsee if uh the model has been trained or\nnot okay the model has been trained let\nme show you guys please confirm uh when\nmy screen is\nvisible okay I hope my screen is visible\nto you guys\nsee the model has been trained okay the\ntag is uh Red\nApple and these are the prec Precision\nrecall so this number will tell you if a\ntag is predicted by your model uh How\nlikely is that to be right okay so the\nPrecision is 33% means uh 15 images are\nnot enough to you know train a model to\nincrease this percentage you need to\nhave large number of or large set of\ndata sets recall is this number will\ntell you out of the tags which should be\nEd correctly uh what percentage did your\nmodel correctly find it okay okay map\nmeaning average Precision this number\nwill tell you the overall object detect\nperformance across the tags okay this\nwill give you an average that uh uh the\naccuracy maybe the accuracy of uh of\nyour object object\ndetection now we want to so here is an\noption to\npublish after publishing you can use its\nkey and end point and you can use it in\nyour s DK but right now we are first\ngoing to test it so we'll click on Quick\nTest you can give a image URL or you can\nbrowse local file so I have downloaded\nthis just one\nminute okay I have downloaded this one\nso we'll use this one whether it is able\nto identify or\nnot now uh I told you that uh we will be\nable to see the probability of uh the\nanalyzed image right so when you check\ncheck on the click on the first\nprobability Red Apple the probability is\n99.6% means you can take decision on\nthis right so the decision- making\nability is better on this uh on this red\napple okay so this red apple is this one\nthis one the\n99.6 this one you can see yes exactly\nthis is a red apple let's check the\nanother\none red apple the probability is\n96.7 but this is not a correct\nprobability because in the in the Border\nit shows as green apple again coming to\nthe point important Point 15 images are\nnot enough to train a model right it\nwill not give you the exact accuracy so\nin this case what will happen is uh you\ncan take decision only on few um few\nanalysis or or let's say the first one\nthe probability of which the highest\nprobability object the highest\nprobability object will be this one the\nfirst one so maybe you can take take\ndecision on this uh analysis but not the\nother one let's see the other one as\nwell see red apple 92.8% the percentage\nis good probability is good but see\nwhere is the Red Apple there is no Red\nApple so taking a decision will only uh\nbe you would be able to take decision on\nthe highest probability object and not\nthe other because you have only given 15\nimages to your model you give thousands\nof images it will give you accurate uh\nanalysis it will analyze the image\naccurately it will identify whether uh\nit is a r Apple it is a green apple so\nlet's say we have only used a data set\nfor Red Apple but we will give uh we\nwill also use a data set for green apple\nso in a single image it will be able to\nidentify or it will able to mark that\narea where the red apple is available\nand where the green apple is available\nso this is how you will be training your\ndata set and after training you would be\nable to use its key and endpoint and uh\nyou can just you know use it in your SDK\nor in your super store uh super store\nhas become a favorite um word in this\nsession it just came out of anywhere in\nmy mind and I took this word and I've\ngiven example many example on this thing\nso I hope you guys found it interest\ninteresting that's all from my side uh\nlet me move to the presentation I have\nfew things for you\nguys test your knowledge how can we go\nwithout testing our\nknowledge okay we have done the demo now\nthe time is for knowledge\ncheck I I uh focused on a very important\nthing when we were doing image analysis\nnow it's time for you to answer that the\nquestion is you want to use the Azure AI\nVision analyze image function to\ngenerate an appropriate caption for an\nimage which visual feature should you\nspecify tags dense captions\nobjects okay the another question is\nwhat is the purpose of the Azure AI\nvision service the first point is to\nprovide functionality for audio\ntranscription or to extract information\nfrom images or to detect the presence\nand location of a specific sounds within\nan audio file these are the two\nquestions I think they are very simple\nto answer you guys can answer it let me\nknow in the comments uh that's all from\nmy side thank you so much this is Aditya\nPand and I hope you guys guys found it\nvery useful and uh please check out Wiz\nlaabs platform for your preparation\nbecause it has the most useful content\nfor your preparation and even for your\ninterview preparation that's all from my\nside thank you so much and have a great\nday thank you so much ad for sharing\nyour expertise with us today your\ninsights have been incredibly valuable\nand we're grateful for the time and\neffort you put into this session this\nwas a really great session and now\nmoving on to the Q&A session we' like to\nopen the floor for questions if you have\nany questions fora please drop them in\nthe chat and we will address as many as\npossible don't hesitate this is your\nchance to get anwers directly from the\nexpert uh also guys uh if uh let's\nconnect on LinkedIn and uh if you guys\nhave any kind of questions you can send\nme on LinkedIn we we let's get connected\nand I would also be starting uh to\nsharing some important things or details\non important topics on the LinkedIn so\nwe can also interact there as well so\nlet me share my LinkedIn ID to the\nmoderator please share this in the\ncomments thank you sir even I had a\nquestion\nuh What uh how can developers optimize a\nAI Services a vision for image real time\nIM\nprocessing so I I already mentioned that\nyou can use that in your SDK\nuh for software developers uh you can\nuse that service in your SDK you can use\nkeys and endpoints to implement that so\nagain it's depend on\nyour use case on your demand or on your\nlike how you want to use it it depends\non what kind of solution you want to\ncreate out of it right I just cannot\nrandomly tell you A solution that this\nis how you can use it but let's say if\nyou have a software or you are a\nsoftware developer so the areas where\nyou you want to use it you need to\nidentify that because using this service\nis very easy the area the implementation\nis the important thing right so if you\nhave found the area where you want to\nuse it you can just implement it\ndirectly in your SDK there there is a\nlot of options available and even if you\ndon't know how to implement it you can\njust follow the Microsoft learn\ndocumentations and uh we have some set\nof labs also available on bz laabs so\nthat will also help\nso for the general MK like everyone\nwho's attending right now is it\nadvisable like most of them would be\nfrom first year second year or even\nthird year and now they will be making\nmaking the projects for the internships\nand right for the CV right so is it\nadvisable for them to use these kind of\nservices provided by Azure or should\nthey use the basic that how we train the\nmodels using Python and ml so how would\nyou uh get to this so the first thing is\nuh I think you do not need any advice on\nthis because cloud and AI has become a\nnorm right so this is the normal these\ndays if you're are not using cloud and\nAI I think you are somewhere you are\nlagging behind Okay so in your project\nlet's say you are creating a project you\ncan definitely use a pre-trained model\nbut let's say you are presenting\nsomething and you want to show them your\nskills so you can show them how you\ntrained your model and how you are able\nto identify what you want to check what\nyou want to analyze right pre-train\nmodel using pre-rain model is very easy\nbut but creating your own data sets uh\nlike what exactly you want to analyze\nyou create your own data set you do some\nwork you give tags to your data set you\nanalyze different objects in your image\nuh you give different tags uh in that\nimage to different objects and then you\ntrain your model and then you use that\ncustom model in your project that will\nhave better impact on the let's say\nrecruiter or on um your uh uh The\nFaculty who is checking your project\nthey will know that you know uh how to\ntrain a model and how to use your custom\nVision in your project right so that's\nhow you can implement it okay we have\none question uh how does aoria vision\nhandle data augmentation uh can it\nautomatically generate synthetic data to\nimprove model accuracy when we have a\nlimited data set such as with only 15\nimages of red apples uh can it\nautomatically generate synthetic data to\nimprove\nno uh for this smaller data set it it\nwon't be uh doing uh it won't be\nhappening uh like this but if you have a\nbigger data set let's say you have maybe\nhundreds of images 1500 2,000 images or\nthousands of images and after that if\nyou are giving images different kind of\nimages to your data set it will start\ntraining right so uh in the beginning\nyou need to train your model for the\naccuracy right the accuracy you want\nafter that it will automatically be uh\nget trained by you know using deep\nlearning and uh machine learning right\nso in the beginning it is important to\ntrain your model because uh that is your\nmodel after that it will be again uh you\nknow automatically getting trained uh by\nthe images you you are giving as input\nto the AI\nhow does it interesting itself from the\nother clouds cloud\nbased U this is a very generic questions\nuh Azure AI Vision distinguish itself\nfrom other cloud-based computer vision\nplatform see Azure AI vision is a\npre-train model and it is being trained\non a very large data set right it is a\nvery generalized model uh I\nthink uh if you remove the personal\nidentification or personal analysis\nlet's say I talked about uh the brand\nanalysis the brand of yours if you\nremove that kind of thing I don't think\nit won't be able to analyze any other\nthing it will be able to analyze each\nand everything because that is trained\non a very bigger data set right so I\ndon't know about other platform how it\nis different but I can definitely say\nthat Azure AI vision is something which\nis which is uh very Advanced uh\npre-train model very Advanced service\ngiven by Microsoft Asar\nokay how can we optimize resource uses\nto minimize\nexpense so the cost analysis we can do\nthe cost analysis there is a calculator\nby Microsoft Azure that is azure cost uh\nAzure pricing calculator you can go\nthere you can just enter your service\nand it will give you the cost right as\nper the uh timing and the amount of data\nset but the uh important thing how you\ncan optimize your resource uses or\noptimize minimize your expenses is you\nneed to\nmonitor monitoring is very important see\nwhether you are using AI or Cloud\nwhether things are already automated but\nthe end at the end of the day you need\nto monitor whether things are moving\nfine or not you need to monitor whether\nthere there is no errors because this is\ntechnology right and Technology machines\ncan throw error right we humans machines\nso what we are doing is we are trying to\ntrain a machine to be a human right if\nhuman can make errors machine can also\nmake errors right so you need to monitor\nmonitoring is the best thing to uh\nminimize your cost and uh uh optimize\nyour resource\nuses\nright\num how does aure vision handle the\nclassification object in low quality or\ndistorted\nimages see we have talked about the\ntraditional model and we have talked\nabout the Azure AI Vision what was the\nuh limitation in traditional model it\nwill not perform good in low light\nconditions and you have to hardcode all\nthe rules for that but this is the\nbenefit or this is the capability of Uh\ncustom Vision which is available on\navailable on Microsoft Azure that it can\ngive you uh Solutions or it can give you\nthe output even in the poorest condition\neven in the lowest condition let's say\nfor an image it can be low light\ncondition right for an image it can be\ndistorted image but it will identify it\nwill try to identify it will give you a\nbetter probability that what this object\ncan be right so this is the benefit of\nusing a pre-train model and the computer\nvision on a ji\nVision right uh\nso actually that's the capability of\ncomputer vision right right and uh this\nis how it got trained uh this is how uh\nit has been trained for the poorest or\nfor the you know lowest condition\navailable for thei that's why it is the\nit is one of the biggest uh model which\ncan uh identify your images which can\nextract information from your images you\ncan just imagine uh uh the\nOCR um supports different languages not\nonly English but Hindi\nSpanish or uh any other language marati\nor whatever language is there are\nJapanese so it can extract\ninformation from any kind of document\nwhether it is written in Hindi English\nor Japanese right so that's why we say\nthat uh this is one of the best feature\nof Microsoft Azure the AI uh computer\nvision and custom Vision where you can\nwhich you can use in your systems in\nyour use cases and you can create I mean\nnumber of Solutions out of it right I\nhope things are clear to you guys and I\nhope I I was able to uh clear concept\naround the computer vision solution\nusing Azure AI Vision if you guys have\nany kind of questions you can just\nconnect with me on LinkedIn and you can\ndrop your questions there I would be\nhappy to connect with you guys and I\nwould be happy to answer your questions\nthank you so much uh for everybody who\nhas been uh stick till the end and uh\nand uh understood each and everything\nthank you so much uh have a great day\nthank you so much sir it was a lovely\nsession thank you so muches thank you so\nmuch developer team thank you so\nmuch now we arrive at the moment you've\nall been waiting for the announcement of\nthe winners of the best blog or get up\npage for the previous session we've
