  "text": "last week versell unveiled NEX js15 and\nit's got some awesome new features you\ndon't need like partial pre-rendering\nhowever this is just the tip of the\niceberg for gamechanging new JavaScript\nframework updates in the last few months\nthe good news is that web developers\nhave all sorts of shiny new tools to\nplay with but the bad news is that any\nweb app you built before watching this\nvideo contains totally obsolete Legacy\ncode and will need to be Rewritten\nimmediately in today's video we'll look\nat not one not two but a ridiculous 15\nnew features in frontend JavaScript\nFrameworks that you probably don't know\nyet it is May 28th 2024 and you watching\nthe code report but first we need to\ntalk about react 19 and its new compiler\nfeature I made a full video about this a\nfew weeks ago but basically it takes a\nhint from Frameworks like spelt and\nsolid to compile code ahead of time\ninstead of using the virtual Dom which\nallows the framework to eliminate hooks\nlike use memo and use callback because\nnow it already knows what needs to be\nrendered and you don't need to jump\nthrough these hoops to do it in your\ncode that's a huge win for react and\nbrings us to the updates in nextjs 15\nnext1 15 already has support for the\nreact 19 compiler but I think the most\ninteresting new feature is something\ncalled partial pre-rendering normally\nwhen you render a web page in next it's\neither static when the data doesn't\nchange very often or it's Dynamic when\nthe data is uncashed and it's constantly\nchanging but sometimes you might have a\npage that requires both like maybe you\nhave a blog post that could be\nstatically rendered but then it has a\nbunch of comments below it that should\nbe dynamically rendered well now you can\nput static content and dynamic content\non the same page but handle everything\nfrom a single HTTP request but if if\nyou're not using nextjs there's a good\nchance you're using its arch nemesis\nremix or react router well a couple\nweeks ago they announced that these two\ntools are now becoming one and the same\nit's called remix for a reason in the\nfuture you'll get to remix your remix\ncode back into react router code but if\nthat exceeds your tolerance for\nRidiculousness another routing option\ncan be found in the tan stack it\nprovides a variety of tools that work on\nmultiple Frameworks including react but\nwhat's interesting is that it's cooking\nup a new project called tan stack start\nthat provides features like server side\nrendering thus making next JS and remix\ncompletely obsolete now speaking of\nreact another hugely awesome new feature\nis million lint this comes from the same\nguy who figured out how to make react a\nmillion times faster and basically it's\nan editor plugin that can analyze your\ncode to find performance issues it's\nreally a no-brainer for any react\nproject but you know what screw react\nit's time to move on to post react\nFrameworks like solid JS which just\nreleased solid start version 1.0 it's a\nmeta framework like nextjs 4 Solid but\neverything is served minimal and all a\ncart like you can even take the default\nfile system routing and customize it to\nwork the way you want it to pretty cool\nbut spelt has even bigger changes in\nstore a few weeks ago they dropped the\nspelt version 5 release candidate with a\nradical new RuneScape like experience\ninstead of using plain JavaScript to\nidentify reactive data you now use runes\nwhich are like compiler macros that tell\nspelt how to identify reactive data\nunder the hood these are backed by\nsignals just like solid JS but another\nbig framework also just got signals\nangular 18 was released a few days ago\nand now officially supports zoness\nchange detection you take advantage of\nit by writing signals which make your\ncode easier to read and debug while also\nreducing the bundle size thus making the\ngreatest JavaScript framework of all\ntime even better vue.js is also cooking\nup some new vaporware called Vue Vapor\nmode it's a new compilation strategy\nthat vaporizes the virtual Dom and\ninstead surgically updates the regular\nDom to squeeze out every last bit of\nperformance from an already very fast\nframework another big update is the\nrelease of quick 2.0 a highly underrated\nJavaScript framework however if you're\nhaving a hard time keeping track of all\nthese Frameworks an adjacent tool you\nshould know about is mitosis it comes\nfrom the same team that built quii and\nbasically it allows you to write\ncomponents using a subset of jsx then\ncompile them to any framework like react\nview spelt Etc it's a JavaScript\nframework for Frameworks for Frameworks\nfor Frameworks and can even turn your\nfigma components into framework code\npretty cool but we also have a huge\nupdate from the anti-f framework HTM X\nthey just drop version 2.0 and this\nchanges everything it's a JavaScript\nframework update where literally almost\nnothing changed at all but if you're a\nreal OG who never bought into the\nJavaScript framework hype you're likely\nstill using jQuery and they just\nreleased version 4.0 this release\ndoesn't add a bunch of new unnecessary\nfeatures instead it removes a bunch of\nbloat which is the final phase of\nEnlightenment for a JavaScript framework\nbut I'm still on this side of the bell\ncurve and just updated my Astro project\nto use the react 19 compiler which\nenables a cool new feature called Astro\nactions with actions we can submit an\nHTML form then write a function that\nhandles that form submission on the\nserver making it easy to handle the form\nState as well as UI updates on both the\nback end and front end but one of my\nfavorite new backend JavaScript\nFrameworks is hono I used it in my new\nstripe course for fireship pro members\nbut the framework authors just released\na new project called hono X which\nprovides serers side rendering like\nnextjs with client side hydration for\nyour frontend components but allows you\nto bring your own renderer to truly\ncustomize the way the framework works\nbut in order to use any JavaScript\nframework you'll likely need a package\nmanager like npm well there's a new\npackage manager in town called jsr and\nit comes from the team behind Dino it\nautomatically transpiles all your\ntypescript code and generates the API\ndocumentation but most importantly it\nfinally puts JavaScript developers on a\nregistry so you can identify where they\nlive in your neighborhood and keep your\nchildren away from them and there you\nhave it 15 awesome new JavaScript\nframework features for 2024 but if you\nreally want to learn how to build cool\nweb apps it's far more important to\nlearn how to problem solve like a\nprogrammer you can start making that\nhappen for free thanks to this video\nsponsor brilliant as I've said many\ntimes before the best way to learn is to\nlearn by doing Brilliance platform will\nintroduce you to essential programming\nConcepts but most importantly the\nHands-On exercises will develop your\nbrain to recognize and solve complex\nproblems that developers need to\novercome on a daily basis best of all\nevery lesson is concise and rewarding by\ninvesting just a few minutes each day\nyou'll develop habits that can level up\nyour programming skills for the rest of\nyour life and you can do it anywhere\neven from your phone to try everything\nbrilliant has to offer for free for 30\ndays visit
