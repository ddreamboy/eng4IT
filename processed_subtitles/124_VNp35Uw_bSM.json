  "text": "boom\nyou've just been attacked the bad guys\nin your system and your hemorrhaging\ndata now this was not an isolated\nincident there was a time that led up to\nthis and there was a time that happened\nafter the time that led up to it going\nback and preceding this we call left of\nboom and the time after it when we're\ntrying to discover that's the time that\nwe call right of Boom so in this first\nphase we're basically doing the bad guy\nis doing reconnaissance he's looking at\nyour systems he's probing them he's\ntrying to figure out where the weak\nspots are where the good data is and the\ntime after boom is when we want to be\ndoing recovery\nthe problem is we don't always know when\nboom occurred at the time it occurred\nthere's a lag between boom and alarm\nthis is when we find out\nwhen the attack has occurred which is\nnot the same as when it actually\noccurred\nnow if we look at these kinds of of\nintervals what could we do about this\nwell there's a time here you can see\nthat is the mean time to identify what\nthe problem is according to poneman's\nInstitute survey in 2022 the mean time\nto identify is on the order of 200 days\nthat's how long it takes to figure out\nthat the bad guy is already in your\nsystem\nand further still there's this notion of\nmean time to contain and the mean time\nto contain is on the order of 70 days\nyou put those two together you're at\nabout 270 days total between when boom\noccurred and when now we finally got\neverything recovered\nthere clearly would be some Advantage if\nwe could go back in time and discover\nand boom and bring the interval between\nthe alarm and the boom closer together\nor even go back before boom and start to\nrealize during the reconnaissance phase\nthat something is amiss something is\nhappening in this phase and this\ntimeline in this area is when we could\nbe doing\nwhat we call threat hunting I could do a\nhunt and we'll talk about what that\ninvolves after the Hunt is when we start\ndoing the investigation\nand the investigation is reactive\nThe Hunt is proactive that's the big\ndifference here so as much as possible\nit would be nice if we could go back and\nanticipate some of these things\nnow how does this work well it turns out\nwe're going to take if we're doing\nthreat hunting we're basically going to\ndevelop a hypothesis you have someone\nthat's acting as an investigator but\nthey're investigating things that maybe\nhave not fully happened yet or in the\nprocess of happening so no alarms have\ngone off what are we going to use well\nwe're going to use things like\nindicators of compromise\nthat's information that we can gather\nfrom our systems that tell us that\nsomeone has done something here that has\nbreached maybe it's a small hole here a\nsmall hole there are other things like\nindicators of attack that may be in here\nas well that says someone is knocking on\nthe door they might not have fully\ngotten in but they did some things that\nwe should be concerned about\nother sources of information would be\nsecurity intelligence threat feeds so\nIntel feeds that tell us that there are\ncertain types of vulnerabilities that\nare being exploited on the internet\nthese days and certain things that are\nhappening maybe in a particular sector\nor in a particular geography this is\nsecurity intelligence we'd like to use\nthat kind of information and leverage it\nto our best ability as well then we\ncould do some vulnerability scans on our\nenvironment and that would tell us what\nthe bad guy is also seeing and that is\nthat there are vulnerabilities here\nthere are systems that are weak here\nthis is the soft underbelly this is what\nthe bad guys doing why wouldn't we do\nthe same thing\nthen an intelligent threat Hunter who\nhas some experience and some insight\ninto this is going to use basically\ntheir experience and a little bit of\nintuition to\nconnect the dots and say these things\nthat seemed isolated in fact are not\nthey're all grouped together we connect\nthe dots and we realize before the boom\nhas occurred that in fact this is the\nsetup that's about to result in a data\nbreach or it could be in this range of\ntime when some things maybe have we've\nalready been attacked but the alarm\nhasn't gone off but we're going to see\nthe telltale signs and those are the\nthings that we're looking for now what\nwould an experienced threat Hunter use\nin terms of the tools to gather all of\nthis information well they would use\nsome tools like an xdr\nextended detection and response\ncapability and I've talked about this in\na previous video another thing that we'd\nuse is a security information and event\nmanagement system something that goes\nout and gathers information from all of\nmy sources of security Telemetry all of\nthe logs all of the flow data all of the\ndifferent sources that might give me\nsecurity intelligence and these two in\nfact can be related in feeding to each\nother and then another related\ntechnology that often relates to these\nas well is a user Behavior analytics\ncapability and the uba would look for\nanomalous user activities here's a user\nthat's performing differently than what\ntheir peer group is doing and therefore\nthey're drawing suspicion and then we\nwould ultimately want to take all of\nthose Technologies and Infuse them with\nartificial intelligence so that we can\nget to the point find the source get to\nour investigation faster and do the\nreporting and hopefully a uncover this\nissue before the boom and if not at\nleast very soon after the boom because\nwhat we're trying to do is avoid two\nnumbers\nthere's one number 270 and another\nnumber 4 million what do those mean 270\nis roughly the number of days between\nboom and containment according to the\nponymon Institute also according to that\nsame survey 4 million is the average\ncost of a data breach that's what we're\ntrying to avoid\nforeign\n",
