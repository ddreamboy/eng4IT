  "text": "Creating an ensemble of learners\nis one way to make the learners\nyou've got better.\nSo we're not talking about\ncreating a new algorithm, but\ninstead assembling together\nseveral different algorithms or\nseveral different models to\ncreate an ensemble learner.\nOne thing I want to emphasize here is\nthat you can take what you learn here\nabout ensemble learners and plug it\nright in to what you're already doing\nwith your KNN and\nlinear regression models.\nNow, what we've been doing so far,\nis that we've had one kind of\nlearning method, say KNN, we plug our\ndata into there and we learn a model.\nWe can query our model with an X and\nit will give us a Y.\nSo this is not an ensemble learner,\nthis is just a single learner.\nAnd the idea with ensemble\nlearners is that we have\nseveral additional learners.\nSo, we might have a linear regression\nbased model, we might have a decision\ntree based model, we might have\na support vector machine based model.\nYou could continue this on with any\ndifferent number of algorithms.\nThey're all trained using the same data,\nand so now we have,\nin this case, four different models.\nTo query this ensemble of learners,\nwe query each model by itself and\ncombine the answers.\nSo if we wanted to query this model\nwith X, we plug X into each model,\nthe same X and then our Ys come out.\nSo we have a Y output from each of\nthese models, how do we combine them?\nIf we're doing classification where for\ninstance we're trying to identify\nwhat the thing is, we might have\neach of these Ys vote on what it is.\nBut we're doing regression, and so\nthe typical thing to do here is to\ntake the mean, and that is the result\nfor this ensemble learner.\nWe can then test this\noverall ensemble learner\nusing this test data that we set aside.\nWhy ensembles?\nWhy do we use them,\nwhy might they be better?\nWell, there's a few reasons.\nFirst of all,\nensembles often have lower error than\nany individual method by themselves.\nEnsemble learners offer\nless overfitting.\nThe ensemble of learners typically\ndoes not overfit as much as any\nindividual learner by itself.\nNow why is that?\nHere's at least an intuitive answer.\nAs each kind of learner that you\nmight use has a sort of bias,\nit's easiest to talk about that\nin terms of linear regression\nin terms of what do I mean by bias.\nSo clearly, with linear regression\nour bias is that the data is linear.\nKNN has its own kind of bias, decision\ntrees have their own kind of bias, but\nwhen you put them together you tend\nto reduce the biases because they're\nfighting against each\nother in some sort of way.\nAnyways that's what\nan ensemble learner is like\nif we use multiple types of learners.\n",
