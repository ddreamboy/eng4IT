  "text": "in this section we will talk about some\nchallenges related to Big Data one thing\nthat you will see in almost every\npresentation about Big Data is that we\nare facing an unstoppable information\ngrowth the amount of data that we are\nhandling is rapidly increasing so if we\nillustrate the growth of data we will\nsee that we have a tremendous growth and\nwe are actually just at the beginning of\nthe curve that is going really straight\nup\nwhen we look into the big data sources\nwe want to see what are the key sources\nfor this big data traditionally we have\nour business transactions various\nbusiness systems are generating data and\nwe have more and more of this data but\nit is interesting that this part is\nrelatively well understood we have our\nrelational systems that quite\nsuccessfully handle this area but there\nare some associated forces with that one\nof the big changes in this space are the\nsocial media we have facebook and blogs\nand Twitter and the users are generating\ntremendous amounts of data now this data\nas you will see later could not be\nreally successfully stored in relational\nsystems and this area was actually very\nimportant when it comes to introduction\nin new data stores which can handle this\namount of data in addition to this we\nhave a raise of unstructured data so we\nhave a tremendous amount of text that is\ngenerated text that you would like to\nanalyze we would also like to understand\nwhat is this text about increasingly we\nhave other non structured data like\nimages and video and imagine you would\nlike to be able to make queries about\nwho is in some a video so conventional\nsystems really don't have a good support\nfor dealing with this type of data\nsources sensors are one of the most\nexciting new sources for big data\nsensors can generate tremendous amount\nof data that you need to store and\nprocess and it is likely that sensors\nare going to be the most interesting new\ncontributor to the growth in big data\nfor watching this or I'll a training\nvideo if you'd like more information on\nthis topic click on learn more don't\nforget to subscribe to the o'reilly\nvideo training youtube channel for more\ntutorials and be sure to like us on\nfacebook\n",
