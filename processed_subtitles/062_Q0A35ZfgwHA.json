  "text": "now I know my audience y'all are\naspiring software developers or current\nsoftware developers so I know you've\ncome across a video titled A Day in the\nLife of a software engineer YouTube is\nabsolutely plastered with them eating\ntyping eating meeting eating I don't\nknow why they eat so much but I've made\nmy fair share of day in life of a\nsoftware engineer even day in life\ncomputer science student and plenty of\nothers have done the same as what I\ntried to do and showed you the actual\nday and some of the actual work of a\nsoftware engineer instead of just what\nis being done just typing is a lot\ndifferent than the actual work that is\ngetting done as a software engineer but\nregardless of what they showed you every\nsingle one had something in common and\nthat is this they're all taking place\ninside at a computer and that is the\nfirst realization I want you to make as\na software engineer for most of your\nlife you're going to be inside sitting\nat a computer now personally I don't see\nthat being most suitable for most humans\nwe I'd think we weren't made to be\nsitting at a desk for 8 hours a day so\njust out the gate if that's something\nthat doesn't sound too appetizing to you\nthen you may want to take a deeper look\ninto the potential career path that\nyou're currently looking at as a\nsoftware engineer and that's what we're\ndoing in this video looking at the Hard\ntruths of being a software engineer What\nIt Takes and not just the Highlight Reel\nso let's get started\n[Music]\nmost of the experiences you see are from\nsoftware Engineers on YouTube sharing\ntheir day but that is a biased point of\nview they're entertainers they want you\nto watch the entire video think about it\nit is a lot easier to sit down and watch\nan hourlong movie that has been directed\nand filmed and has a story throughout\nrather than sitting down and watching an\nhourong lecture can we agree on that and\npeople who want to share their\nexperience want you to be captivated by\ntheir day they want you to watch the\nvideo as long as they can get you to\nwatch the video because the whole idea\nwith a lot of these channels especially\non YouTube whether it be softare\nengineer or not whole ideas for them or\nfor you to forget about the entire\noutside world and focus on their video\nwatch their video in its entirety be\nconsumed by it be entertained by it and\nwell that is the main goal whether it is\nhelping you out or educating you that is\nthe goal I only bring this up because\nit's a highlight re at best or\nmisinforming you at worst so don't look\nat these videos and think that's exactly\nhow it is because you can't see into the\nminds of these individuals they aren't\njust typing aimlessly on a keyboard\nthey're deep in thought trying to figure\nout the solution to the task at hand and\nthen doing research and implementing\nthat solution in code and in their\nmeetings they're not just shooting the\nbreeze with the co-workers they're being\ntold that the entire weeks worth of work\nbefore is completely worthless because a\nclient decided to go another route and\nthey don't want that that feature\nImplement anymore or you're being told\nthat your task was done incorrectly so\nnow you have to redo it and those\nmeetings are never fun but you know it's\nnot all bad sometimes you are just\nshooting the breeze with your co-workers\nand discussing what to do next and\nplenty of the things that I mentioned in\nthis video may be SE seen as negative or\nor whatever it may be or it may appear\nthat I'm trying to discourage some\nindividuals from becoming software\nEngineers no I'm trying to show you the\nreality of what it's like to be a\nsoftware engineer not just the good\nthing so if I do focus on things that\nare a little bit more negative don't see\nthat the majority of the job is negative\nI'm just trying to counteract all of the\npositive and all the good things the\nHighlight Reel that people are putting\nout there but neglecting to do so for\nthe bad thing because you need to\nunderstand that in any job especially\nthis job there's a give a take good and\nbad which brings us to the Everlasting\nquestion especially staying on top topic\nwhen it comes to software engineering\nYouTubers like myself I'm not I'm not\nI'm not calling anyone out in particular\nI am a software engineer and computer\nscience YouTuber just like everyone else\nand I made the same videos because the\nEverlasting question really contradicts\nhow a lot of these people portray their\nday as being always good always positive\nalways fun but most of these YouTubers\nwho display it like that end up quitting\ntheir full-time software engineering job\nto do YouTube full-time well if it is\nall butterflies and rainbows on the\nsoftware engineering side of that then\nwhy do they quit that job I know why\nI've done it but for me it may be a\nlittle bit different than most so I've\nalways wanted to work for myself if I\nnever discovered YouTube I'd probably be\nfreelancing so for me it wasn't always\nabout what I was doing as long as I\ncould do something that I enjoyed and\nwork for myself many of these\nindividuals probably shared the same\nsentiment after all they did start a\nYouTube channel for a reason that reason\ncould be because they thought it was fun\ncuz they wanted to help people out or\nbecause they saw it leading to their\nFinancial Freedom whatever it may be\nthey saw this as being part of their\nfuture but also because if they truly\nenjoyed coding this was a way for them\nto make it living but also be able to\nwork on their own projects which brings\nme to one of the biggest points of this\nvideo which I feel like people never\ntalk about that is working as a\nprofessional software engineer is\nworking for someone else's company\nworking on someone else's idea you may\nlove the idea you love working on that\napp but you never have the final say on\nwhat features are implemented or even\nexactly how it looks or the overall\ngrowth of the company and where that app\nwill be in 5 years for lack of a better\nterm you're very much a Code Monkey\nbeing told what to do and how to do it\nwith very little creative freedom some\ncreative freedom but very little I\npersonally can't work that way but for\nsome people that may be their cup you\nneed that direction you need that\nstructure so this may be perfect for you\nI know people who thrive on not\ncompleting the overall idea or worrying\nabout the overall app but solving the\ntask at hand each individual task is\nlike a new challenge for them and that\nis what gets them going in the morning\nthey know that they get to work on this\ntask that task and that task they don't\nwor have to worry about the growth of\nthe company or the growth of the app or\nthe user interface they are a back-end\ndeveloper and all they have to worry\nabout are these tasks today and that's\nbasically it there really is a luxury in\nthat if you are wired that way but if\nyou are someone who got into development\nbecause you wanted to create your own\napps you wanted to make your ideas a\nreality then it gets a little bit dicey\nthere but to sum it all up many people\nget into coding to make their ideas a\nreality it starts off as a hobby but it\nbecomes a job once you make it your job\nthe old adage says do what you enjoy and\nyou never work a day in your life life\nbut making something your job that you\ndo enjoy will often times take the\nenjoyment out of it so what is an actual\nday in the life of a software engineer\nwell this will vary from company to\ncompany team to team person to person\nbut the overall structure is typically\nthe same you have standup about every\nday this is when you get together with\nyour team you talk about what you did\nsince the last standup any roadblocks\nthat you're facing and what you plan to\ndo next now when you accomplish\neverything that you set out to do the\nday before you're confidence is through\nthe roof you're a genius programmer and\nyou just want to tell everyone what you\ndid in that standup and you love it\nhowever there's a flip side to this coin\nif you spent the entire previous day\nworking on a 2hour task and still maybe\nhaven't even figured it out well then\nyou just\nfeel bad bad no bad doesn't really begin\nto describe you begin to maybe get a\nlittle bit anxious you're very stressed\nout you feel incompetent because you're\nthe developer being paid to do a\nparticular job and complete this\nparticular task and it says it was\nestimated to be completed in 2 hours and\nyou spent 6 hours doing it the day\nbefore and you still haven't even\ncompleted it it's like if you have to\npresent something in front of the entire\nclass that you know you didn't do and\nthe whole entire class knows you failed\nbut at work you're not only worried\nabout what your classmates think of you\nor your teacher thinks of you or your\ngrade but the stability of your job your\nlivelihood I mean you tried but you just\ncouldn't successfully complete the task\nit is an incredibly stressful feeling\nthat I hated every second of when that\nwould happen to me and honestly it could\njust be because I felt like my team were\ngenius programmers I mean in their\ndefense they kind of were they had 20\nyears experience each under their belt\nso yeah needless to say I was a little\nbit intimidated by them even though they\nwere incredibly nice and helped me out\neven with those traits I still felt that\nway with that being said I could even\nbegin to think about having a boss or a\nteam that just like is mean or opposite\nof that that would suck but you know\nmaybe you're a better programmer than me\nmaybe that stuff never happens to you so\nyou never have to feel that way I don't\nknow I can tell you my experiences and\nmishaps all I want but at the end of the\nday many things cannot be learned from\nother people's mistakes often times you\nhave to make the mistake or in this\ninstance you have to experience that\nsituation in order to understand what it\nactually feels like and maybe you thrive\nin those situations maybe you hate those\nsituations but you'll never know until\nyou're in it it kind of reminds me of an\nanalogy it's like whenever you're at a\nrestaurant and a waiter hand you your\nfood and they say oh you know hot plate\nso they put on your table but you got to\nsee just how hot that plate is so you\ntouch it sometimes you got to figure\nthings out for yourself\non the job the amount of coding that is\nexpected from you is typically around 6\nhours this is how they base it on tasks\nso if you have a 2hour task a three-hour\ntask and a 1 hour task you can complete\nthat in one day but you can't complete\nanother two-hour task on top of that for\nthe eight hours a day because you have\nstandup you have meetings you have\nbreaks all of that ties in to your 8\nhour day so don't go in expecting that\nyou're going to be coding for 8 hours a\nday typically what your team should\nexpect is around six now if you've seen\nmy video how long I Cod a day you will\nsee that I'm typically burn out around 4\nhours so an extra two is a lot to handle\nbut it also depends on the work at hand\nI've spent 8 10 hours almost straight\nyou know I have to eat and go to the\nbathroom and stuff but basically almost\nstraight coding and when I say coding\nthat is basically by the definition that\nI laid out in that video how long I code\na day and that is including everything\nfrom research to actually typing out\nyour code but that's when I'm working on\nsomething simple or fairly\nstraightforward something that's already\nbeen laid out but when you have to\nfigure out how to code something that\nhas never been done in your language and\nyour stack in your context well then it\nmakes things quite a bit more difficult\nmore brain power is needed to figure out\nthe logic you have to figure out how to\nuse it in your language with your stack\nin your context and the more brain power\nyou use the more energy you use and the\nquicker you get burnt out I don't mean\nburnt out in how you've been hearing it\na lot lately but just on that day more\nbrain power is needed to figure out the\nlogic and to implement it in your\nlanguage using your stack and in your\nexact context and the more brain power\nyou use the more drained you get and\nyou're just tired I've said this before\nhow individuals who work hard labor will\nnever understand the mental drain that\nit takes to do our job because it's not\nphysically difficult and the best way I\ncan describe the difference between\nthose 8 to 10 hour coding days and the\n4H hour coding days it's like digging a\nlittle hole with a little shovel for 8\nhours a day compared to digging a giant\nhole with a real shovel you're still\ndigging coating but one is much more\ntaxing and I found a fine balance of\nbeing able to figure out when I've when\nI'm at my wits in for that day if I'm\nworking on something a little bit more\ndifficult then maybe I'm in there three\nto 4 hours don't need to worry about\nanything else at hand that needs to be\ndone I'll sa that for another day but if\nI to relax and I want to do a little bit\neasier work and nothing too too mentally\ndraining then I can do that too and I\ncan work as long as I want on my own\nprojects but when you're at work you're\nexpected to do six hours a day give or\ntake whatever your company wants you to\ndo if you have to do more then the Lord\nhelp you it's like all coding work is\ntreated equally when it's not equal some\ntasks are a lot easier than others but\nif you have a lot of difficult tasks to\ndo one day it's hard to hit 6 hours of\ncoding on difficult tasks that is one of\nthe downfalls when it comes to working\nin a professional environment and that's\nthe entire premise of what I wanted to\ndiscuss here in today's video not to to\nbring anyone away from being a software\nengineer but rather show you some of the\nrealities that others do not on the\noutside you see typing you see this\nwonderful app that they created but you\nnever see what goes on in the meetings\nyou never see what goes on in their\nheads when they're actually doing this\nwork and the difficulty of it and the\nnuances and differences of working as a\nprofessional developer than just as a\nhobby developer I hope you learned\nsomething from today's video but more so\nI hope you give it a little bit more\nthought into the potential career that\nyou're looking at based on the reality\nof it and not how it's portrayed it's a\nfun job at times but it feels like it\ncan be the worst job too let me know if\nyou've had a similar experience in the\nfield or if you've had a different\nexperience in the field completely\nopposite of how I feel because at the\nend of the day this is just one man's\nopinion one man's View and experiences\nthat I'm sharing and that's mine I can't\nreally speak from anybody else's point\nof view so I'd love to hear he some of\ny'all current software developers on\ny'all's experience what you agree with\nwhat you disagree with down in the\ncomment section below like subscribe hit\nthe bell and enjoy yourself some Icy\nPuck coffee from commenter and I'll see\nyou on the next one\n[Music]\n",
