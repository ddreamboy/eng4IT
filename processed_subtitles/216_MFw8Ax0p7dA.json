  "text": "ever wonder if there's an easier way to\ncomplete transactions without having to\ndeal with online wallets banks and\nthird-party applications well it's\npossible thanks to blockchain here's\neverything you need to know about\nblockchain imagine four friends jack ted\nsam and phil meet up for dinner after\nthey're done jack pays the bill and all\nof them decide to split the expense\namongst each other now on the next day\nwhen phil sends his share to jack via\nonline money transfer the transaction\ngoes through without a hitch then ted\nand sam send their respective shares to\njack but their transactions don't go\nthrough the failed transaction cites\nsome issues at the bank that's when jack\ncomes to know about the many ways a bank\ntransaction could fail it could be due\nto technical issues at the bank one of\ntheir accounts were hacked daily\ntransfer limits being exceeded and\nsometimes additional charges like\ntransfer charges associated with\ntransferring money to solve these\nproblems the concept of cryptocurrency\ncame into existence cryptocurrencies are\na form of digital or virtual currency\nthat run on a technology known as\nblockchain thanks to blockchain\ncryptocurrencies are immune to\ncounterfeiting don't require a central\nauthority and are protected by strong\nand complex encryption algorithms and in\na market of more than thousands of\ncryptocurrencies like litecoin ethereum\nc cash and so on one reigns supreme\nbitcoin now let's go back to our\nprevious example and have bill ted and\nsam send jack two bitcoins each as their\ncontribution to the previous night's\ndinner let's assume phil ted and sam\nhave three bitcoins in reserve while\njack has five first phil sends two\nbitcoins to jack a record is created in\nthe form of a block the transaction\ndetails between them is permanently\ninscribed in this block this record also\nholds the number of bitcoins each of the\nfriends own so after phil's transaction\njack has seven bitcoins while phil has\none following this sam and ted send two\nbitcoins to jack a new block is created\nfor each of these transactions\nthese blocks hold the transaction\ndetails as well as how many bitcoins sam\nted and jack have in reserve these\nblocks are linked to each other as each\nof them takes reference from the\nprevious one for the number of bitcoins\neach brand owns this chain of records or\nblocks is called a ledger and this\nledger is shared among all the friends\nwhich acts as a public distributed\nledger this forms the basis of\nblockchain so what happens when phil has\nonly one bitcoin left and he tries to\nsend two more bitcoins to jack the\ntransaction will not go through this is\nbecause all his friends have copies of\nthe ledger and it's clear that phil has\nonly one bitcoin left his friends will\nflag this transaction as invalid a\nhacker will not be able to alter the\ndata in the blockchain because each user\nhas a copy of the ledger the data within\nthe blocks are encrypted by complex\nalgorithms all of this is made possible\nwith the help of blockchain technology\nblockchain can be described as a\ncollection of records linked with each\nother strongly resistant to alteration\nand protected using cryptography\nnow let's have a closer look at the\nbitcoin transaction between jack and\nphil and find out how it works every\nuser in the bitcoin network has two keys\na public key and a private key the\npublic key is an address that everyone\nin the network knows of like an email\naddress of a user the private key is a\nunique address that only the user has\nknowledge of something like a password\nfirst phil passes the number of bitcoins\nhe wants to send to jack along with his\nand jack's unique wallet address through\na hashing algorithm all of this is part\nof the transaction details these details\nare encrypted using encryption\nalgorithms and using phil's unique\nprivate key this is done to digitally\nsign the transaction and to indicate\nthat the transactions came from phil\nthis output is now transmitted across\nthe world using jack's public key with\nthis the message or transaction can be\ndecrypted only by jack's private key\nwhich only jack has knowledge of\ndifferent cryptocurrencies use different\nhashing algorithms while bitcoin uses\nthe sha-256\nalgorithm ethereum which is also a\nfamous cryptocurrency uses one known as\nethash\nthis transaction and several other\nsimilar ones are taking place all around\nthe world these transactions are\nvalidated and then added block by block\nthe people who validate these blocks are\ncalled miners\nfor a block to be validated and added to\na blockchain miners need to solve a\ncomplex mathematical problem the miner\nwho solves this first adds the block to\nthe blockchain and is rewarded with 12.5\nbitcoins the process of solving the\ncomplex mathematical problem is called\nproof of work and the process of adding\na block to the blockchain is called\nmining\nwith this phil and jack's wallets are\nupdated just like every person in the\nnetwork who has completed a transaction\nnow that you know about blockchain and\nits important concepts time for a small\nquiz what is the concept of blockchain\nthat ensures data cannot be altered by\nany of the users within the network a\npublic distributed ledger b\nproof of work\nc proof of stake d\nhash encryption let us know what you\nthink is the right answer in the\ncomments below let's have a look at how\nwalmart uses blockchain to provide its\ncustomers with better service walmart\nwas facing problems in delivering\nquality products to its customers they\nwere facing a high return rate and large\namounts of refunds due to their products\nbad quality they were unable to\ndetermine the point of failure in the\nsupply chain which started from farm to\nstorage to transportation to processing\nall the way to the customer then walmart\nadopted blockchain technology with\nblockchain the quality of the goods at\neach step was permanently inscribed\nwithin a block for example when a\ncustomer flags a product has damaged it\ncan be correctly identified where the\nproduct got damaged in the entire supply\nchain thus helping walmart to identify\nthe problem areas and fixing them and\nthis is just one of several ways\nblockchain is used in real life\napplications can you think of any others\nlet us know in the comments down below\nmeet frank and daniel\none day they decide to go for a trip to\nvenice they made a budget list for all\ntheir expenses like residence flight etc\nthey thought of making their bookings\nonline from a site that offered\ndiscounts to the first 10 visitors on\nthat day\nwhile making their respective flight\nbookings daniel's transaction failed and\nhe missed the offer going on\non the other hand frank paid his share\nvery quickly and easily and became one\nof the three lucky draw winners\ndaniel was surprised and asked frank how\nhe could make the transaction when\ndaniel himself could not to which his\nresponse was it's simple i used bitcoin\na type of cryptocurrency\ndaniel was confused and he asked what\ncryptocurrency is and since when has it\nbeen in use\nfrank stepped up and explained to him\ncryptocurrency is a virtual or digital\ncurrency that works on blockchain\ntechnology and is designed to work as a\nmedium of exchange online to buy goods\nand services and make payments which was\nintroduced to the world first in 2013 by\nsatoshi nakamoto\ndaniel felt that it sounds similar to\nother online payment options he asked\nwhat makes it so different\nfrank explained cryptocurrency is\ndecentralized and free from any\nthird-party interference\nwhich means it is not issued and\ncontrolled by any government or central\nauthority unlike other payment systems\nthat banks or governments are handling\nand that's why a cryptocurrency\ntransaction never fails\nthere could be many reasons for why\ndaniel's transaction failed like he may\nhave exceeded his transfer limit for his\naccount must have been hacked or there\ncould have been some technical issue\nwith his bank server or maybe due to\nhigh transaction fees imposed by the\nbank\nbut on the other hand cryptocurrency\ncharges almost no or very low\ntransaction cost there is no limit for\nmaking transactions in fact you have 24\n7 access to your money there is no extra\ndelay or extra charges on making\ninternational transactions\nand the best part is that anybody can\nuse cryptocurrency without the hassles\nof paperwork\nall you need to do is create an account\non any digital wallet of cryptocurrency\nthis is what makes cryptocurrency\ndifferent from other online payment\noptions daniel was impressed by\ncryptocurrency but he wondered how it\nworks without the control of an external\nauthority\nupon research he found out that\ncryptocurrency works on blockchain\ntechnology blockchain is a set of blocks\nthat record information of transactions\nlike who made the transaction to whom\nthe amount of trade in the form of a\ndigital ledger that is distributed\nacross the entire network meaning the\ndata is replicated and stored on each\nnode across the entire blockchain\nnetwork making it more secure and\nimpossible to change hack or cheat the\nsystem\nthen it is verified and validated by\nevery node to proceed with the process\nof making the transactions\nthe crypto in cryptocurrency stands for\ncryptography which is a method of using\nencryption and decryption to secure the\ndata in the presence of any third party\nwith ulterior motives\nnow daniel was completely aware of the\nwhole technology and concept behind\ncryptocurrency and was influenced by\nfrank to adopt cryptocurrency in his\ndaily lifestyle too\nhe did that by booking his ticket but\nsadly no discount\nlike daniel cryptocurrency has\ninfluenced and impacted an enormous\nnumber of people worldwide\ndue to this increasing popularity new\ncompanies like metoo and paypal are\ncoming forward and investing in\ncryptocurrency every day\nin 2018 malta an island located in the\nmediterranean sea south of italy was\ntitled blockchain island as it led to\nthe economic stability of the nation\nmany fintech companies like binance and\nok x have already begun to take\nadvantage of malta's financial\nincentives and have moved their\nheadquarters to the blockchain island\nso here is a question for you\nwhich hashing algorithm does\ncryptocurrency use\na\nscript\nb\nethash\nc sha 256 d\nnone of the above please give it a\nthought and drop your answers in the\ncomments section below\ncryptocurrency is revolutionizing\nfinance and banking around the world\nthanks to cryptocurrency now anyone with\nan internet connection can trade spend\nand borrow money around the world and\nnobody can stop them\npeople like bill gates co-founder of\nmicrosoft corporation and elon musk ceo\nof tesla support cryptocurrency as it is\nmuch better and secure than physical\nmoney and also holds a great future for\nthe world's economy\nand on the other hand some people think\nof cryptocurrency as a bane to the\nworld's economy like warren buffett ceo\nof berkshire hathaway and ajay benga ceo\nof global mastercard feel that\ncryptocurrency is a platform of criminal\nactivities and will destroy the world's\neconomy\nwell one thing is clear that this\nconflict is going to stay put for a\nlittle longer\nwe hope you enjoyed this video if you\ndid a thumbs up would be really\nappreciated\nhere's a reminder to subscribe to our\nchannel and click on the bell icon for\nmore on the latest
