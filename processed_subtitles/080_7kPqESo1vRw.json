  "text": "data visualization is a crucial step in\nany data analytics project it helps you\nunderstand your data better and draw\nmeaningful conclusions hi everyone\nwelcome to this video tutorial on data\nvisualization full course by simply\nlearn so in this course you will learn\nhow to make sense of data and create\ninteresting visualizations using tableau\npower bi\nexcel r and python we have our\nexperience instructors who will take you\nthrough this course but before we begin\nmake sure to subscribe to the simply\nloan channel and hit the bell icon to\nnever miss an update\nso we will start by learning how to\ncreate reports and dashboards using\ntableau tableau is a powerful business\nintelligence and data visualization\nsoftware that is popularly used in\nseveral industries\nthen we will learn another important\ndata visualization tool that is power bi\nyou will learn how to create charts and\ngraphs in power bi desktop and publish\nreports on power bi servers\nmoving ahead we will learn to create an\nexcel dashboard where we will see how to\ncreate reports using sales data then we\nwill see how to use important\nvisualization packages in r to build\ndifferent charts and graphs\nso we will learn about ggplot and plotly\npackages\nfinally we will look at the important\ndata visualization package in python\nthat is matplotlib so let's get started\nhello and welcome to tableau training\nfor beginners my name is michelle covine\nand i'm with the simplylearn team\ntoday we'll be talking about all the\nthings you need to know to get started\nwith tableau\nso here's our agenda we'll be talking\nabout business intelligence and why it's\nimportant and some bi tools then we'll\ntalk about tableau and why we use\ntableau for business intelligence and do\na quick overview of tableau installation\nthen we'll show you how you can get\nstarted by connecting to data and we'll\ndo an overview of the tableau workspace\nwe'll go a little bit deeper into the\ntableau workspace as we look at\nworksheets and dashboards and we show\nyou how you can ask questions using\nvisualizations we'll look at hierarchy\nand drill down calculated fields we'll\nlook at parameters and sets and finally\nwe'll show you how to build a donut\nchart and a 2d pie chart so what is\nbusiness intelligence companies use\nbusiness intelligence technologies to\ncollect analyze and present data in\norder to create actionable information\ntoday's businesses are always seeking\ninsights about their customers products\nand services\nso businesses are faced with many\nquestions such as how do i know my\ncustomers are happy what would make my\ncustomers stay and how can i increase\nawareness of my products and services\nbusiness intelligence can help you\nanswer those questions when you have a\nquestion about what your customers are\nfeeling what your customers are doing\nwho the customers are and what's the\nbest channel to target them business\nintelligence is a method of transforming\nyour data into these insights and\nmeasurable metrics business intelligence\ntools are designed to make the data flow\nmanageable\nin the age of information tableau is one\nof many tools to help manage the data\nflow and turn data into actionable\ninformation but we also have click and\nsap and oracle you may have heard of\nsome of these let's take a look at some\nof the benefits of tableau as your\nbusiness intelligence tool so why would\nwe use tableau it can be connected to 40\ndifferent data sources the more data\nsources it can connect to it means that\nyou are more likely to get direct access\nto your data it can build interactive\ndashboards with just a few clicks which\ncan help you quickly understand your\ndata and it lets you see your outliers\nthere's also simple analytics built\nright into tableau such as trends and\nforecasting that can help you understand\nyour data on a deeper level tableau has\nbeen a leader in the gartner magic\nquadrant for the last six years and that\nincludes 2018. here we will take a look\nat an overview of the products offered\nby tableau so we have tableau desktop\nwhich is where you do all of your\ndevelopment this is where you connect to\nand build visualizations and dashboards\ntoday we'll be using tableau public\nwhich is a free version of tableau\ndesktop but with some limitations such\nas having no r integration and it can\nonly support up to a million rows of\ndata also any data published here is\nmade public so you can't use this for\nprivate company information then there's\na new tool called tableau prep where you\ncan prepare your data by seeing it\nvisually before you connect and build\nreports there's also tableau online\nwhich is a cloud-hosted version of\ntableau server a place where you can\npublish your dashboards and it enables\nyou to share your dashboards in a secure\nway tableau server has an option to be\non premises so let's just do a quick\ncomparison between building a\nvisualization in excel and building one\nin tableau\nokay so here we have an excel file full\nof data that we will soon connect to and\nuse for some of our demonstration\npurposes\nand you can see that we have information\nabout orders if we wanted to find out\nthe quantity sold and the sum of sales\nfor each region we could do that by\ncreating a pivot table so we'll make it\ni selected my cells we'll make it in the\nnew worksheet\nand here we have the beginnings of a\npivot chart\nand we can grab region and pull it into\nour columns\nand then we'll grab\nsales\nand put it into values\nand then we also want to look at\nquantity and put that into values and\nit's automatically summing up sales and\nquantity but you can choose if you want\nit to be some or not and then we'll take\nour values and put it on rows so that we\ncan see\nsales and quantity\none on top of the other and that's the\nbasics of a pivot chart now let's do a\nsimilar thing in tableau\nokay so we have our connection to the\ndata and tableau automatically splits\nout the dimensions from the measures\nwe'll go into more depth on that later\nbut we can come and grab a region and\nput it onto columns\nand we get a similar thing maybe a\nlittle nicer formatted and then we can\ncome and put quantity\nthere\nif we want to add sales to it we can\ndouble click on sales and we'll have\nquantity and sales one on top of the\nother we can put sales on top by\ndragging quantity\ndown in that box we also have this show\nme dialog box which allows you to\nsee what visualizations you could build\nusing what's already on the screen or\nthe things that you have selected so\nright now we could quickly switch it to\nbar charts and now we can see quantity\nand sales across our region with bar\ncharts or we could switch it to stacked\nbars\nand we can see our quantity across the\nregions if you close that we can see our\nlegend over here and then our sales\nacross the region\nso in tableau we have a lot of really\nquick flexibility to turn just text into\na visualization\nso in summary we can see a side by side\nof what we made using pivot tables in\nexcel and what we made in a similar\namount of time in tableau let's get\nstarted with the tableau installation as\nfor requirements you need windows 7 or\nlater or you need your mac operating\nsystem to be 10.11 or later here are\nsome of the browsers you can use to\ninstall tableau we will be installing\ntableau public today and to do that you\njust google tableau public download and\nclick on that first link and then you\nput in your email address and click\ndownload the app so\nlet's just\nlook up tableau public download\nand it's this first one you can click\ndownload now\nit takes you to the tableau public page\nwhere you can click sign in and create\nan account free\nthis gives you a place to save the\nvisualizations you make but keep in mind\nanything you save on tableau public is\npublic and then you come here and you\nenter your email address and click\ndownload the app and it should give you\nexecutable file\nthat you will download\nand once it's downloaded\nyou should be able to open tableau\npublic so let's go take a look at the\ntableau public opening page\nso this is what tableau public looks\nlike when you first open it on your left\nyou have the different things you can\nconnect to this is more limited in\ntableau public than it is in tableau\ndesktop so if you invest in tableau\ndesktop you have\nmany many things you can connect to you\ncan also connect to data by clicking\nthis drop down connect data piece that's\nespecially useful when you've already\nstarted your visualization then we have\nthe central portion called open this is\nwhere anything that you have opened up\npreviously will show up you can also\nclick open from tableau public and when\nyou have\nmy connections timed out so i need to\nlog in\nbut when you log in\nit says no workbook found try publishing\nfirst this is where you'll see all of\nyour published tableau public dashboards\nover here we have discover and it has\nsome how-to videos um visualization of\nthe day\nwhich is where people who have made\ntableau public visualizations get\nrecognized for their skill and you get\nsome pretty cool ideas when you look\nthere\nso let's get started by connecting to\ndata source we'll click microsoft excel\nand we'll choose our excel file and open\nit up and this is our data source page\nthis shows you the sheets on the excel\nfile and allows you to drag them in so\nthat you can see the data show up this\ngives you a preview of what your data\nwill look like\nyou can see the tableau is starting to\nclassify our fields so anything that has\nabc on it\nshows that that's a column that has\nstrings in it we also have a globe which\nis where tableau has recognized these\nvalues to be geographical\nso we have um state and it's recognized\nthat it contains states it bases it on\nthe keywords that it stores to identify\nif it's geographical and so it takes a\nlook and you've named it city and it\nknows that city is geographical we also\nhave the calendar symbol where it's\nrecognized that it's a date field and we\nalso have row id that shows up with the\nhashtag and it recognizes it's a number\nso now that we have our data source\npulled in we can come here and hit sheet\nwhich is where you start to build your\nvisualization\nlet's take a look at all the different\npieces of this before we go any further\nwe have the data that we're connected to\nup here\nis our orders sheet from the sample\nsuperstore excel sheet we have\ndimensions on top and measures on bottom\nthese are where we're going to get the\nfields to drag and drop here we have our\ncards we'll look more in depth at our\ncards in a moment and these are our\nshelves the column shelf and the row\nshelf\nwhere you can drag things in to make\nchanges happen in the visualization\ncenter we have our show me tabs where\nyou can see we took a brief look at this\nearlier but you can see all the\ndifferent visualizations you can build\nhere\na neat thing about show me is that when\nyou hover\nit'll tell you what types of\nfields you need to build it so\nfor a symbol map try one geographical\nfield\nzero or more dimensions or zero to two\nmeasures and that's how you can build a\ngeographical symbol map\nand when you're done with show me you\njust close it\nlet's take a look here at our sheets so\nwe have sheet one and sheet two a sheet\nis basically just one visualization at a\ntime\nlet's get rid of the extra sheet we have\na dashboard which is where you can pull\nmultiple sheets on to show multiple\nvisualizations at one time\nand then we have what's called the story\nwhich allows you to show\na sequence of visualizations so that you\ncan tell a story\nperfect okay so we saw that tableau is\ncategorizing\nour different fields and it is also\ngiving it a role\nso we have dimensions on top and\nmeasures on bottom\ndimensions contain descriptive values\nsuch as names dates and geographical\ndata you can use dimensions to reveal\ndetails in your data that is qualitative\ndetails we also have measures which\ncontain numeric quantitative values that\nyou can measure measures can be\naggregated and when you drag a measure\nonto the view tableau will apply an\naggregation to that measure is sum by\ndefault\nso let's show this by building what we\nbuilt before\nwe'll grab region and we'll see its four\ndistinct\nvalues as a dimension\nand then we'll double click on quantity\nand we can see the\nnumbers here the measures and you can\nsee here that it is the sum of quantity\nand now we can also double click on\nsales and we can see quantity and sales\nto discuss a little bit more about\ndimensions and measures you can see that\nin general measures are numbers and\ndimensions are not but sometimes like\nrow id it is a number now why would we\nhave a number up here instead of in the\nmeasures so you can tell the difference\nbetween number whether it should be in\nmeasures or it should be in dimensions\nbased on whether you'll need to do any\ncalculations on it or if you would want\nto be able to aggregate it at some time\nso for\nsales if you have\nseveral orders in a day you might want\nto know what the sum of those sales are\nbut if you have several orders in the\nday\nand they're on rows 2 3 4 and 5 you\nmight not want to know the sum of the\nrows so tableau is smart enough that\nwhen it sees id it knows that it belongs\nup in the dimensions now you can switch\nso if row id was actually something you\nwould want to aggregate for some reason\nyou can drag it down to the measures and\nadd it down there\nbut in our case row id isn't something\nthat you want to sum or average can you\nthink of any other numbers that might\nnot show up as a measure that should be\na dimension comment below with your\nanswers as we discussed before\ndimensions are on top measures are on\nbottom and you can see the blue is\nassociated with dimensions and green is\nassociated with measures but it's a\nlittle bit more complicated than that so\ndimensions are qualitative and measures\nare quantitative but blue means we want\nour label to be discrete and green means\nwe want our label to be continuous let's\nmake a new sheet and make a\nvisualization to kind of show this so we\ncan bring on quantity and we're going to\nuse it as a dimension but you can see\neven when it's dimension you can choose\ncontinuous or discrete so right now it's\na dimension but it's green it's a little\nbit different than what you might expect\nand then we'll do sales so now we can\nsee over the different quantities what\nour sales was it has been for this last\nthis period of time that we're looking\nat i believe it's four years so for when\npeople bought three items the total\nsales was\nthat number and you can see that this is\nan axis so it's from 1 to 15. now if we\nchange it from continuous to discrete\nyou can see that 1 is a label 2 is a\nlabel and it's not an axis ranging from\n1 to it doesn't even have 15 because\nthere are no values under 15. these are\njust individual labels so we go back\nit's green again and you can see that\nit's an axis so we have two greens on\nhere so we have two axes and change it\nback to discrete and now we have one\naxes and one set of individual labels\nso let's go back to our sheet three we\nhave\nall of these different\nsales by the different quantity numbers\nand up here we have our sorting when you\nhover it tells you what kind of sorting\nis going to happen so we could sort\nquantity descending by sales so we can\nsee that when they buy three things we\nhave the highest sales\nyou can do the opposite\nwhere it's the\nlowest to the highest\nnumber of sales you can also do sorting\nmore in depth by clicking on the\nquantity and right clicking sort so we\ncould just sort\nby descending or ascending or by sales\nor\nalphabetic\nwhich is\nnot what we want\nyou can choose the field or you can\nmanually change your sorting here\nand now we're back to what we had at the\nbeginning now that we've had an overview\nof how tableau works let's go into a\nlittle more detail\ntableau is very much built on the\npremise of drag and drop\nso\nlet's build a simple visualization\nand talk about\nwhat each of these shelves and marks\ncards specifically do\nso we're going to make a simple chart\nwhich is average sales by region\nso we know we want\nsales\non\nlet's do sales on\nrows now for rows and for metrics since\nthis is continuous like we talked about\nbefore it's making an axes\nfor our sales\nwe also can drag\nregion\nonto columns and it makes one column per\nregion so that's how it works with\ndimensions if you\npull a dimension onto columns you're\nsaying i want one\nblank per column i want one region per\ncolumn so if you wanted to do it by\ninstead of region if you want to remove\nsomething from a visualization you just\npull it back off\nor you can hit undo or control z\ntableau has the benefit of having\nunlimited undos so let's say we wanted\nto bring on city let's say we want one\ncolumn per\ncity and that's what you get and there's\na lot of cities\nso that's what it looks like let's take\ncity back off\ni want one column per\nregion\nand for\nsales\ni want my rose axes\nto show me where sales are great now\nlet's say we want to adjust the color of\nthese bars you can click on color\nand you can select any of them so let's\npick this nice blue or we can pick an\norange\nand that's how you can determine the\ncolor\nbut if you want\nsomething else to determine the color\nyou can take\nregion\nand drag it onto color and now we have\none color per region\nnow with measures again since they're\ncontinuous it's going to be more like a\nscale\nso\nif i want them to be\na different color based on sales and i\npull sales onto color it's going to be\ndarker where there's higher sales and\nlighter where there's lower sales so\nit's continuous\nfrom light to dark\nbut for region\nit is one color per region so they're\ndistinct colors it's not continuous\ngreat um\nlet's say we want to sort this\nbiggest to smallest\nand we can look at size here so if we\nwant to adjust the size manually we can\nclick on it and drag it\nbut if we want the size to be based on\nsomething else\nyou choose a measure for the size so if\nwe want it to be\nwider\nbased on\nsales we will drag sales onto size and\nwe can see that it gets bigger with\nbigger sales you do the same thing\nand replace the sales with profit and\nnow it's bigger if there is bigger\nprofit and drag that back off so you can\ndetermine manually or you can do it with\nyour measures um for label let's say we\nwant the sales on to label now we can\nsee\nthe exact sales\nnumber\nfor each\nregion\nwhat if we wanted the name of the region\nthere as well we can drag region onto\nlabels and we can see sales for the west\nregion\nyou can adjust which one goes on top see\nhow we have two t's here those are both\nlabels\ngreat\ntool tip\nwhen we click on tool tip it'll show us\nwhat's going to happen\nwhen we hover so as i hover here on east\nit says region east sales and that shows\nthe sales amount\num now we talked about\ni'll take my labels back off wanting to\nmake this visualization not for the sum\nof sales but for the average of sales so\nwe will right click on our sum of sales\nhere in the rows hover over measure\nwhich right now is sum and change it to\naverage and we have a different\nresult here so let's sort again and we\ncan see that the south\nregion actually has the highest average\nof sales which was not the case for the\nsum now let's say we want our sum i mean\nour sales to be on the label but look\nit's giving us the sum of sales label so\nwe just do the same thing\nand change it to average\nnow we can see our average on the label\nthe label has some interesting\noptions\nlike you can format this and we could\nsay maybe we want it to be\nall of them to be blue\nand that happens right there\nyou can also choose to only show\nthe minimum and the maximum\nthis becomes handy on\na line chart where you don't want all\nmarks labeled because it gets very messy\nbut you want the tallest and the\nshortest part to be labeled and maybe\nyou just want the tallest so we'll click\nlabel minimum value and remove that\ncheckbox and now we just have the\ntallest value there\nand one card that we haven't used yet is\nthe filters card so\nwe could allow people\nto look at this\nbut only certain regions so what we can\ndo is we can come over to region and\nright click on it and click show filter\nand it will add it to that filters card\nand now we can remove central from the\nmix and just look at those ones you see\nif we remove south the new highest east\nnow has the label but if we put it back\nin south will have the label again if we\ndon't want to have these filters\nwe can pull it off there or if we wanted\nto filter out\nby country oh we just have united states\nso let's not filter by country um but we\ncould pull in\ncategory\nand we have these filters by category\nif we select them all\nthey'll all be there\nand we click show filter and it will\nbring it over here and we can remove our\ntechnology and the south still has the\nhighest for the other two but if we only\ninclude technology\nyou can see the difference there\nso that's the basics of filters\none another thing that i can mention\nhere\nis that you can change the type of mark\nmanually so you saw when we pulled on\nregion and we pulled on sales it\nautomatically made us a bar chart but we\ncould change this to be a line chart and\nyou can see that the color changes\nbecause we told it to based on region if\nwe pull that off\nthen it would be a line chart there\nyou can change it to be a lot of\ndifferent type of visualizations here\nso when you're not using show me to help\ndetermine your graphs you can choose it\nmanually right here\nokay\nnow let's\nlook at\nbuilding a scatter plot so scatter plot\nis when you have a bunch of shapes and\npoints on a visualization with two axes\nthat are both measures\nso if we take\nsales\nand put it on the\ny axis and we take\ndiscount and put it on the x-axis we can\nsee\nour point that represents all of our\ndata with the sum of sales and the sum\nof discount\nand if we wanted to see this per order\nwe'll take order id and put it on to\ndetail now what detail does is it\ndetermines the level that we are\nbuilding our visualization at so\ngrabbing order id and putting onto\ndetail\ngives us all of these little points so\nfor each order what was our sales\nand what was our discount so we have\nout here some outliers that you can find\nvery quickly\nlet's actually do product id\ninstead so i'll put it right over top of\norder id and it will replace it\nnow we see all of our products\nanything that has high sales is up here\nanything that has high discount is over\nhere you can see that it sort of has\na trend\nwhere\nthings with high sales do not have high\ndiscounts which makes sense if we wanted\nto\nknow what\ncategory these products all show up in\nwe could take category\nand put it onto shape\nand now we have three different shapes\nthat tell us the categories tableau has\na cool new highlight feature which\nallows you to show\njust the dimension that you want to see\nbut it leaves the other ones in place so\nfor example if we click on furniture\nfirst we have to turn on the highlight\nfeature and then click on furniture\nand now you can see all of the furniture\nitems popping up in our visualization\nand how they're kind of clustered in\nthis area and the pattern\nfor them when we click on technology\nwe can see their pattern which is a\nlittle bit different so we have them by\nshape\nwith category let's drag category onto\ncolor as well if you remember category\nwill determine the color\nand the shape at this point and so we\ncan kind of see the patterns happening\nthere\nso if we want to see our high discounted\nitems\nthey're all over here and most of the\nthings that are getting\nhigh discounts are office supplies which\nis\ninteresting and then our highest sales\nproduct up here\nnow we could take that product id and\nfind out what that product actually is\nout of our oh look we have product name\nlet's replace product id with product\nname\nand we see that that is a canon image\nclass advanced copier\nso this copier is our big sales person\nand\noffice supplies binders do not give us\nvery many sales and we're highly\ndiscounting them so now you know a\nlittle bit more about the details card\nand the shapes card and about using\nhighlighting\nin tableau\nso\nlet's say\nwe wanted to know\nby subcategory what our profit is like\nwe could grab\nsubcategory and pull it onto columns and\nwe would say we want one column per\nsubcategory\nand then let's grab profit\nand pull it onto rows\nand you can quickly see\nwhich categories\nare profitable and which ones are not so\nwe can also take profit and put it onto\ncolor\nso that you can see that even more\nclearly\nright now it is going from orange to\nblue which is tableau's default if we\nwanted to change\nfrom what color to what color it was\ngoing we have a lot of options in here\nwhen you go to edit colors\nso maybe you wanted to go from red to\nblue\njust to emphasize that the profit that's\nnegative is bad so we can hit apply and\nnow we can see red to blue we have our\ncategories here\nour subcategories here but let's\nseparate it out by category so what i'm\ngoing to do i'm going to take\nsubcategory off\ni'm going to put on category and that's\nmy category and then i'm going to put\nsubcategory on after it so when we put\nit in order like this the order matters\nin tableau so first it breaks it up by\ncategory and then inside of that it\nbreaks it up by subcategory so\nfurniture's all here and then there's\nour subcategories under furniture if we\nwere to move subcategory to the front\nit really doesn't group it appropriately\nbecause first it's breaking out by\nsubcategory and then by category and\nthat's not effective we end up with\nfurniture furniture\nfurniture furniture spread out across\nour visualization so again let's put\ncategory to the front\nand now we have our profit by category\nby sub category\nand we can click\nsort subcategory descending by profit\nand now what it does is within the\nhighest group within each group\nit then sorts it by profit so you can\ntell it's not going to break this group\napart to move tables to the very end\nit's going to keep tables inside of\nfurniture and then it doesn't move\nfurniture to the very end either\nso\nwhat we have here\nis a quick view by category by\nsubcategory how we're doing on profit we\ncan see that\ntables is our biggest drain on profit\nand so if we wanted to improve the\nprofitability of furniture\nmaybe we would\nnot sell tables anymore it's just not\nworking out for us\nanother thing about this visualization\nthat we could do to improve it\nis you can see that there's some of\nthese words are getting cut off so\nwe can right click on this axis and\nclick\nrotate label\nand now you can read the whole word and\nso that's helpful also up here we have\nour title which right now is the same\nname as our sheet\nso if we rename the sheet to\nprofit by\nsub category\nthen it names the title up here so this\nis making it look a little bit better\nand then here we have profit\nand it shows it but without any like\ndollar signs so let's come up here to\nprofit and click format and you can see\nthat we can format the sum of profit\nto be currency\nand\nwe can do a currency by the thousands\nand we can get rid of these decimal\nplaces and now you can see it's just a\nlittle bit nicer a little bit more clear\nmaybe we don't have to have the label\nhere that says\ncategory subcategory so we can hide\nfield labels for columns\nbecause it's pretty clear that these are\ncategories and these are subcategories\nso those are some formatting tips for\nyou formatting in tableau\nis one of those things where there are\njust a lot of different ways you could\nchange things\nso in more in-depth videos especially\nfrom simply learn you'll learn more and\nmore about this\nalso as we are\nbuilding these visualizations if you\nwant to\nhave access to this data set so that you\ncan build along with me just make a\ncomment in the comments below and the\nsimply learn team will send you this\ndata set now we're going to take a look\nat creating a hierarchy in tableau\nso we'll make a new tab and we're going\nto make a sheet\ncalled\nsales\nby product\nand so we will be looking at\nsales as a number\nand let's bring on product name\nnow there are a lot of products names so\nit's going to make sure that you really\nwant to do this i'm going to click add\nall members and now we can see all of\nour products and their sales\noverall time\nso if we sort this we can see our\nhighest sale selling item which we\ndiscovered earlier as the advanced\ncopier and we scroll down to the bottom\nour lowest selling items\nso we have our products and we can group\nthat by sub category\nand you can see i need to put it in the\nfront again\nand by category\nall right i'm going to take product name\nback off and we're going to talk about\nhierarchies so\na product rolls up into a subcategory\nwhich rolls up into a category you can\ncreate a hierarchy by\nlet's start with subcategory and\ndragging it onto category and it's going\nto create a hierarchy we'll call it our\nproduct\nhierarchy\nand now it knows that category is the\nparent to subcategory\nlet's do the same thing by grabbing\nthe product name and putting it\nunderneath subcategory so now it knows\ncategories the parent then there's\nsubcategory and then there's product\nname this allows you to instead of\npulling this off or putting it back on\nyou can bring category on and then you\ncan expand it by pressing this plus\nbutton and now we see but here's our\nsales by category by subcategory\nand then here's our sales\nby category by subcategory by product\nname this is really useful when you're\ncreating a detail section for your users\nand so when somebody wants to know\nlet's say you have\nshow filter for category and a filter\nfor subcategory\nshow filter for subcategory and they're\nlooking at category here and they're\njust like i see technology has the\nhighest sales and i just want to see\ntechnology so i'm going to unclick\nfurniture and office supplies\nlet's put category on top and then so i\njust have technology will i want to see\nwhat has the highest sales inside of\ntechnology and let's sort it\nup phones phones does so i just actually\nwant to look at phones so i'm going to\nremove accessories copiers and machines\nand what has the highest sales inside of\nphones\nand sort it and now i can see quickly\nthe detailed information\nwithout having to change my\nvisualization let's give this\nvisualization a little more depth\nfirst i'll add back in all of our\ncategories and subcategories\nby\nshowing across region\nso we know technology had the highest\nbut how does it look across region now\npart of the point of tableau is to allow\nthe users to read the visualizations\nvery quickly and when you have big\nblocks of text like this it's kind of\nhard to see which one has the highest\nbecause it doesn't quite stand out very\nquickly\nso what we can do\nis take\nsales and drag it onto color\nlet's change our marks to a square and\nnow it's going to color each of these it\ncolors every one of these cells based on\nits darkness for sales this is a little\nbit heavy of a color you can click color\nhere and change the opacity to give it a\nlittle bit\nof a lighter look\njust makes it a little bit see-through\ngreat so now it's a lot easier to see\nthat the west seems to have the highest\nsails\nand that technology in the east is the\nvery highest so now when we\ndrill into subcategory it keeps that\ncoloring and we can see more in depth\nand quicker that phones has the highest\nacross most of them it's not quite the\nhighest in the west because chairs is\nthe highest in the west there's one\nplace in tableau where hierarchies are\nbuilt in and that's in dates so dates in\ntableau can be very complex because they\nallow\nvery complex visualizations so we will\nnot go into depth about dates at this\ntime but let's take a look at how they\nwork for hierarchies so we have order\ndate that we can pull onto columns here\nand you can see that it's blue meaning\nthat it's discrete so each one of these\nis a header instead of it being an axis\nacross the top\nnow let's drag\nprofit\nonto rows\nso now we can see our profit\nover time for each of these years\nand tableau has some hierarchies built\ninto dates already so when i click this\nplus on\ncolumns it'll split it out into quarters\nso this is a header and these are all\nsub headers underneath that header\nbecause it is distinct um and discrete\nright now instead of continuous so it's\nsplit out year year year year and\nquarters quarters quarters quarters this\nallows you to quickly compare quarter\none across all of the years and quarter\ntwo across all the years and quarter\nfour across all the years\nanother way you could add some more\ndetail to this is by taking maybe\ncategory and pulling out a color and now\nwe have one line for each category and\nwe can see that a drop in technology\nis a big part of the responsibility for\nthat drop we were seeing in quarter 2 of\n2016. so let's take that back off and\nlet's take quarter back off\nand let's explore continuous dates so\nhere in dates we have our top section of\ndates and then you see it repeats and we\nhave the bottom section of dates so\nwe've got year but we also have year\nhere\nquarter and quarter now the top ones are\nall discrete and when i change it to a\nbottom one year same thing same here it\nchanges it to be green and now it's\ncontinuous\nso now instead of this being a header\nfor 2013 and a header for 2014 it's an\naxis so the difference here is when i\npress the plus and then changes it to\nquarter instead of adding quarter to\nyear now it's doing quarter four each\nyear and making one continuous line and\nwe can keep going and drill down to\nmonth\nyou can go pretty far\nnow when we add category as color\nwe get our three lines for the three\ncategories and we also have highlighting\nturned on here still so when we click on\ntechnology we can highlight technology\nwith the others in the background so we\ndon't lose the context of the other\ncategories\nlet's take that back off\nnext let us talk about calculated fields\nso we'll make a new sheet and we're\ngoing to create our first calculated\nfield we can create a calculated field\nby clicking this arrow which gives us\nsome options and clicking create\ncalculated field or we can come and\nclick in the white space below\ndimensions or below measures and we\nright click and click create calculated\nfield let's name it\nprofit ratio so this is for if we wanted\nto create a visualization that showed\nthe profit ratio but we don't have that\nmeasure readily available to us to bring\nin fields for our calculation you can do\nit in one of two ways one is to start\ntyping it\nand it will start auto prompting you for\nthe different measures or for different\ncalculations or\nvalues you can use or you can come and\ndrag it in so if we want profit and we\nwant sales if we do profit divided by\nsales that is a profit ratio\nunaggregated\nokay and let's make a second calculated\nfield we could come here and click\nduplicate\nand that will duplicate our field but i\njust want to start over again so i'll\nclick create calculated field\nand i will call it profit\nratio\naggregated\nand in this one we're going to do sum\nclick\nof profit\nclick divided by\nsum of sales\nokay so now what's the difference\nbetween profit ratio\naggregated and profit ratio on\naggregated how will those behave\ndifferently in tableau let's look at\nthis by looking at a single\norder\nso first let's bring on all the orders\nand all the products\nunder that order and let's look at this\norder\nso\ni want to filter this whole dashboard to\nonly this order so i can right click on\nit and click keep only\nthat creates a filter up here\nthat only has that box checked\nand if i want to get rid of this later\ni can just pull it right off of filters\nand everything will come back but i want\nit so keep only\nand now let's take a look at profit\nratio aggregated i double clicked on it\nand i added it here and profit ratio\nunaggregated again double clicking\nanother side by side let's give us a\nlittle bit more room\nso when i dragged that out it gave us\nmore room so we could see them side by\nside and the entire titles okay so i\nchose to look at one order and these\nproduct names because the combination of\norder and product name is unique one\nperot we know that tableau will\naggregate the data up to the lowest\nlevel in the visualization and i brought\nit all the way down to the lowest level\nof the data source so we have no\naggregation right now\nso when we're looking at it without any\naggregation these two calculations are\nthe same\nprofit ratio aggregated let's look at\nthat again we'll click edit and that's\nthe one where we sum profit and some\nsales before we divide\nand then we've got profit ratio\nunaggregated so let's also look at\nprofit and look at sales this is a\ntechnique that i use when i'm trying to\nunderstand how my calculated fields are\nworking try to break it down to the\nlowest level possible and see if it's\ndoing what i expect\nso we've got profit and we've got sales\nnow both of them are at\n0.5 or 50 and that's because profit is 8\nand sales 616 for adam's telephone\nmessaging\nnow\nlet's take off product name\nwhen we take off product name we can see\nthat they start to vary we've got profit\nratio aggregated and profit ratio\nunaggregated so here we have profit and\nsales the profit ratio should be profit\ndivided by sales so let's open up a\ncalculator\nand make it a little smaller\nso if we take profit at 219\nand divided by sales at 508.6\nwe get\n0.4 not 1.8 so where does this 1.8 come\nfrom\nwell let's put product name back on here\nwhat happens is with profit ratio\naggregated it sums up the profit and\nthen divides it by the sum of sales so\nthat's what we did when we took off\nprofit ratio and aggregated we had the\nsum of profit and divided it by the sum\nof sales which is what we want profit\nratio unaggregated however\ndoes the calculation profit divided by\nsales and then\nsums it afterwards you can see it right\nhere it's the sum of profit ratio on\naggregated so it makes this calculation\nand then\nit adds up 0.5 plus 0.5 plus 0.3 plus\n0.5 and that's where we get our 1.8\nwhich is what we see\nwhen we pull off product name 1.8 so for\nmost calculations you want to do profit\nratio aggregated\nwhere you determine how it's aggregated\nbefore you do the calculation\nso let's remove profit ratio on\naggregated\nand delete it let's go to profit ratio\naggregated\nand just call it profit ratio\nperfect now we no longer need anything\nthat we have on our visualization right\nnow so let me show you a quick trick to\nclear the board tableau has this button\nup here which is called clear sheet you\ncan also do on windows alt shift\nbackspace and you just click clear sheet\nand it will start you over with that\nsheet and that really helps when you've\ndragged a bunch of things on and really\nmade a mess when you're trying things\nout okay so we're going to build a\nvisualization and we're going to look at\nregion and we're going to look at it by\nprofit ratio and so now we have this bar\nchart by profit ratio let's color this\nby region we can also pull on profit and\nsales and we can see all three of them\nside by side split out by region\nnow let's say we also wanted to see\neach region\nby sales per customer so let's create\nsome calculated fields that will help us\ndo that let's create our first\ncalculated field\nthat's going to get us a count of\ncustomers\nlet's call it total\nnumber of customers\nand so we have customer name and\ncustomer id let's do\ncount distinct\nof customer id and that gives us the\ntotal number of customers\napply so right now we could take total\nnumber of customers and see which\ncategories have the highest number of\ncustomers perfect but that's just one\npart of our calculation we want to see\ntotal sales divided by total number of\ncustomers so let's make our second\ncalculated field and we're going to call\nit\nsales per\ncustomer\nso we're going to do our sum\nof sales which we can drag in\nand divide that by\ntotal number of customers now you see\nthat calculated field we just made pops\nup inside of our calculation\ndialog box and we hit apply\nand it shows up so we hit ok and let's\nreplace\ntotal number of customers\nwith\nsales per customer and now we can see\nour sales per customer ratio and which\nones have the highest or for this next\npart i'm going to make a couple of\nvisualizations in a row that all applied\nto the same information using a couple\nof different tactics so\nfirst let's use show me so i want to\nlook at\nregion and sales for this visualization\nso i'm going to control click\nregion\nafter i clicked sales so one more time\ni'm going to\nclick on sales and i'm going to control\nclick region\nand i'm going to click show me and it's\ngoing to give me all of the different\nvisualizations i could make with region\nand sales let's pick\ntree map\ngreat so now we have a tree map that\nshows us our sales\nby region\nand we have the size and the color of\nthe box is both sales so let's say we\nwanted the size to be sales but the\ncolor to be profit so let's grab profit\nand drag that on to sales so now we can\nsee our most profitable to our least\nprofitable let's\nedit our colors and we're going to\nchange it from red to blue diverging red\nto blue but let's go to advanced and\nmake the center number\nzero\nthis means that it will never be red\nunless it's less than zero so let's hit\napply so it's all blue and if anything\never goes negative then it will be red\nokay let's call this sheet\nsales\nprofit by region\nperfect\nnow we're going to start using our\ngeographical\nfields so we have state city country and\npostal code let's double click on state\nand see what happens\nawesome so it is\ngenerated these two fields tableau has\ngenerated longitude and latitude for us\nand it's been able to recognize the\nstates in the united states and where\nthey're located and given it a longitude\nand latitude\nso next we will\nlook at sales\nby state by double clicking on sales and\nwhat it's done\nwas change the size of the dot based on\nsales now i think i'm going to move\nsales from size to color\nand it has automatically changed it to a\nfilled map instead of dots on a map\nperfect so now we can see the states\nwith the\nbiggest amount of sales let's put it\nback onto size and we have our circles\nagain\nlet's put sales onto size not stayed on\nto size and we have our circles again\nbut let's make them a little bit bigger\nthese two marks on the tableau size line\nare to give you an idea of how big and\nhow small you should go before it gets\ntoo difficult to see so when we go\nbigger than the bigger line it detects\nthat you're getting close to having\noverlap\nbut it's up to you as the builder okay\nso we have size for\nsales again and for profit onto color\nagain so you can see\nanything that is more profitable is\ndarker and anything that is less\nprofitable\nor less than zero in this case is orange\nlet's do what we did with color before\nchange it to\nred blue diverging and set our center\npoint to zero okay so now we know that\nif anything is red it was negative in\nprofit perfect let's name this sheet\nsales\nprofit\nby state\ngreat now let's look at sales and profit\nby category so we have category and\nwe've made columns so\nthis is when we drag something to the\ncolumns shelf just remember we want one\ncolumn per category\nand let's double click on sales and it's\ngoing to put it into text and that's not\nwhat i want so let's take sales and drag\nit onto rows and it automatically makes\na bar chart\nso now we have one bar with the axis of\nsales for furniture office supplies and\ntechnology\nnow let's\ntake profit and also put it on\nrows so now we have two bar charts one\nfor sales and one for profit we can\nchange which one is a bar and which one\nis maybe a bubble chart\nby clicking on its appropriate marks\ncard so if we want to change them both\nwe can click on all and change them both\nto maybe circles and you can see how\nthey go up and down\nbut if we want to just change\none of them let's put those back to\nautomatic we'll go to profit and change\nthat one to\nthe circles so now we can see\nthose profit numbers and if we want them\nto be overlaid on the same area\nwe would right click on profit the\nsecond measure on the rows and click\ndual axis so now let's put them onto the\nsame axis you can see that their axes\nare not lined up let's go to sales and\nchange it back to\na bar\nso now we have two charts occupying the\nsame space one of them is a bar chart\nand one of them is a bubble chart and we\ncan see our sales versus our profit at\nleast they're not the same amount of\ndollars obviously but we can see a\nhigher\nsales and a higher profit we also have\nmedium sales and a medium profit we have\na medium sales but a really low profit\nand it's interesting to see that\ncontrast so let's rename this sheet\nas\nsales\nprofit\nby category\nand\nfinally we're going to make our details\nsheet so we're going to go down to\nsubcategory level and bring it onto rows\nand remember subcategory can expand out\nto the actual products let's bring that\nback in and we're going to bring sales\nonto columns which makes us a sales bar\nchart and profit onto columns which\nmakes us a profit bar chart now let's\ncolor them by their appropriate\nindividual color so we'll go to the\nsales marks card and drag sales onto\ncolor\nnow sales is colored by sales we'll do\nthe same thing here we did before we'll\ngo red blue diverging\n[Music]\nand make the center\nzero we actually don't have to do that\nfor sales because sales will never be\nnegative but it's pretty important for\nprofit so we'll go to the profit marks\ncard and take profit onto color\nand do the same thing there\nwe have\nred blue diverging\nadvanced center is zero great\nso now if it's negative it will be there\nso let's sort this\nby profit and so both of them have\nsorted with profit in mind and we can\neasily see our subcategories that have a\nnegative profit\nrename this\nand we'll call it our details sheet\nso now we have these four visualizations\nthat all have to do with similar\ninformation\ni think i want these bigger on the\nstates so we'll just keep making that\nbigger perfect now we're going to make\nour first dashboard so for our dashboard\nwe have\ninformation over here that shows you\nwhat sheets you can bring on these get a\nlittle bit more complex so they'll be\ncovered in more in-depth type of videos\nand then we have our size so\nwe could make a range of sizes based on\num maybe what you're viewing this on but\nwe're just going to change it to a fixed\nsize\nand we're going to make it\n1400\nby\n1000 and this is our\ndashboard size so let's bring on sales\nprofit by region\nsales and profit by state now a map\nneeds a little bit more horizontal space\nthan region does let's bring sales and\nprofit by category underneath the region\nand the detail underneath the state give\nour map more space again perfect\nnow tableau has this neat feature called\nuses filter so you can click use this\nfilter here and now if i click on any of\nthese it will filter the other\ndashboards based on these features so if\ni just want to look at the south and i\nclick on south it zooms into all my\nsouth states now my categories have\nupdated to be just the south ones and my\ndetails have updated as well so\nwe could see that central\nhas pretty big sales you know bigger\nthan the south but the profit is lower\nthan the south so we can click on\ncentral and focus on central\nlet's use\nthat uses filter\non all three of these\ndashboards that lead us up to the detail\nso building a quick dashboard like this\nlet's make this taller would allow you\nto do some sort of analysis such as\nlet's take a look at central because\nthey have relatively high profits but\nlow sales so we click on central and\nthen we see oh man texas is having a\nreally hard time so let's click on texas\nand now we're seeing in texas that we\nhave negative profit in these categories\nso we can control click on furniture and\noffice supplies and we can see all of\nour products that are really just\nkilling us in texas all of our\nsubcategories and if we want to go\ndeeper into products we'll just click\nthat plus sign and now we see all the\nproducts and we'll sort again\nand we can see all the products by\nsubcategory that are really just killing\nus\nand are maybe not worthwhile to make\nanymore so we're gonna have to\nreconsider making the 3.6 cubic foot\ncounter height office refrigerator at\nleast for texas it's not very helpful\nthere and then when you\nback out of that subcategory section\nyou can also click\nsomewhere neutral in the dashboard or\nclick on each thing that you had\nselected to unselect it and go back to\nthe main part of your visualization and\nstart it all over again now let's move\non and take a look on how to create\nparameters and sets so new sheet\nand let's make a quick visualization\nthat will apply our parameters and our\nsets too\nso let's take a look at all of our\ncustomers by their sales and let's sort\ncustomer name descending by sales great\nso now we're going to make a parameter\nthat will allow the user of the\ndashboard to choose how many customers\nthey want to see how many of our top\ncustomers that they want to see\nso let's click this down arrow and click\ncreate parameter\nand we will name it\ntop and customers\ngreat we're going to make it an integer\nand we're going to give them the option\nto choose the number of customers within\na range our low is going to be 5 so\nwe'll let them see 5\nor up to 20\nand we're going to let them skip with\nstep size of 5. let's start their\ncurrent value right in the middle with\n10.\nokay so now if you want to see how this\nparameter looks you can come down to\nparameters before we only had dimensions\nand measures on the left side of our\ntableau workspace but now we have\nparameters that has appeared once we\ncreate a parameter we can right click on\nthe parameter and click show parameter\ncontrol and we can see our top end\ncustomers right now our parameter\ncontrol isn't built into any of our\nvisualizations but you can see how it\nworks we allow them to go down to five\nand\nup to\n20 with steps of five great now we're\ngoing to create a set a set is a custom\nfield that defines a subset of data\nbased on some conditions so the set\nwe're going to build is going to be\nbased on customer name so when you right\nclick on customer name you can come down\nand click create hover on create and\ncreate a set with so far when we created\na parameter and a calculated field you\nclicked here\nwith this down arrow and you saw create\ncalculated field and create parameter\nbut it's not there a set has to be based\non an existing field so you come and you\nclick on the field you want it to be\nbased on and then hover on create and\nyou see set\nso here's how we can create a set let's\nname it\ntop and\ncustomers\nby sales so we're going to allow them to\nselect the top end customers and have\nthat select our top customers by sales\nso we want this set to include anything\nthat is in the top however many they\ndefined by the parameter\nby sales so you can come over here to\ntop\nand change it to by field we want it to\nbe top but not just top static 10 we're\ngoing to click here and our parameter\nshows up so it's going to be top top end\ncustomers\nand then you can choose\nanother field here\nfor it to be defined by and it's sales\nand we want it to be by sum of sales if\nwe wanted it to be by\nthe average profit we can come here and\nclick profit and change this to average\nand now we would see our top end\ncustomers by average profit\nbut we want sales and some\nokay so we've created our set and we can\ndrag it on to rows to see how it works\nand we can see these are our top 10\ncustomers by their sales and we have\nthis in slash out\nthat's generated by our set so if we\ntake our set\nfirst let's see how this line moves when\nwe change our number here so right now\nit's 10 when we move it up we see our\nline moves down to include the top 15\nand now we can quickly see our top 20.\nwe'll go back to 10\nand let's grab the set and drag it onto\nour filters so now we have filtered the\ndata down to our top 10. if this were\napplied to a dashboard this would allow\nthe end user to see the top 10 quickly\nand then maybe expand it out to the top\n20 if they're interested in that\ninformation now let's move on to\ncreating a donut chart so a donut chart\nis basically a pie chart with a white\ncenter so let's start by building a pie\nchart which in tableau is pretty easy\nespecially if you use show me so let's\ncreate a pie chart\nfor each category\nby sales so you're going to click\ncategory and then we're going to control\nclick sales so we have them both\nselected we'll come over to show me and\nclick\npie and there we have our pie chart\nwe'll close show me let's come up here\nand click entire view so we see our pie\nvery clearly here if we wanted to have\none pie for each region we can take\nregion\nand drag that onto columns so we have\none column for each region and then one\npi for each of them you can see that the\npi varies in size based on sales as well\nas the angle is for sales so east has\nmore sales in general than south\nand this helps you to see that\ntechnology\nhas smaller sales in the south than it\ndoes in the east so i recommend keeping\nif you're going to make pie charts\nallowing the size of the pie chart to be\naffected as well as the angle by\nwhatever measure you're using but for\nour purposes for donut charts we're\ngoing to want them to all be the same\nsize so we took sales off of\nsize and now we have all of our pie\ncharts the same size now we're going to\nmake what's called a dual axis chart and\nto make a dual axis chart we have to\nhave two axes so let's grab\nnumber of records and we'll grab it and\ndrag it to rows and we will change it\nfrom sum to minimum and that's because\nevery record will have a minimum number\nof rows of one and then they all end up\non the same axis great and now we're\ngoing to make a second number of records\nby minimum and we can do that by doing\nthose steps again by dragging number of\nrecords up here and changing it to\nminimum again\nor a quick trick that i can show you is\nif you want to\nduplicate anything you have on the chart\nhere you can just hit control and then\nclick and drag it and it will duplicate\nit so if you wanted your number of\nrecords to also be down here onto your\ndetails or on your labels you can\ncontrol click it and then leave it there\ngreat so now we have our two axes and we\nhave our two marks cards that each\naffect their own\nset of visualizations so let's go to\nthis top one affects these so let's show\nthat by changing the size\nand it's made these bigger and this\nbottom one affects these and we'll do\nthat by changing it to\ncircle so now each of these are a circle\nlet's take category off of color and we\ncan take some of sales off of detail and\nlet's change the color to white\nand now we're going to put this white\ncircle on top of our pie chart by\nclicking here on our second measure\nand clicking dual axis and now it's got\nthem lined up one on top of the other\nand we have our donut chart so if we\nwant our donut\nslices to be a little thinner we can\nchange the size of our inner circle and\nmake it bigger\nperfect and so now we have one pie chart\nfor each region one doughnut chart for\neach region and if we wanted to take\nthis header and put it inside of our pie\nchart what we can do is take region and\nput it on the label for the circle and\nit's putting it down here you can come\nand edit that by clicking on label and\nchanging its alignment so let's put it\nin the middle\nperfect so now we can see\nour header here so we don't need it down\nhere anymore you can right click and\nclick\nshow header and it hides that header we\nalso don't want to see our labels for\nour axes so we right click and click\nshow header there and now we just see\nour pies\nso to get how the number of sales here\nfor each of them let's go to\nremember our pie marks card and let's\ntake our sales and add it to label so\nnow each of our slices of pie\ncan tell you how much sales they have if\nyou take the sales here that's on label\nright click and click format we can\nchange that to currency\nand let's get rid of our decimal places\nperfect now close formatting and let's\nsay we want the total amount of sales to\nbe in the middle here with central so we\ngo back to affecting our circle grab\nsales drag it to label\nso now we have four doughnut charts\nformatted to allow us to quickly see the\nsales numbers for each segment and also\nfor the donut as a whole you can also\nchange the colors the tableau selects\nfor each slice by coming to the marks\ncard that has color for the pie so\ncategory color and clicking edit colors\nand you could change it to any of these\nautomatic ones\nor if you double click on one it gives\nyou all of the options for colors that\nyou could possibly want there's also\nseveral different palettes you could\nchoose from so let's say we like this\none and you can just click assign\npalette and it will grab those off of\nthere those look very similar to what we\nhave already so i'm going to pick a\ndifferent one\nand click assign palette click apply\nand this allows you to make some color\nchanges and you fit your business a\nlittle bit more\nspecifically\nperfect let's say\nwe make our\npies bigger\ncrease that size\nand we'll also increase the center size\noh not that much perfect\nnow we'll use a similar technique to\ncreate the two-dimensional pie chart\na two-dimensional pie chart can be used\nso that you can show um two pie charts\nat the same time um or a pie chart\nthat's kind of split up by different\ncategories this has been\navailable in some other tools and\ntableau can do it too so let's just\ndemonstrate that we're going to start\nagain by creating our\ngeneric category by sales so with\ncontrol click sales we come over to show\nme and click pie and it makes our pie\nfor us it remembers the colors that you\nhave determined in other pages so that's\na nice feature again let's make it\nentire view so we can see our pie nice\nand big and now we're going to\ncreate our dual axis again so we grab\nnumber of records put it on rows and see\nhow it adds an axis but each one of\nthese categories has a different value\nfor the number of records however they\nhave the same minimum\nvalue for number of records and it puts\nthem all right back onto the same spot\ngreat and then we will control click and\ndrag to make our two axes\nlet's come to our top one\nand make it bigger that affected both of\nthem because we still have sales on size\nfor both of them\nso sales is affecting the size of the\npie chart as well as the size of the\nangles so let's take sales off of size\nfor both of them\nand make the second pie chart a little\nsmaller perfect now let's also affect\nour second pie chart by having the color\ndefined by region instead of defined by\nsales let's talk about how i'm replacing\nit with region so you could change the\ncolor by dragging region onto color and\nthat replaces it or let's go back and we\ncan drag region right on top of the\nthing we're trying to replace and it\nwill replace it there\ngreat so now we have the smaller circle\nthat's going to go on top split up by\nregion with the angle defined by sales\nand the category is on the top one with\nthe angle defined by sales let's pick\nsome nicer colors\nmaybe we'll use the same palette we used\nfor\ncategory\nthis one this one seems right but we'll\npick different ones than those three so\nwe click on the one we want to change\nand click on the color we want to change\nit to i'm just gonna keep following\nthis write down\napply great and then we\nput it on top of the other one by\nclicking dual axes now sometimes it's\neasier to see these when they have a\nborder so we can come to color we click\nborder and add maybe some black lines\nto allow you to see the inner pie\nseparate from the outer pie maybe\nour border could have white lines how\ndoes that look\nand we can make them both bigger like we\ndid before\nwhoa not that big\nand you can also add labels like we did\nbefore\nwe'll take sales onto our labels here\nand you can see that hovering allows you\nto see all the information you need now\none more thing so while we like to hide\nthis axis\nwe'd also like to maybe hide this grid\nline that's occurring so you can click\nright click and format and let's go to\nour lines\nthat change that zero line to none\nperfect get rid of some of the clutter\non this visualization i still feel like\nthis outer pie should be a little bigger\nand we want to clean up our tool tip so\nit doesn't have min number of records in\nit this piece should be 100 behind the\nscenes so we can come to tool tip right\nas you click on it it'll pop up with\neverything that's in your tool tip and\nwe're just going to erase\nmid number of records i erased too much\nyou need to leave your angle brackets\nokay and now this piece of\nthe pie no longer has that the inner one\nlet's do that there too\nmin number of records remove that right\nout\nand there you have it a two-dimensional\npie chart and here are our donut charts\nthis demonstration goes to show you that\neven when tableau doesn't have\nvisualization you're looking for in\ntheir basic show me options you can\nstill get to it so donut charts aren't\nincluded up here and neither is a\ntwo-dimensional pie chart but without\ntoo much extra work we can make it\nhappen\nthese visualizations are a little bit\nmore complex than your everyday\nvisualizations and so i recommend going\nthrough this tutorial with the data set\nand following along if you want access\nto the data set just comment below and\nthe simply learn team will get back to\nyou also comment below with any\nquestions you have\nat this point in the presentation we're\ngoing to put together some dashboards so\nfirst let's build our worksheets for\nthis dashboard we're going to build a\nworksheet\ncalled\nsales by\nyear which adds the name up here and\nwe're going to\ntake our order date and drag it onto\ncolumns and now we want this to be a\ncontinuous axis so we're going to change\nit to our continuous year and now we\nhave an axis and we're going to look at\nsales\nso now we have our sales by year if we\nwant labels on each of these dots we can\ndrag sales onto\nlabels and if we want to have different\ncolor lines for each region for example\nwe can drag region onto color\nand that splits our lines up\ninto the different regions and gives us\na legend over here perfect now we're\ngoing to duplicate this sheet by right\nclicking down here and clicking\nduplicate now we have sales by year two\nlet's rename it to\nprofit\nby year\nand then let's drag profit right over\ntop of sum of sales\nso that it replaces it with profit now\nit's been replaced with profit and all\nthese different data points are here\nhowever it's still showing the title of\nsome of sales and that can be very\nconfusing so always make sure that your\nlabels are consistent with your data so\nlet's take profit and drag it over top\nof the type labels as well that's more\nconsistent with our axis\nso now we have sales by year and we have\nprofit by year\nlet's do a couple of things to clean\nthese up\nlike\nright click here\ngo format and we'll change our numbers\nto\ncurrency\ncustom\nand now it's marked as dollars\none thing you can do in tableau is let's\nundo that\nsince\nsales is going to be dollars pretty much\neverywhere we use it we can define our\ndefault property for these numbers so\nwhen we right click on the measure here\nyou can go to default properties and you\nhave the options to change the defaults\nfor any of these things and we're going\nto change our number format\nchange it to\ncurrency custom\nno decimal places hit ok and that also\nhas updated this sheet now that only\nworks on places where you haven't\nspecifically defined it to be formatted\ndifferently so we could still define it\nto be different here on this sheet than\nit is on any other sheet\nlet's do the same thing for profit\nchange our default\nproperties to\nthe same thing great now let's build our\ndashboard\nwe're going to call this\nour\noverall dashboard\nchange our\nsize\nthis size is a personal preference of\nmine i think it fits nicely\non the laptops that i use and that is\nused by most of our customers and let's\ndrag sales by year now watch what\nhappens when i drag it on here it brings\nsales by year but it also brings the\nlegend\nfor the region that was created the same\nthing should happen with profit by year\nit's detected that the same legend is\nbeing used so it didn't bring over a\nsecond legend and we have highlighting\nturned on let's see if this works for\nboth charts we click on central and you\nsee it highlights central in both charts\nthat's great so now we have a dashboard\nshowing us profit by year and sales by\nyear but let's say we want to be able to\nfilter this dashboard to just maybe one\ncategory so let's go back to our sales\nby year sheet\nand let's drag category\nonto filters\nand now it's going to let us select\nwe're going to select all\nand hit ok and then right click on\ncategory and click show filter so now it\nis over here\nand we're going to do\na similar thing on profit by year but\nwe'll do the shortcut where you come\nover here to category you right click on\nit and you just click show filter and it\nputs it here and it puts it here\nso now we have\na filter here for category\nand a filter here for category\nand so when we go to overall\nwe can come to our\ndrop down here more options\nhover over filters and you can see\ncategory now here's an interesting thing\nthat we'll see\neven though we have a category filter on\nboth charts when i take furniture out\nyou can see only sales by year changed\nand profit by year stayed the same now\nwhy would that be\nthat's because we have two different\nfilters for category one on the sales\nworksheet and one on the profit by year\nworksheet i'll show that\nby clicking here\ngoing to filters\nand grab category now we have category\nthat will affect\nprofit by year and not sales by year\nthat's not what we want we want one\nfilter to affect them both so\nlet's back it up a bit\ntake these back off let's go to profit\nby year now we're going to take off\ncategory\nlet's go to sales by year and we're\ngoing to say we want this same filter to\naffect both worksheets so we're going to\nright click here hover over apply to\nworksheets and click selected worksheets\nnow we select sales by year is selected\nand we select profit by year okay so\nwhen we go to\nthe profit by year\nsheet\nyou can see that it now has category on\nthere let's go to overall let's come\nhere\nfilters category and now we have a\nfilter\nthat affects both worksheets\nthere we go let's format this filter a\nlittle bit we'll come to more options\nand we're going to select we want them\nto be able to select multiple values\nstill but let's do it in a drop down\nso now\nyou still have those options\nbut it is a little bit more compact\nlet's do\na couple more filters so we can do by\ncategory\nlet them filter out regions\nlet's do it the the shorter way right\nclick\nshow filter there it is\napply to worksheets\nselected worksheets\nboth of these\nokay\ndashboard\nfilters and by region\nmultiple values drop down\nand let's let them\nchange their\ntime selection so this one's a little\nbit different since we've already\ndetermined that we wanted year and we\nwanted it to be continuous filters for\ncontinuous\nfields are a little bit different than\nfilters for\nthese discrete fields and that's because\ncontinuous fields are a range instead of\njust a list so we don't list out a\ncontinuous field we make a range for it\nso we've already defined that we want it\nto be continuous year and if i come over\nhere\nand click on right click order date and\nclick show filter it's doing discrete\nyear by default\nso\nremove filter if you drag order date\nonto filters\nit lets you pick what you want it to\nlook at\num let's come up here to year that's\nalready marked as continuous and click\nshow filter and now it is year but it's\nbased on a range and we have this slider\nand you can see how that slider affects\nour visualization\nlet me show you a trick to make this\napply to both not a trick but just if\nyou have not applied it to both\nworksheets but you already added it to\nthe visualization see it's here but it's\nonly affecting one worksheet you can\nchange\nthe worksheets\nsettings right on the filter instead of\nhaving to go to\nthe worksheet where the filter exists\nand it will only give you the options of\nthe worksheets that are on the dashboard\nso there we have it\nnow it affects both and now we have our\noverall dashboard\nnow let's say you want to be able to see\nthe total sales on this chart as well as\nthe sales split up by\neach of the regions we can do that as\nwell so let's go back to our sales sheet\nas a quick tip you can go to the sheet\nby clicking this go to sheet button here\nor here in the event that you want to go\nto a sheet but you don't want to scroll\nback and forth to find where it is so go\nto sheet now we're going to do a dual\naccess chart again like we showed\nearlier and i'm going to control\nclick and drag\nso now we have sum of sales twice\nthis marks card affects the top one so\nwe can see that by if i change the\nopacity\nhow it changes the color right here this\nis the top one\nand this marks card is the bottom one\nand we're going to remove region\noff of color and that makes our combined\none line again perfect now if we want\nthis to be on the same space as this we\nright click here the second measure in\nthe rows section and click dual axis\nso let's put it right on top i can see\nthis versus this now if we wanted to on\nhover show that this is overall sales we\ncan click on tool tip region is missing\nbecause we don't have it with the color\nby region anymore so we'll erase that\nand put\noh we don't want it to be orange let's\nmake it black\noverall sales okay so when you hover\nhere it says overall sales so we can see\nthe difference easily let's make it um a\nlittle bit more of a color that'll stand\nout just a little darker than the others\nperhaps\nso when we go back to our work alright\ndashboard we can see sales and we can\nsee our overall sales let's do the same\nthing for profit by year\ngo to sheet\nand\ncontrol\ndrag\nrelease we'll go to our marks card for\nthis second sheet and pull off region\nmake it darker\nchange our tool tip\nnot orange\noverall\nprofit\nokay\nand right click\ndual access there we go now i forgot to\ndo one thing on the last dashboard when\nyou make a dual access dashboard it\ndoesn't necessarily\nsync up these axes and so this axis over\nhere is for the overall line and this\naxis over here is for the region line\nso if we want it to stay that way we\nshould\nedit our axes and instead of calling it\njust profit over here\nwe'll change it to overall profit\nand over here\nprofit\nby region just so that it's clear which\naxis goes to the which one\nor\nyou can come here and click synchronize\naxes so it's very clear that this is\nmuch bigger than these\nand if you synchronize the axes\nlet's go back before we named him\nokay synchronize the axis then we don't\nneed both of these headers so we can\ncome here and click show header and we\njust have the one let's do the same\nthing on sales by year\nsynchronize\nalways good to make sure that your axes\nare either synchronized or well labeled\nand let's hide it let's see what it\nlooks like now\ngreat\nokay one thing to keep in mind\nwhen we do\nfilter\nto just one region\nthe lines are going to end up at the\nsame spot\nif we filter to 2\nthen it's only the sum of those two\nso\nperhaps the header overall sales and\noverall profit isn't quite accurate\nbecause it isn't overall necessarily\nwhen we have it filtered um why does\nthis happen\nwhy doesn't this line always show the\ntotal no matter what you select here\nwell that's because this filter applies\nto the whole dashboard so it filters\nthis line to those regions just as much\nas it filters these lines\nso i'm going to remove out that tooltip\nline because it could be a little\nmisleading\nlet's continue on and make a dashboard\nthat digs a little bit more into sales\nspecifically great so we'll make our\nfirst sheet we'll call it\nsales by region\nand we're going to make another pie\nchart so\nlet's do it using show me we'll click on\nregion\nand then we will control click on sales\nopen up show me click pi let's close it\nagain great so now we have the sales by\nregion pi we'll make it the entire view\nand when you hover you can see that it's\nshowing us sales in dollar amounts now\nit would be\nmore\nlike a pie for it to be percentages so a\nlot of pies each of these slices is\nshown as a percentage of the whole\nat 100\nso let's come here to our slice size\nwe'll right click on it and we're going\nto use what's called a quick table\ncalculation\nand change it to percent of total so now\nwhen you hover you can see that the west\nis 31\nof the pie\ngreat\nlet's also label each of these slices so\ni'm going to control click and drag\nregion onto label and add region to the\nlabels i'm going to undo that and show\nyou what would happen if i just dragged\nregion onto labels without copying it\nwithout holding ctrl it will move it and\nget rid of our colors and we don't want\nthat so we're going to control and drag\nanother way to do this let's go back is\nby taking region and dragging it onto\nlabel just straight from over here but\nin this case for the sum of sales where\nwe've applied the quick table\ncalculation we want that quick table\ncalculation to also show up in our label\nso i'm going to control and drag\nand it brings that quick table\ncalculation along with it if i were to\nundo just drag sales on it's going to go\nback to that dollar amount and i'm going\nto have to add another quick table\ncalculation so instead ctrl and drag\nthat's probably one of my very favorite\ntableau tricks great now let's add a\nfilter for region so i'm going to right\nclick here and click show filter and we\nwill make sure that this gets added to\nall of our sheets once we've made them\nall\nokay next sheet we're going to call this\nsheet\nsales by state\nlet's do a map great so um one way to\nget your map started is to double click\non any of these dimensions that have a\nglobe next to them so since we want to\ngo with state we can double click on\nstate\nand it starts mapping out state so what\nit does is it adds latitude and\nlongitude to our rows and columns that\nare generated here and another way to\nget going so let's go back is to click\non the geographic part you want and then\ncontrol click on sales like we did for\nmap sorry for our pie chart come over to\nshow me and choose one of our maps we\ncould do it with the circles but we're\ngoing to do a field map\nclick on that so now we have our field\nmap based on state\nwe can choose one of these different\npalettes if we'd like let's try this one\nor blue teal\nor we could do green so that darker\ngreen means more money\ngreat so now we have all of our states\ncolored by sales let's also control and\ndrag sales onto label and you can see we\nhave the dollar sign and the money\nformatting that we made earlier and\nlet's control and drag state onto label\nnow maybe we want the state to be on top\nso we can click on label and it pops up\nwith all these different options and if\nwe want to edit the text you can click\nhere\non the ellipses\nand edit it there so let's cut state\nand paste it\nat the top there i think i lost my\ncenter alignment so we'll do that again\nhit apply see what we think\ngreat okay so now you can see that it\nputs the state on top you can also see\nin some of these places where they're\nsuper close together that you can't see\nall of the state's labels and that's\nbecause um this option here in labels is\nunchecked allow labels to overlap other\nmarks so tableau senses when the marks\nare too close together and it's going to\nbecome too hard to read and we'll hide\nanything\nthat overlaps with each other if we\nclick this option now you see everything\nbut it gets a little crowded over here\nso let's unselect that and you'll be\nable to see what the sales are upon\nhover\ngreat now we have our sales by state for\nfilters for this one let's no let's\nright click on sales here and click show\nfilter so basically wherever you're\nusing your metrics your dimensions or\nyour measures you can right click on\nthem\nand create your filters um so now we\ncould uh the lowest amount for a state\nis 920\nfor sales for this time period and we\ncould filter out ones that have sales\nlower than that but\ni think this isn't what i want let's\nremove that filter let's do it for the\nstate show filter great so now we could\nfilter out\na state we could just show\narizona\nor show them all\nexcellent let's move on to our next\nvisualization new sheet\nrename it to be called\nsales by\nsub category\ngreat so we're going to drag on category\nonto columns and subcategories of our\nhierarchy press plus now we have\nsubcategory and category and let's bring\non sales it's defaulting to this bar\nchart which is perfect that's what i\nwant and now we could color it by\nsubcategory and this is a discrete\ncoloring we could also color it by\nsales\nand this is a continuous coloring so the\ndarkest corresponds with the height now\nwe don't need to do this there is\nalready an indicator of who has the most\nsales and that's based on the bar height\nso if we wanted to color it by\nsubcategory then each one of them gets\ntheir own color we could color it by\ncategory to\nadd to\nthe distinction between the different\ncategories so that's very clear\nwhere they start and stop let's do\nby sub category excellent so now we have\nthree different dashboards oh let's add\nsome filters for subcategory so let's\nbring on\ncategory as our filter so we'll right\nclick here click show filter there's\ncategory and let's do a filter for\nour date so we're going to come here to\norder date let's drag it onto filters\nand let's click years\nnow these are all the years options\nwe'll click all\nand hit ok\nright click here and click show filter\nso now instead of doing a range where we\ncould drag that line now we have\ndiscrete filter and so we can\ncheck and uncheck boxes to choose what\nyears we want to see\nawesome let's start with our dashboard\nlet's call this dashboard\nour sales dashboard and\nchange our size\nif you have any questions about\ndifferent sizes what's available here be\nsure to ask that in the comments below\nand let's start with pulling on our\nsales by region so last time we pulled\non a chart we saw that it added the\nlegend for us but this time you can see\nit added both the legends\nand the filter so last time we created\nthe filters after we built the dashboard\nbut this time you can see that the\nfilter um gets brought in when we\nbrought in the dashboard let's do our\nsales by state side by side here and\nlet's do sales by subcategory underneath\nso i dragged it you can see how i pull\nit towards the bottom of the dashboard\nand it kind of fills in the space where\nit's going to be\nand then brings it in so now it's\nbrought in all our filters and all of\nour legends it defaults to putting the\nfilters and legends over here we're\ngoing to click select a layout layout\ncontainer it's going to select what's\nwhat they're all inside of and we're\ngonna make it take up this whole side\nbut it doesn't need that much space\nso you can see in tableau there's a lot\nof dragging there's a lot of dropping\nand\na lot of resizing to get things the way\nyou want them to be give our map more\nroom\nand we have a mixture over here of\nlegends and\nfilters let's move our legends out of\nthere so we can grab this legend and\ncome and put it on this side\nand this legend come and put it over\nhere\nso that we're getting a little bit more\nnear the visualizations they belong to\nthis legend goes up here with this one\ni'm going to actually click here and\nchange it from\na tiled so right here it says tiled\nobject to a floating object that lets it\nsit on top of a visualization i'm going\nto put it on top of this visualization\nright up here\nexcellent and then we have this one\nthat's showing us the size of sales\nthat's because on this dashboard it says\nthat size is determined by sales but\nsince it's just one\ncircle there's no size comparison so\nit's not like we have several circles\nand we have to look and see which one's\nthe biggest so that we can tell that the\namount of sales so we don't need this\nlegend and we can just remove it from\nthe dashboard let's clean up some of\nthese we have several different versions\nof what your filters could look like so\nmy personal favorite is multiple values\ndrop down it gives you some of the most\nflexibility but if you wanted them to\nonly be able to select a single value\nyou could turn it into a radio button\nlist so that it's a selected all or it's\none at a time\nyou could also do a drop down or a\nslider and make that happen\na slider is a little bit different from\na range on the range you can see that we\ncould edit either side and it's picking\neverything in between but with discrete\nvalues if you say everything in between\nit doesn't make a lot of sense because\nwhat's everything between furniture and\ntechnology we don't know that office\nsupplies goes between those there's no\norder so\nlet's do\nmultiple value drop downs\nfor big ones like state there is the\noption\nof searching so i know i want utah and i\nsearch and there's utah\ninstead of having to scroll through the\nlist this could be really helpful for if\nyou had a filter for by products and\nthat would allow somebody to look at\njust one product at a time if they know\ntheir name of the product but also not\nhave to just open up the product list\nand scroll and scroll and scroll since\nthere are very a lot of products so we\ncan filter by region\nby doing this oh this is a great\nreminder you saw that this did not\nchange all the visualizations we have\nyet to apply these filters to all the\nworksheets so let's do that right now\napply to worksheets selected worksheets\nand we will click all on dashboard\nhit okay\nwe'll do this again\nuntil we have selected them all\ngreat so it's really nice you get to\nchoose what worksheets you wanted to\napply to because in the event that you\nhad maybe\na total number up here at the top that\nyou just wanted to stay the same all the\ntime no matter what they selected you\ncould make that happen by not selecting\nthat worksheet to be changed by these\nfilters okay great so we can change what\nregion we're looking at by selecting\ncentral here and then we're just looking\nat central throughout all the\nvisualizations i love looking at it on a\nmap and seeing just one at a time it\njust really makes the region name just\nstand out to you but if we wanted to use\nthis as our filter to filter the rest of\nthe dashboards we can click this uses\nfilter button and now when we click on\ncentral here it stays in context here\nbut the other two dashboards change\none thing you may notice is that texas\nis not the darkest on this chart because\nof the scale the scale goes up to half a\nmillion there but then when we click on\ncentral the scale updates just for\nwhat's selected so everything else is\nfiltered out and now the darkest of the\ndark is only a hundred and seventy\nthousand dollars and texas becomes the\ndarkest on the visualization there are\nsome ways you can change that but if\nyou're wondering why do my colors look a\nlittle differently when i filter that's\nwhy\ngreat we could also click use this\nfilter here so if we just wanted to look\nat texas\nwe click this this updates to just\ncentral this updates to just texas down\nhere and unselect\nby\nclicking on maybe another state or when\nyou click on the state again it should\nunselect and we could do the same thing\nhere or if we just want to look at one\nsub category and say\nlet me scroll down a bit storage now\neverything updates to the storage it's\ninteresting i wouldn't have known very\nquickly that there are some states that\ndidn't have any storage sales but now\nwhen we click on storage we can tell i\nshowed you before that you can control\nclick and look at binders and storage\nand it puts those two together also in\ntableau you can drag\nand we could select all of these so we\nhave art binders envelopes fasteners\nlabels paper and storage and none of\nthose are getting sold here\ni don't know what's up with wyoming\nexcellent so now we have our sales\ndashboard\nand\nlet's get started on our next one our\nnext dashboard is going to be the profit\nversion of this dashboard so some of\nthese visualizations we can use again so\nlet's go to sales by region right click\nand click duplicate\nrename it to\nprofit by region\nnow you have to be careful whenever you\ngo to reuse a visualization because like\ni mentioned before you got to make sure\neverywhere\nthat sales is used you have to replace\nit with profit i'm also going to drag\nthis sheet to be\nmore at the end here after the sales\ndashboard just to keep them separate so\nthat we have the sheets that lead up to\noverall then the sheets that lead up to\nsales and then we'll have the sheets\nthat lead up to profit great so we'll\ngrab profit and drag it onto angle size\nand that updates the angle size drag it\nonto the size of the circle shouldn't\nmake a difference since we only have one\ncircle and onto the text now when i\ndragged it on it didn't do the percent\nof total anymore so let's change that to\nthe quick table calculation of percent\nof total for there and for\nthe label\npercent of total there we go now we have\nour percent total again by region region\nokay here's another thing since we\nduplicated that filter it's going to be\nusing that exact same filter\nyou see it's using region from sales by\nregion all the sales dashboards we don't\nwant that so let's remove out all the\nfilters here\nand these action filters that are\ngenerated by our filtering that those\ncome from\nthis\nthese are called action filters\nand it's generated when we click this\nuses filter button okay back to profit\nby region great we're clear of filters\nand let's add back in a region filter\nand this one no longer has the icon\nthat shows you that it affects multiple\nsheets which is what we want for now\nso you might want perhaps there would be\na situation where you would have two\ndashboards and you would want these\nfilters that you put on here to affect\nboth dashboards and in this case that's\nnot what i want great so\nanother one we can use the basics for is\nsales by subcategory so let's duplicate\nthat\ngreat profit by subcategory already\nexists we made this earlier tableau will\nnot allow you to make a worksheet that\nhas the same name as another worksheet\nyou can\ncall it number one or since it does put\nthe title up here you can put an extra\nspace at the end or it does detect that\nspace it counts it as a different title\neven though it's the same title just\nwith a space that does cause some issues\nso like when we're looking here and\nwe're saying oh profit by subcategory i\nwant that oh this is when we made it but\nyou don't want this one you want this\none and it gets a little confusing the\nnice thing is when you're dragging\nthings onto your dashboard when you\nhover you should get a little picture\nhere of what dashboard what\nvisualization you're looking at it\nreally helps you to\nmake your decisions and not just have to\ndo it by name if you're a little bit\ndisorganized and you have all these\ncalled sheet 5 sheet 7 you won't know\nexactly what that is right away so that\nlittle preview is very helpful great\nprofit by subcategory we'll do the same\nthing by removing out all our filters so\ni just click on it and hit delete\nyou can also control click\nand then hit delete or you can drag them\noff into a space that's not the\nvisualization space great and we only\nhave some of sales right there so we'll\nchange that to profit\nand we have some negative profits there\nwe'll keep the colors the same for\nconsistency between the two dashboards\nand let's bring on\ncategory as a filter okay\nshow filter there we are and let's do\nour order date filter right now order\ndate we'll do years okay\nall the years so it gives you this\noption here because it assumes that\nyou're making a filter because you want\nthis dashboard to just be filtered to\nyour selection you can do that you can\nmake a filter that isn't exposed to the\nend user so let's say you were making a\nbig dashboard and it was just focused on\nfurniture then and you don't want them\nto be able to select a different\ncategory for because of your analysis\nyou can make that happen\nyou can just collect furniture and not\nshow this by clicking hide card here but\nin this case we want to be able to make\nthis interactive\nin a lot of different ways great profit\nby subcategory exists now instead of our\nmap we're going to make an area chart\nso i'll rename this and call it\nprofit\nover time\nby category\nso we're going to\nbring on our order date into columns and\nit goes to our discrete value let's\nchange it to our continuous value so we\nget the axis let's grab our profit onto\nrows and it makes this a line chart\nwe're going to change that to an area\nchart an area chart is nice because when\nyou split it up by category by dragging\ncategory onto color you can now see\nwhat category is responsible for how\nmuch profit like you do with a line\nchart however its area is what defines\nthat so you can see that area over time\nand do comparisons and also it stacks\nthem on top of each other so that you\ncan tell that for 2013 our profit was\naround fifty thousand dollars really\nquickly otherwise we have to add that\nline this line here and it makes these\nlines smaller\nand lower um more difficult to see so\nback to our profit over time by category\nso that's some of the benefits of having\nan area chart and if we wanted to go a\nlittle more detailed than year you can\nhit this plus and now we have over\nquarter we have some negative profits\nthat's interesting but let's go back to\nevery the year great and for this one\nwe're gonna make one more pie chart so\nwe could start from scratch or we could\nduplicate our profit by region pie chart\nwhich i'm going to do\nwe're going to do this for the\ncomparison between a pie chart and an\narea chart so it's going to be profit by\ncategory\nbut not over time so right now it's\nprofit by region let's drag category\nright on top of colors there\nand now it's split up\nit's having some trouble because it's\nsplitting it by category but because of\nwe brought region onto text it's also\nsplitting it by region so we have region\nregion region region inside of this\ncategory and we don't want that so we're\ngoing to drag category right on top of\nregion here as well and now it's just\nthe three segments so whatever you have\nin this marks card unless it's on\ntooltips will affect your level of\ndetail in the visualization here when\nit's on tooltips sometimes it won't\nchange the level of detail but it could\nhave an effect on like so if we brought\noh let's do this right now so right now\nthe level of detail of this chart does\nnot go to the category by\nregion like it did before you can bring\nit onto detail here and it won't affect\ncolor and it won't affect labels but it\nwill change the detail and you see how\nit splits it out again this is what it\nwould look like if it's by region by\ncategory and you have much more slices\nto this pie we'll go back but if we take\nregion and put it onto tooltip it's not\nat a low enough level for that tool tip\nto make any sense so it's going to put\nthat star you see region is star that's\nbecause this section of the pi covers\nmultiple regions if we filtered the\nregion to just central now it populates\nso there are sometimes benefits to\nhaving it in there even when\nat all levels it doesn't make any sense\nbut we won't leave it there\nexcellent so you can see\nhow the color is what determines is a\nbig part of what determines how many\nslices you get the level of detail for\nthe whole chart is a big factor as well\non how many slices you get great profit\nby region profit by category by\nsubcategory and by profit over time and\nwe have\nour category filter we don't have our\nsubcategory filter yet we grabbed\ncategory but let's right click on\nsubcategory and click show filter there\nwe go now we have a filter for category\nand subcategory\nhere's our region one\nwe have region in two places and we\ndon't want that\nwe wanted to apply to all of them we'll\ndo that when we get to the dashboard\nand we have category year of order date\nand subcategory great those are all the\nfilters i wanted so let's build our\ndashboard\nwe'll call this our profit dashboard\nonce i get it set\nto the size i want\nprofit we'll start with profit by\nregion\nand we'll have our profit by category\nover time next to it great we'll give\nthat some different space have this at\nthe bottom\nhave this underneath there\nnow it's bunched all these up\nnext to it so let's again drag it over\nto the side it's always good to pay\nattention to the highlighted section and\nit gives you kind of an idea oh you see\ni accidentally dragged an individual\nfilter instead of this whole section so\nwhen i grabbed this i didn't grab all of\nthese so if you want to grab all of\nthese and they happen to be inside the\nsame section you can come and click\nselect a layout container and now i'm\ngrabbing all of them\nthere we go\nwe'll do the same thing as before you\nknow what i'm going to make these\nfloating\nbecause then it kind of sits inside of\nthat same area i'll make that one\nfloating\nand this one too\nthis category\nlegend applies to both this chart and\nthis chart so that's very nice and this\nsubcategory legend i won't make floating\ni'll just put here by subcategory\nand this profit by category doesn't need\nquite that much space\nlet's give\nour bar chart some room\nexcellent we don't need the size of the\ncircles\nmake these\ndrop downs now\nbecause i didn't have to on\nthis chart and this chart change profit\nto dollars because we set that as the\ndefault it definitely saved us some time\nso\ni recommend setting default number\nformatting\nat the beginning of your visualizations\nreally nice\nexcellent now you can rearrange the\norder of these so i like to have the\ndate at the top it's sometimes hard to\nget it to the top so i take it the\nsecond to the top and i drag the top one\ndown and then um category above\nsubcategory just for logical sense\nexcellent and we have our profit\ndashboard let's see there is this check\nbox down here called show dashboard\ntitle so if we wanted to have the title\nat the top here you can click that\nbutton any floating objects don't shift\ndown\nlike everything else did\nthere we go\nso we could have that title we could not\nhave that title\nthat's up to you excellent so at this\npoint we have our overall dashboard that\nlooks at sales and profit we have our\nsales dashboard and we have our profit\ndashboard our profit dashboard isn't 100\ncomplete because i forgot to make sure\nall of these filters apply to all of\nthese worksheets so let's go ahead and\ndo that right now\napply to worksheets selected worksheets\nall on dashboard\none thing that is nice from this view\nit's really nice to click on dashboard\nand you only see the ones on the\ndashboard but you can click here and say\nshow all worksheets in workbook and you\ncan see the rest here so if you wanted\nall on the dashboard and you wanted this\none or something like that then you have\nthe option to see them all\ngreat perfect so before you ever publish\na dashboard it's always good to double\ncheck that your filters work\nwhen you filter to just one year this\narea chart becomes a lot less useful but\nif you're looking at two or more\nyou start to see the shape of it\ngreat\nnow we're going to take a look at\nlinking from our overall dashboard\nto our sales dashboard\ngreat so we'll go to our overall\ndashboard and we'll be creating what's\ncalled an action\nso you can make an action\non\na worksheet\nyou can see right here\nactions or on a dashboard actions so\nsince we're linking between two\ndashboards this is going to be a\ndashboard action\nsorry just trying to unhighlight there\nbut if you're ever looking for an action\nyou made and you can't find it look in\nthe other one great this is our actions\ndialog box here we can see the highlight\nthat has been generated when it says\ngenerated next to it that means that you\ndidn't come in and define an action it\nwas made by\nclicking\nthis highlight button here that'll\ngenerate an action\nor when we look on our sales dashboard\nwe clicked on this uses filter button so\nwe should have several actions here that\nwere all generated\nwe have a couple different kinds of\nactions\nwhen you go to make an action\nthere's a filter action\nthat we see when we click use this\nfilter a highlight action that we can\nsee from here in region and go to url\naction that we haven't used if you have\nany questions about go to url please\npost them in the comments below\nit basically allows you to be able to\nselect a url here and so\nif you had a dashboard that had to do\nwith maybe stocks you could put in a url\nhere and then put your stock ticker\nsymbol there so that you could have a\nurl that would then take you to a\nfinance website that shows you your\nstock information it can get pretty cool\nokay but we want to\nlink from this dashboard to one of our\nother dashboards and you actually do\nthat using a filter action so we're\ngoing to name that action\ngo\nto\nsales dashboard\nand we wanted to happen when we click on\nour sales sheet so you see right here it\nshows us the two sheets that are on this\ndashboard when we click on the profits\ndashboard we don't want this action to\noccur this is our go to sales dashboard\nnow you can have an action occur on\nhover\nor select you've seen select happen\nthat's what our filter uses filter\nactions use and on menu so we're going\nto do it on menu\nand\nthe targeted sheets it defaults to this\ndashboard saying when i click on this i\nwant the rest of this dashboard to\nupdate but instead it's going to take us\nto our sales dashboard\nso when we click on this i want these\nsheets to update\nnow we're going to define what filters\nit's going to apply by default it's\ngoing to apply all of the filters based\non what we click so if we click here it\nwill filter to just 2013 let's say we\nclick here it'll filter to just 2013 and\nit will filter to the region we selected\nso\nlet's see what happens when we do that\nokay it's just going to default okay now\nwhen i click on this it's going to\nfilter to 2013 and west go to sales\ndashboard this is where it pops up when\nyou have it on menu\nit's taken us to our sales dashboard it\nis filtered 2013 and west\njust so you know actions will not affect\nthese filters here you see that it\nthinks all of them are selected because\nit creates a separate filter there is\nsuch thing as show only relevant values\nfor these filters so if we click this it\nwill filter this to only the ones that\nare relevant so we can see that it's\nonly 2013 that this dashboard is\nfiltered down to but if we click all\nvalues in the database this filter\ndoesn't have any only one particularly\nselected it does have them all selected\nright now\nso we can get here\nfor that information and to get back\nwe just need to navigate back to overall\ngreat so it works there\nbut when we click on this up here\ngo to sales dashboard\nwe get a blank dashboard now\nthat happens because\nit's trying to pass region information\nto that dashboard\nbut this doesn't have any region detail\non this line it doesn't know what that\nis so it's giving it a bad region value\nso let's fix this\ngo to our actions we're going to edit\nour go to sales dashboard and we're\ngoing to select what fields\nit'll filter on\nwe will filter on\nour order date\nyear\nand\nlet me go back to that\nwe click to order date year and it goes\nto the target data source sometimes your\ntarget data source will be a different\ndata source than the one that you are\nusing for your source data source now\nthat gets a little bit complicated right\nnow we're just using one data source so\nthat's not something you need to worry\nabout in a simple visualization like\nthis\nokay and we're gonna add one more\nwe're gonna add region\nand it automatically selects region over\nhere but you could select it yourself\nlet's see what happens here okay\nif um one dashboard has region in it and\nthe other dashboard doesn't have region\nin it or doesn't allow you to filter by\nregion then sometimes you'll get an\nerror here that will say it's missing\nout of your target dashboards\nso we don't have any errors so let's see\nwhat happens\nso we go to click here\ngo to sales dashboard\nwhat if\nwe\ntake out region\nremove region and we're just doing it\nbased on year\nokay okay click here go to sales\ndashboard and there everything is\nso now\nit will filter back to the year that you\nselected so this is all 2013 but it will\nnot filter to the region you selected\nso even when we come here and we select\nwest\nit takes you to the dashboard but it\ndoesn't filter it to west\nyou have to do that yourself\nso now we have links\nfrom sales to\nsales\nlet's make one for profit to profit\ngo to sales dashboard add action\nfilter\nwe're going to call this go to profit\ndashboard\nand we're only going to come from the\nprofit table to make this happen\nlet's go to profit and let's select our\nfields\nwe're going to do the same thing\nwhere it's only going to filter it to\nthe year now you can see oh i started to\ntype in i didn't show you this before\nbut you can search text so i started\ntyping in year and it shows you that\nunder order date you have all these\ndifferent options in this dashboard\nright now if you remember we're using\nthe continuous one that is marked by\nthe little calendar\nso that's it knows it's a calendar date\ninstead of just\ntrading it like a discrete field\nokay\nexcellent go to profit dashboard and\nthere we go this visualization like we\nsaid when it's filtered to just one year\nisn't quite as useful but one thing you\ncan do\nis for west here we can select\nboth years i'm i'm going to do it by\ncontrol clicking click\nclick\ngo to profit dashboard\nand now we've got 2015 and 2016. so\nthat's how you do linking between the\ntwo dashboards if you wanted to be able\nto include region as well\nyou could\nput a note in the tooltip for this that\nthis doesn't work for\nregion linking from this area doesn't\nwork or perhaps you could not have this\ntotal line on the same visualization you\ncould have a separate visualization that\nshows the total or an area chart instead\nand that will let you not have this\nproblem of go to sales dashboard not\nlinking appropriately\nso now we're going to create our final\ndashboard our segment dashboard and it's\ngoing to use a parameter in it so we'll\nget to take a look at parameters on\ndashboards\nso let's rename this we're going to call\nit\nprofit\nand sales\nby\nsegment you don't have to name all of\nyour dashboards a description of what\nthey are but it makes it really nice and\neasy and it automatically puts it up\nhere but if you wanted to change this\nyou can just come in here and name this\nwhatever you like\nand then it will just show up up here so\nwe could call this segment analysis\nclick apply or ok and there it goes\nthat means this and this does not have\nto be the same\nif we go forward again segment analysis\nand profit and sales by segment that\nallows you to have some\nmore useful names down here that make it\neasy when you're looking at them side by\nside but have a name to match your\ndashboard up here great so we're going\nto\nmake\na profit in sales it's going to be a\nbars and circles chart and we're going\nto bring in our segment that we haven't\nlooked at yet consumer corporate and\nhome office and then we're going to look\nat it segment and we're going to make a\nmatrix with category and we get to fill\nin this space with our\nvisualizations so we're going to do\nsales\nand it's going to make these bar charts\nso we can see for technology by consumer\nby corporate by home office and that is\na matrix of bar charts but we also want\nto be able to see profit\nand right now it's making two sets of\nvisualizations\nbut we want just one so let's dual axis\nand it's automatically changed it to\ncircles also it is not\nsynchronizing the axis now because\nprofit is blue and these profit is not\nanywhere near the same amount as sales\nwhich makes sense you shouldn't have\nprofit that's higher than sales so let's\nsynchronize our axis\nand let's change our sales our marks\ncard over here is associated with sales\nit's nice and easy when the two marks\ncards are based on a different measure\nto let you know which one you're\naffecting and we'll change that to a bar\nand now we have a circle on\na bar chart now if we had profit in\nfront of sales\nyou can see how it's behind and you can\nfix that by taking it to the back of\nsales another way you can fix it\nsay you wanted the profit access here\nover here for some reason you can right\nclick on the axis and put mark type or\noh move marks to front\nanother way to change it we don't need\nboth of these so let's not show that\nheader and we don't need this to be\nlabeled profit because it's for both of\nthem so the way you get rid of that is\nactually you click edit axis\nand then you just erase the title\noh and you don't hit reset you just\nerase the title\nand then you close it\nso now no title here but we still have\nthe axes\nand we have three sets of bar charts\nacross excellent the next chart we're\ngoing to build oh so right now they are\nit automatically added the colors based\non measure names measure names is a\ndimension that is created by tableau and\nit's just what it sounds like we're\ncoloring it based on the different\nmeasure names one of them is named\nprofit one of them's named sales and we\nknow that you can come here click color\nand hit edit colors and it will open\nthis dialog box but you can also come\nhere and double click on a color pops\nopen that dialog box let's\npick\na palette\nlet's see\nthere's a lot of different ones of these\ntableau 20\nlet's pick colors from this palette\nprofit can be\nso you click here make sure it's\nhighlighted click the color you want\nclick here make sure it's highlighted\nclick the color you want\nhit apply\nand then you can come to color and make\nit a little more opaque\nwhatever when you make it more opaque\nyou start to be able to see through your\ncircles\nthere are benefits but also drawbacks to\ndoing that\nanyway\nso stick with the tableau orange blue\ngreat we have our first chart our next\nchart is going to be called\ntop\ncustomers\nby sales and this is where we're going\nto use our parameter where we made our\ntop end customers so\nlet's bring in\nour sum of sales make a bar chart for\nthat and then we're also going to we're\nbringing in our set now so we have our\nin and our out we're going to break up\nour set\nby our segment as it's part of our\nsegment analysis and we'll bring in our\ncustomer names\nand let's sort it excellent now you can\nsee that when we sorted it it didn't\ntake this big guy and put it all the way\nat the top it just sorted it each within\nits own section great and so here we\nhave our in and out and that's not a\nsuper user-friendly title for\nour users of this dashboard they're like\nin and out of top end customers by sales\nmaybe we want this to say something a\nlittle bit more user-friendly so let's\nmake a calculated field and we're going\nto call it the top and customers\nlabel\nand we're going to go and say if\nand we're going to use our set top end\ncustomers by sales and since it's an in\ntheir outset it treats this like\nif it's in top end customers by sales\nthen\ntop\nwe're going to\ndo a streak so it's going to be top and\nthen we want to use the number that's in\nour parameter so we have to convert it\nfrom a number to a string and we have to\nconcatenate them together in tableau you\ncan use a plus sign top and always make\nsure you have a space between what\nyou're concatenating together that's\nsomething that i tend to forget\ntop space customers so if they pick 20\nit'll say top 20 customers\nso if it's in this set then top blank\ncustomers\nelse if it's not in the set we will just\ncall it other and in tableau you always\nneed to end your if statement with an\nend here it tells us our calculation is\nvalid while we're here i want to show\nyou a little trick there's this arrow\nbutton here\nthat can give you all of the different\nfunctions that are available within\ntableau\nand it even sorts it out by different\ncategories so if we didn't know how to\nmake this into a string we could go to\ntype conversion we could click on string\nand it gives you an example also when\nyou click on\na function in here did you see how it's\non date and then i clicked on string and\ni'm like what does this do click on it\nand it tells me so this makes it really\nuseful inside of tableau also in tableau\nyou can make a comment in here so if\nsomebody's like what's going on here you\ncan press dash\nor\nslash slash and type in\nthis is a more user-friendly\ntitle hit okay and there we go we have\nour more user-friendly title we drag it\nhere we see our top 20 customers and\nother and we don't want to show this\nanymore but we still want it in place\nyou can click right click on it up here\nand click show header and it hides it so\nthat in out is still happening there and\nlet's drag it to our filters and there\nwe have it we have our top link\ncustomers and it tells you right there\nhow many and we need to come here to\nparameter right click and click show\nparameter control and that's how we can\ncontrol\nthese changes so let's set it to 10 at\nfirst and we have it our top customers\nby sales but it's interesting to know\nprofit as well so we have really big\nsales but how is their profit doing so\nlet's draw profit on color and you can\nsee this person has a negative amount of\nprofit despite their big sales so that's\nimportant for us to know and we can\nchange our color like we did previously\nto go from red to blue\nand we can\nchange our center to zero\nand now we can see the negatives really\nquickly\nnow they're not the only one neither i\nhave a negative profit but some of our\nhighest sales that's great to know\nexcellent those are our visualizations\nfor the segment dashboard so let's talk\nabout filters really quick we have this\nfilter we won't show the filter itself\nwe don't want to allow them to\nshow in or out we just are going to\nallow them to show how many\nbut we do want to be able to have them\nfilter by category so let's show that\nfilter and by segment\nshow that filter and and then we'll have\nour parameter great let's make our\ndashboard\num automatic as you probably read right\nthere the dashboard will resize to fit\nany screen it is displayed on that can\nbe really handy especially if your\nvisualization is really dynamic and can\nchange however some visualizations like\nthis visualization for example if it\ngets too squished you stop being able to\nread things very well so automatic has\nits definite pros and cons\nso we're gonna bring on our profit and\nsales by segment and it already pops up\nwith its\nlegend and total customers\nby sale and it pops up with its legends\nand filters and it pops up with its\nparameter now i'm going to close that\nand be like if you don't see your\nparameter when you first bring it in the\nparameter is affecting this sheet and\nyou can go to parameters and find it but\nparameters are\nworkbook wide meaning that it's going to\nexist over here too\nit doesn't affect this sheet however\nit's still going to show up there\nbecause it could affect it is available\nfor any sheet and it's the same there is\nno determining what worksheets this\naffects this will affect any sheet that\nit is on so if i i've changed it to 10\nand if i come down here and go back to\nthe other visualization that uses it\nthis is why i should name my sheets\nlet's see if i can find it\nnope\nhere we are sheet 13. in sheet 13\nwe have our top 10. so i've got a 10 and\ni've got a 10 over there and if i change\nit to 20\nand i go back to my segment dashboard\nit is also changed to 20. so it will\naffect all sheets always very important\nto know great so here's our\nvisualization\nhere are some of the more useful legends\nso\nlet's\nmake this floating and put it over by\nthe visualization it matters for we can\ndo the same thing here floating right up\nhere floating does not work very well\nfor if you were to make this an\nautomatic dashboard so that the size\nchanges all the time because floating\ncould end up right on top of your\nvisualization and keep you from being\nable to see what you need to see\nand let's make these affect\nall the dashboards in the workbook\nagain we don't have to do this for our\nparameter\nit will already affect all the\ndashboards in the whole\nworkbook\nand format these\nanother thing you should know is that\nthere are more formatting options for\nthese\num including edit title so it's already\nnamed it category automatically but if\nyou had\nlike here oh this is a great example\nedit title top end customers and you\ncould change it to\nselect\nnumber of top customers\nor something like that give it a little\nmore space\nand yeah these floating ones do not\nshift when you shift things so it's\nalways good to double check your\nfloating legends\nand this is a little bit more user\nfriendly\nthan the title we made for the\ndevelopers\nthat's using parameters in a dashboard\ntoday in this video we learned about an\noverview of business intelligence on\ntableau we talked about how to install\ntableau public and how to connect to a\ndata source\nwe also talked about creating calculated\nfields\nlike this one\nwe talked about making sets and\nparameters we learned how to make a\ndonut chart\nand a 2d donut chart we learned about\nmaking dashboards\nand adding filters to those dashboards\nand we also learned about connecting\nbetween dashboards welcome to tapo\ntraining part 2. we will be learning\nabout the topics we discussed in part\none live versus extract data sources\nwe'll talk about joins and unions and\nwe'll look at table calculations we'll\nlook at the rank functions and we'll\nlook at actions specifically url actions\nwe'll talk about reference lines and\nbands we'll look into some insights in\nthe data such as delay analysis also\nwe'll learn how to build a waterfall\nchart and then finally we will learn\nabout level of detail calculations while\nmaking two different visualizations\nin part one of this tableau training we\nintroduced tableau basics and we learned\nhow to create\ndonut charts and two-dimensional donut\ncharts and we learned about linking\nbetween dashboards now let's discuss the\ndifference between a live connection and\nan extract connection first it's\nimportant to note that these different\ntypes of connections are not available\nin tableau public it's always a live\nconnection and a live connection is\nwhere the data will update\nbased on when the source of the data\nupdates so if any if you're connected to\na database and something in the database\nchanges then you'll pick up those\nchanges when you open the report as it\nwill query that database\nwhen the report is opened whereas an\nextract connection\nis extracted into creates a subset of\nthe data that improves performance so\nwhen you're looking at it locally on\nyour computer you have an extract of\nthat data set that subset of the data\nright on your computer or up in tableau\nserver depending on where you're looking\nat it and it does not update\nwhen the database updates it only\nupdates when your refresh updates it so\nwithout a refresh set for that extract\nyou won't get the new data as an example\nof this let's say\nthat in our\nsample superstore we have kelly williams\nassociated with the central region but\nthat's changed so let's go ahead and\nchange that\nwe will change it to\nsarah smith\nand\nwe'll save it\nnow let's go back to our tableau\nworkbooks\nand you can see we can refresh it over\nhere and see sarah smith come in\nover here in our extract\nit sarah smith doesn't come in\nif we click to refresh the extract it\ndoesn't refresh the extract until we\nnavigate to sheet 1\nbut when we go back to our data source\nthen we see sarah smith coming in so\nthat refresh can be scheduled and it\ncould run once a day\nor once every several hours\nbut you would need to set up a refresh\nor else you would never get sarah\nsmith's data coming in\nnext let's talk about joining data in\ntableau so here we have the people table\nbut let's say we want to join it to our\norders information so i'm going to start\nwith our orders table\nand then we're going to pull on people\nand tableau is going to\ncreate a join for us and it's going to\nchoose the column that we would like to\njoin on based on the names in the two\ndata sources so if these two data\nsources didn't have a column that had\nthe same name then tableau wouldn't be\nable to guess\nwhat\ntwo to join on\nso we would have to come in and select\nout of the order side\nand the people side\nwhat we'd like to join on and then we\nhave the options to do an inner join a\nleft join a right join and a full outer\njoin let's review quickly what these\nlook like so say we had two tables that\nwe wanted to join together one of them\nwas the student table that had the\nstudent names and the key to their grade\nand which we could use to look up their\ngrade over here in the grade table which\nhad the key to their grade and the\nactual grade a b c d f and incomplete\nwe can see here that somebody has made a\nmistake and put in a letter grade\ninstead of the key to the letter grade\nand we'll see how that affects what\nwe're looking at\nso if we were to do an inner join\nthat would only take\nthe rows where the join could complete\nso\nwe have one that could join to one just\nfine but we don't have two and we don't\nhave three a doesn't join to anything so\nthis row would be\nnot included and then four\nfive and six would all join so that\nwould look something like this where we\nwould see adam\nwhen we grab student from this table and\ngrade from this table we can see adam\nhad an a beverly had an a dale had a d\nelizabeth had an f and frank is\nincomplete and charles is missing also\nyou don't see\nany b or c in this list of grades\nfor a left join it's going to take\neverything\nfrom the left table\nand only the pieces from the right table\nthat apply to the left table so it looks\npretty similar to our inner join\nonly charles shows up so the join wasn't\nable to complete since a doesn't exist\nin grade but we include charles anyways\nand grade\nbecomes null\nfor charles it won't put in the grade\nkey because it's we're not asking for\nthe grade key we're asking for grade\nfrom the grade table so we try to look\nup a inside of the grade table we can't\nfind it and never tolerance no we look\nup a inside the grade key perfect right\njoin is like a left join only it takes\neverything from the right table instead\nof the left table\nso it grabs all the grades a b c d f and\nincomplete and only the rows from the\nleft table that\njoin appropriately so since charles\ndoesn't join appropriately he doesn't\nshow up we also\nhave b and c showing up\neven though it doesn't exist in the\nstudent table\nand it won't be tied to a student\nbecause that join wasn't able to\ncomplete as it didn't exist over there\nand the last one is a full outer join\nwhere it takes everything from both\ntables\nwhether or not the join is complete so\nwe have all of the people where the join\ncompletes we also have charles where the\njoin doesn't complete from the left to\nthe right and we have b and c where the\njoin doesn't complete from the right to\nthe left\nso those are our options in tableau\nhere\nin our sample superstore data set\nyou could look and see if there are any\nregions in the orders table that don't\nexist in the people table and that's how\nyou can know what kind of join you want\nand so if you want those orders to still\nshow up even though they don't have a\nregion\nor their region is\nnot in\nthe people table that's when you would\ndo a left join\nfor our purposes\nwe'll do an inner join\nnow let's say\nwe had a second\nexcel sheet\nhere\nthat had more\norders and you can do a union which is\njust adding more orders\nby dragging that second orders table\nright underneath the original orders\ntable you can see it says their drag\ntable to union and that's helpful for if\nyou have an excel sheet\nfor maybe different years so say you had\na separate excel sheet for the orders in\n2015 and then another one for the orders\nin 2016 you could pull on your 2015\norders and then drag your 2016 orders\nright there to union\nand it would take these orders and then\nadd the rows instead of the columns\nfor the 2016 orders\nfor example we've added people\nbut as a join and that will\nfirst put in all of our orders\nas columns and then add the columns for\nour person\nbut if we were adding more data that\nfell under the order\ncolumns so it would have the same data\nthe same order id ship date but we\nwanted to add more rows then that would\nbe one new union\nnow we're going to take a look at\ncalculations and which ones are\ncalculated on the database side versus\nwhich are calculated on the table side\nso here we have percentage of total\nsales split up by subcategory and\ncategory\nwe also have\npercentage of total sales a long table\ndown so the difference between these two\nthings are one of them is made using\na calculated field\nwhich is where we do the sum of sales\ndivided by the sum of fixed sum of sales\nthis part is called a level of detail\ncalculation\nand this calculation the sum of sales\nand the sum of the level of detail of\nsales\nwhich basically makes\nthe database find the total\nsum of sales regardless of\nthese dimensions we pulled on\nso it gives us our total number so this\nwill be sum of sales for bookcases and\nthis will be sum of sales for everything\nthis calculation is done on the database\nside whereas this one percentage of\ntotal sales along table down is what's\ncalled a table calculation\nit's a quick table calculation of\npercent of total and it is done\nin tableau\nit's processed locally right inside of\nthe table after the aggregations have\noccurred\nthere are some pros and cons of doing it\nthis way\nso for\nthis percent of total sales\ni had to create the table calculation\nhere\nand it is the fixed\nsum of sales where it finds the sum of\nsales for the entire database and since\nit is fixed it will ignore filters so\nfor example\ni took off both of the sales and i'm\njust going to put on the percent sum of\nsales and let's say we wanted to see how\noffice supplies and technology are as\npercentages of sum of sales\nand ignore furniture so we can grab\ncategory and we'll control\nclick and drag\nand we're going to unselect furniture\nand hit ok\nnow it's still\ntaking it out of the total sum of sales\nincluding furniture and so our grand\ntotal down here is only 67 instead of\n100\nwhereas\nif we take\nsales\nand double click it and adds it over\nhere on the table then we right click\nand do a quick table calculation\nand click\npercent of total\nthis one is doing it out of 100 and\nthese numbers don't match\nand that's because it does take into\naccount the filter of category so let's\npull the filter of category off and we\ncan see that they're both out of 100 now\nand each of these take into account\num\nthe same amount of data since we have no\nfilters here\nso if you wanted to take into account\nthe filters on the table\nthen you need to use a table calculation\nhowever when you push the information\nback to the database to do the\ncalculation it's doing it as part of the\nquery to the data source and it can save\nyou some time and so which one of these\nis faster sort of depends on what data\nis available already when the original\nquery comes back\nnext we're going to discuss ranking in\ntableau\nfirst let's add a second data source so\nwe can do that by coming up to data and\nclicking new data source or you can just\nclick this plus data source right here\nand click microsoft excel\nwe're going to use this rank example\nworksheet\nperfect and it's already pulled in the\nsheet we want because there's only one\nsheet and we'll go to sheet 2\npull on store\npull on sales\nand we will rename sheet 2\nas\nrank example\nso now we have here's all of our stores\nand here are our sales and if we wanted\nto rank them\nbased on who had the highest sales to\nthe lowest sales we could create a\ncalculated field\ncalled rank by sales\nand we're going to use our rank\nfunction\nand we're going to put in sales now we\nreceive this error here so when we hover\nwe see what that arrow says oh you can\nclick and it says all fields must be\naggregate or constant when using table\ncalculation functions or fields from\nmultiple data sources so we learn\nsomething unique here\nthat you might not know is that a rank\nis a table calculation\nand it requires it to be aggregated\nso\nwe can make sum\nand put the parentheses around sales\nand our error goes away so now we know\nrank is a table calculation\nand we have our box here that expands\nout and can teach us about what we're\nusing here so when i click on rank it\nwill tell us that it returns the\nstandard competition rank for the\ncurrent row and it says identical values\nare assigned an identical rank so let's\nsee what that looks like we'll hit okay\nwe'll double click on rank by sales now\nwe can see our ranks so e had the\nhighest sales so it's 1\nd is next and c and b are tied\n20 and 20\nand so they both share the rank of three\nand then because they are two of them\nthat share the same rank we skip four\nand the next one gets fifth place\nbut now this isn't the only way to rank\nso let's make another one of these\nwe'll click duplicate\nand edit\nlet's erase copy\nwe're going to call this rank dense\nby sales double click on rank start\ntyping rank again and we're going to\nclick rank dense\nnow the difference here is that rank\ndense returns the rank\nwhere identical values are assigned an\nidentical rank but no gaps are inserted\nin the numbers\nso click ok double click rank dense and\nyou can see instead of going one two\nthree five\nit goes one two three four\nso it doesn't include that gap now let's\ngive them a little bit more space here\nand maybe i wanted to be in the order i\ncreated it so these measure values are\ndefining what's going to happen up here\nso we can take sales and put it at the\ntop\nand that will move sales to the front\nand put rank dents at the bottom so now\nwe can see sales we could see rank by\nsales we rank dents by sales\nnow let's duplicate\nand\nlook at the next one\nwe have rank\nmodified\nnext\nand\nchange the name here you notice that i\nreceive an error\nand that's because that name already\nexists tableau won't allow you to use\nthe same name\nand it will give you that error so those\nerrors can be pretty helpful in finding\nout what's going on hit apply\nand okay and then double click rank\nmodified by sales\nand now we can see\nthe difference here\nlet's go back here and\nlook at what it says here click on rank\nmodified and it says it returns the\nmodified competition rank where\nidentical values are assigned an\nidentical rank\nbut\nwhat happens instead\nis instead of both receiving three\nfor third place\nthey both receive four\nwhich is the lower of the options so if\nwe were going\nby rank and we just arbitrarily decided\nthat this one's third place and this\none's fourth place\nthen they both receive the same rank\nhere but they receive the higher of the\ntwo options whereas this one receives\nthe lower of the two options and let's\ndo one more\nduplicate\nedit\nerase copy\nand we're going to do\nrank\nunique\nand let's change the name\nto rank unique\nperfect and now this is going to give it\na unique\nranking even when they share the same\nnumber so we'll hit apply\nokay double click rank unique\nand we have one two\nthree four and five\nso what it's doing is\nlet's quickly\nlook here so\nrank by sales\nwe haven't talked about this yet but you\ncan choose to rank it ascending or\ndescending that means that do we want to\nrank it based on\nwhether you see here it says ascending\nor descending and that's how you will\ndefine so it defaults to descending and\nit's saying the biggest is the best\nso\nin for sales that's accurate so what\nit's doing is biggest down now here it\nhas to decide which one to give three\nand which one to do for\nand it's doing that based on the ascii\nvalues\nof the store\nso it's looking at more information on\nthe row and since uppercase b comes\nbefore lowercase c uppercase b is\ngetting the three\neven though they both have 20 for sales\nlet's go back now to our orders data\nand we'll make a new sheet\nand now we're going to talk about\nactions in tableau we've talked about\nactions briefly before\nin our tableau training video for\nbeginner so if you want to see the\nintroduction you can go and look there\nalso if you want to follow along with\nour data sets you can comment below and\nask and the simply learn team will get\nyou that data set\nso let's make a chart where we're going\nto look at\ncategory so we'll drag category onto\ncolumns and then we're going to look at\nsales so we'll drag sales onto rows and\nit will create three bar charts for us\nand we're going to\ncall this\nsales by category\nnow let's make a second chart that we\nwill use together and we'll bring\ncategory onto columns and we'll bring\nsubcategory onto columns\nand let's bring sales\nonto rows again\nand let's\ntake\nsubcategory and bring it onto color and\nthat makes each subcategory its own\ncolor and we'll call this sheet\nsales by subcategory\nso now back to sales by category here\nyou can make a worksheet action\nwhere we're going to\nmove from the sales by category sheet to\nthe sales by subcategory sheet and also\nfilter down that sheet to only the\ncategory we want to see\nso click filter\nand we can name this filter\ngo to sub category\nand we're going to do this filter on\nselect so this name won't be seen except\nfor in our actions list\nand what sheets do we want to affect\nwe're going to have\nsales by category show up one thing to\nnote here it is only showing the sheets\nfor it to affect based on the ones that\nare using this data source at this point\nso you can see we have four sheets down\nhere but it's only showing three sheets\nand that's because rank example if you\nrecall is using the rank example data\nsource so you can click here and you can\nsee all the sheets or you can see the\nother\ndata source if we click rank example it\nwill show the rank example data source\nso we just want sales by category to be\nthe source sheet\nand the target sheet we want it to be\nsales by subcategory\nso on select we want it to be sales by\nsubcategory we're going to use all the\nfields available\nto create this filter and hit ok so now\nwe have our go to subcategory on select\nwe'll hit ok again\nand let's\nmake this a little wider so we can see\nand so when we click on furniture it\nwill take us to only furniture of\nthe sales by subcategory we go back to\ncategory we click on office supplies now\nwe just see office supplies\nand this is\na way to make tableau drill to a lower\nlevel\ngreat so we have those\nnow let's\nduplicate this sales by category sheet\nand let's see if we go to worksheet and\nwe go to\nactions\nyou can see that we have the action here\ngo to subcategory that still exists on\nour duplicated sheet as well so you can\nsee it's affecting both sheets\nsales by category and sales by category\n2. let's say we don't want that and we\ncan\nunselect sales by category 2.\nand hit ok\nand hit ok\nnow when we go to worksheet actions\nyou can tell that it's not affecting\nthat sheet so if we come and click\ntechnology nothing should happen but we\ngo to sales by category and click\ntechnology it'll take you to the\ntechnology subcategory\ngreat so we have our sales by category\ntwo let's bring it to the end\nrename it\nwe're going to call it sales by category\nstacked\nbecause we're going to take subcategory\nhere and drag it onto color\nand now we can see our different\nsubcategories\nin the colors there\nnow we can take a look\nhere\nand sort by subcategory based on some of\nsales\nand now you can see that\nit is the biggest sales at the bottom\nfor each subcategory that's just\na way that i like to view it so\nlet's do a highlight action and we're\ngoing to do it on a dashboard\nso let's take\nsales by\nsubcategory\nand look at it over top of our sales by\ncategory stacked over top of sales by\nsap category so we want both of those\nlet's make our\ndashboard automatic for\ntesting purposes\nand we'll go to dashboard we'll click\ncreate actions so we're going to add an\naction it's going to be a highlight\naction\nhighlight sales by\nsubcategory\nand we are going to have the\nsales by category stacked be the source\nsheet and the sales by subcategory be\nthe target sheet for all fields okay\nokay and on select you can highlight\nyour chart\nthere and see where it falls inside of\nthe other visualization\na cool thing you can do is you could\nselect office supplies here and it will\nhighlight all of office supplies\nor if you drag\nand select a couple of them it will show\nyou those so you're just like i want to\nsee all these small ones or i want to\nsee\nthis one and these small ones or\nwhatever then it will highlight the ones\nthat you drag and select now this is\nalso true of our sales by subcategory\nand sales by category so when we clicked\non technology it filtered to just\ntechnology\nand we'll undo that and when we drag and\nclick\noffice supplies and technology we get\noffice supplies and technology now if we\ngo back to the dashboard we can see that\nthis dashboard is now filtered also to\noffice supplies and technology and\nthat's because we're using the same\nsheet\nand when you navigate away from that\nsheet it doesn't mean that your filter\ngoes away\nso when i click undo\nthat's when it caused the filter to go\naway so\nif you're going to have two\nthings affect that sheet\njust remember that just because you\nnavigated away from what you selected\ndoesn't mean that what you selected goes\naway that filter will stay there it\nshows up right here\nand if we pull it off everything goes\nback to normal however the action is\nstill there so when you click on it it\ncomes back\nnow let's take a look at the last kind\nof action which is a url action\nso we're going to make a map based on\nstate so i'm going to double click state\nand it's going to build out my map let's\nchange it to a filled\nmap\nby clicking map up here\nand we're going to take sales and put it\nonto color\nso now it's colored based on the darkest\nis the highest sales\nwe're going to put state onto label so\nyou can see the state name and we're\ngoing to put sales onto label\nso we can see the sales amount let's\nquickly\nchange our default property for sales\nso that it always shows up as currency\nand we're gonna\nlose the decimal places\nso it'll by default show up with a\ndollar sign and\nso on\ngreat so now we have our sales map and\nwe're going to create\na worksheet action now the difference\nbetween a worksheet action and a\ndashboard action is that a worksheet\nwill only affect the worksheet and\ndashboard will only affect the dashboard\nand so when we created our worksheet\naction on sales by category if we were\nto pull sales by category onto the\ndashboard that action won't transfer\nover you'll need to make a dashboard\naction\nso we're going to make a go to url\naction we're going to have it on menu\nwe're going to call it wiki and it's\ngoing to only affect\nour new sheet\nsheet 6 which we should rename and we're\ngoing to have a url in here so this will\ntake us to wikipedia and then whatever\nyou put at the end of the wikipedia link\nit will take you to that page on\nwikipedia so\nwe're going to take state and add it to\nthe end of that link\nand now to test the link you can just\nclick test link\nand it will take a random value and show\nyou what it will look like\nso now that's how we know that we have\nour link set up\nokay click ok let's rename our sheet to\nurl\nfilter by state\nand so when we click on texas\nokay back to url filter by state let's\ngo to our worksheets\nand go to our actions and on the go to\nsub category\nit is also affecting this url filter by\nstate because we didn't unselect it now\nto keep that from being a problem we're\ngoing to just come here and sales by\ncategory be the only sheet and that way\nit won't auto select no sheets as you\ncreate them\nso we'll no longer have that problem you\nclick on texas and nothing happens\nexcept for it highlights that one only\nthat's how it should be but when we\nhover around texas and wait long enough\noh yeah on click sometimes you just have\nto hold still it'll come up with our\nlittle link here and we click on wiki\nand it will open up\nour browser with the wikipedia page for\ntexas this can become really handy in\nthe event that you have data that maybe\nhas an order id and you can take that\norder id and insert it into a url in\nyour system so that it can take you to\nyour web interface page for that order\nhere it's helpful for if we wanted to\nlearn more about the state of california\nwhich\nit can have information about the\nlanguages spoken\nand population\nwhich can be helpful when we're looking\ninto our sales information\nanother way this can be useful is by\nshowing the web page right inside of\ntableau so let's make a dashboard\nchange our size to automatic and let's\npull in url filter by state\nif we go to dashboard actions you can\nsee there are no actions for this\ndashboard yet so we're going to add a go\nto url action on select\nand since it's on select the name of\nthis url won't\nshow up\nbut it will show up in our list here so\nit's nice to me with something unique\nlet's put in our wikipedia page and\nit'll take us to state so we'll hit okay\nokay and now when we click on oklahoma\nit'll open up a page for oklahoma\nbut let's unselect oklahoma if we drag\non web page from the objects here\nyou don't even have to enter anything\nfor your url you just hit ok and now we\nhave the bottom half of the screen is a\nweb page and when we click on oklahoma\ninstead of taking us to oklahoma in a\nseparate thing it'll take us to oklahoma\nright here\nin the visualization so we'll change it\nto texas and this will change to texas\nif you unselect it leaves the page there\nbased on the one that you had just\nselected\nnext we're going to take a look at\nreference bands and lines so let's make\na new sheet\nand we're going to call it\nreference\nlines\nand so a reference line is found on the\nanalytics pane\nand it is something that comes and draws\na line on your visualization based on\nthe data on the screen so\nlet's make\nour visualization we'll do our category\nand sub category again\nand we'll double click on\nsales and it brings it onto text that's\nnot what i want so let's do sales onto\nrows and we have our bar charts\nand\nwe'll talk about the difference between\na cell a pane and the table so when we\ngo to analytics\nand we code to drag our reference line\nonto\nour visualization it says you can add\nthe reference line for the whole table\nfor a pane or for a cell\nso\nif we\ntake our subcategory and drag it onto\ncolor\nsince the subcategory is our lowest\nlevel it's going to define our cell\nso each one of these if we drag our\nreference line onto\nso\neach one of them gets a reference line\nyou see how it added those on this is\nour dialog box we will look at that in\njust a moment\nso let's remove that if we take\nreference line and put it onto pane\nthat's going to be similar to have a\ncategory on a color so each of these\ndifferent colors\nis now a pane\nreference line onto pane and you see how\nwe get reference lines\nbased on each pane\nso let's undo that\nand now if we take category off and\neverything is all one color and we take\nreference line and put it on to table\nnow we have our reference line for the\nwhole table\ngreat so we're going to do\nfind out the average for each section\nso i'm going to take category and put it\nback onto color and we'll take reference\nline and put it onto pane\nnow we have our reference line it's\nbased on the computation of average\nand it's using the value of sum of sales\nso since it says sum of sales here you\nmight think that it was taking the cut\nreference line and putting it at the sum\nof the sales but that's not what's\nhappening it's just using our aggregated\nversion of sales to figure out the\naverage\nso instead of taking each individual\nsale\nthat makes up the bookcase section it's\ntaking the sum of sales for the bookcase\nsection and comparing it to the sum of\nsales for chairs\nso taking an average across these added\nup sections\nwe could also have it be\ntotal\nwhere it's adding all of these up and it\nmakes that total line\nthe sum line is the same as total in\nthis case a constant which is where you\nget to define the value and so if we\nwanted it to be 200\n000 there it is\nlet's go back\nthere we are back to where we were\nconstant minimum which shows you the\nminimum for each section\nthe maximum for each section\nor the average\nor the median\nso let's stick with average and now you\ncan see it's labeling the line as\naverage\nwe could also have it label the line as\nthe value so now we can see that the\naverage is this amount of dollars\nor you can choose custom and then you\ncan put something in here\nlike maybe we wanted the computation a\ncolon\nand then the value average\nthis amount\nyou can also have a show recalculated\nline for highlighted or selected data\npoints that means when you click on a\nsection it will recalculate the average\njust for what you've selected we'll hit\nok\nand so in that case when we click on\ntables\nyou can see our\nrecalculated\naverage line\nso the average for tables for just\ntables\nis the sum divided by the number so the\nsum of tables is 206 966 divided by 1 is\nstill 2 6 96 so selecting just tables is\nreally helpful but if we wanted to know\nthe average of\ntables and we'll control click\nappliances\nand we'll control click binders oh there\nwe go all three of those are selected we\ncan see the average of those three which\nis this line\nyou could also select like this\nand see your new average\noh and it's doing the average\nindependently so\nselect these guys and now we see the\naverage of just those\nfive categories and those are reference\nlines now let's duplicate this sheet\nand i'll show you how to delete a\nreference line\nso we'll rename this to reference\nbands\nclick on this reference line\nright click and click remove and it\ntakes it off we have the same thing for\nreference bands we had with reference\nlines where you can have it be for the\nwhole table per pain or per cell so\nlet's do a reference band for the whole\ntable so it's doing entire table\nand it's taking from the minimum to the\nmaximum now we could change the minimum\nto be the average to the maximum and now\nthat will highlight the whole table\neverything that's above the average\nbecomes highlighted\nand if you wanted to change it you could\ndo the minimum to the average\nbut let's go to\naverage to\nmaximum and then you can change things\nlike you can add lines so we have a line\nfor the average of the maximum you can\nmake it thinner you can make it dotted\nyou can change your fill so maybe if you\ndon't want it to be quite that dark you\ncan change it to be a little bit of a\nlighter color of gray\nand you can have show recalculated band\nfor highlighted or you can remove that\nand that way when we highlight stuff\neverything just stays where it belongs\nfor the entire table\nand that's how you create a reference\nband\nreference bands and reference lines can\nbe really handy in making\nseveral different kinds of\nvisualizations such as bullet charts\nif you have any questions about that\nplease comment below and the simply\nlearn team will get back to you now\nlet's do another analysis on average\ndays to ship\nand for this one we're going to\nlook at it by state\nand we're going to look at it by\nship\nmode\nand so we'll take average stasis ship\nand put it on columns\nand now we can see\nthe average days to ship by first class\nsame day second class or standard class\nand you can see\n[Music]\nhow they differ so let's\nchange the order of these really quick\nif we come up here to ship mode and we\nclick sort we click manual we can have\nsame day above first class so that it\nkind of goes in order of priority so\nsame day first class second class\nstandard class\nthere we go and now we have it in\norder of what you might expect and\npriority and now we're going to create a\ncalculated field that we will use to do\na sort of conditional formatting\nand we will name it delay analysis\ngreat so let's do\nif\nthe\naverage days ship\nis less than or equal to 2\nthen\nwe'll have it return the words\nshipment early\nso\nif we want to press enter there that\nwon't cause any problems to our\ncalculation so you can press enter you\ncould have extra spaces and it won't uh\ntableau will ignore those so this allows\nus to format our calculated field in a\nway that's easy to read so if it's less\nthan two then they're going to call it\nan early shipment\nelse if\naverage days to ship is greater than or\nequal to five\nthen shipment\nlate\nand\nelse if let's get the rest of them\nand\naverage days to ship is\nnot less than two\ngreater than two\nand less than\nfive\nthen\non time\ntwo words\non time\nand now you can see we have an error\nhere\nit says expected end to match if that\nmeans that we don't have an end\nat the end of our if statement\nif statements always have to have an end\nokay let's hit apply\nand let's grab our delay analysis and\nput it onto color\nand it has on time as blue\nearly shipment\nas orange\nand shipment lane as red\nwe could double click on the color and\nwe can change shipment early to green\nand now we can see\nthe best ones the on-time ones and the\nones that stand out as late\nand standard class happens late a lot\nit's interesting to see that on average\nthe district of columbia\nhas second class as a legit late\nshipment\nyou can see that all of these\nshare\nthe same axis size so they all go from\nzero to six\neven though this one never gets that\nclose to six\nif we click edit axis\nyou can choose if you want that to be\nthe case so it's like right now all of\nthem use uniform access range for all\nrows and columns and that's really nice\nbecause it's easy to compare\ncolorado to colorado to colorado\nif you change it to independent access\nfor each rose you can see now this one\nonly goes from zero to not even one\nwhereas this one goes from zero to six\nand you can compare it with color but\nyou can no longer compare it with size\nacross all of these different categories\nso uniform access range is the default\nin this case\nand we will keep it that way\nso now we have a quick analysis of our\ndelays\nwe're now going to build a waterfall\nchart\nbased on profit\nso we'll call this our profit\nwaterfall\nand we'll take a look at what a\nwaterfall looks like at the end and talk\nabout how it works\nso after we build it we'll talk about\nsome of the benefits of having a\nwaterfall chart so what we're going to\ndo is build it over time for this\nvisualization we're just going to look\nat the year of 2014\nso i'm going to filter it to the order\ndates for 2014\nand then we're going to take our order\ndate and bring it onto columns and we're\ngoing to look at it by month but we're\ngoing to look at it by\nour discrete month\nso you can see that i chose the one that\nhas month and year\nand then i chose discrete\nand then we're going to take profit and\nput it onto rows and we're going to\nchange it from\nprofit\nto\nour\nrunning total of profit\nso you can see that it takes january and\nthen it adds february to it\nand so it's always getting bigger when\nwe undid it sometimes there's up and\ndown\nso\nback to we only have our running total\nwhere it will some january and february\nfor the february mark and then some\njanuary february march for the march\nmark\nif i take profit\nand put it here you can see january is\nnegative three thousand and february is\npositive two thousand but here it's the\nsum of those which is negative 467.\ntake that back off we're going to change\nour marks to a gaunt bar\nand now we're going to\nduplicate profit\nand edit what we have\nwe're going to call this negative\nprofit\nand it's going to be just profit\nwith the negative sign in front\noh it looks like i've done this before\nso\nnow we have a new name because i added a\nspace at the end so hit apply\nand let's um delete the old one\nokay so now we have our negative profit\njust to look at it it's just minus\nprofit i'm going to use that to\ndetermine the size\nof the gaunt bar\nso\nwhat it does\nis it takes where the line was and it\nadds the size of it to be the size of\nprofit but because the line was at the\ntop and we didn't want to build the\nprofit up we had to change it to\nnegative profit so it would build it\ndown\nso here the line was down here because\nit was so low negative and we added\nnegative profit and then let's take\nprofit and put it on color\nand so you can see where profit is\nnegative it turns it orange\nand when profit is positive it turns it\nblue so what's happening here what we\ncan do now is we can see our total sales\nat the end and how we got there so for\nthe first month we were at zero when we\nstarted and we went down to negative\nthree thousand the next month we were at\nnegative three thousand when we started\nand it grew up to be almost back to zero\nand then we can see that from there on\nout we grew up\neach month and you can see how much each\nmonth contributed\nour biggest contributors are november\nand march november being a little bit\nbigger\nand you can see where we started at the\nbeginning of that month and where we\nended and that's how a waterfall chart\nworks so it lets you go through over\ntime and see exactly where our problems\nwere\nand exactly which months helped the most\nwhere we started and where we ended for\neach month\nnext we're going to talk about level of\ndetail calculation and we'll talk about\nthose first by showing an example so i'm\ngoing to bring all my customers on\nby name and then i'm going to bring on\norder id\nand it's going to add all members but\nthen i'm going to change order id\nfrom a dimension to\na measure and we have account distinct\nso now we can see each customer and how\nmany\norders they have so let's sort it and we\ncan see one person has 17 orders and we\nhave\none two\nthree four\n5 6 7\npeople have 13 orders\nand it goes on from there\nso what if we wanted to make a\nvisualization that would show\nhow many customers\nhad how many orders\nand what\nnumber of orders was the most popular\nwe would need to do a level of detail\ncalculation so let's clear the workbook\na level of detail calculation allows you\nto build a visualization\nand bring on metrics that are at a level\nthat is different from what's shown on\nthe visualization\nso\nin order to do this\nwe need to\ncreate a calculated field\nthat will show us\nthe number of orders per customer\neven though we're not going to have our\nvisualization be per customer\nso let's call this orders\nper customer\nand we'll come here and we're going to\nuse a level of detail calculation called\nfixed\nnow there are two other level of detail\ncalculations\nand they are called include\nand exclude\nand you can learn more about those\nin\nsome of our simply learn classes and if\nyou have any questions please comment\nbelow and we can answer them so we're\ngoing to do it fixed\nand you can choose\ndimensions and it computes an\naggregation using only the specified\ndimensions\nso it will ignore all the other\ndimensions and we're going to have it\nbased on customer name\nso we're going to have fixed customer\nname\nand we're going to call\nget account distinct\nof order id\nand make sure you close it with your\ncurly bracket and we have no errors and\nwe'll hit ok\nand this allows us to see number of\norders per customer so\nlet's pull it out\nfirst let's make it a dimension\nand then pull it out onto our columns\nand now we can see\none two three four five six seven eight\nup to 17. so that means we had\nsome customers just order one and some\ncustomers order 17 and we had them order\neverything in between so if we never had\na customer that had nine orders\nthen nine wouldn't appear in this list\nnow we're going to take customer\nid or name\nlet's do id because it should be unique\nand we'll pull it onto rows and we're\ngoing to change it to a measure\nand it's going to be\naccount distinct\nand so now we can see\nhow many customers ordered\nhow many items\nso\nwe have our number of orders per\ncustomer which is at the per customer\nlevel even though this visualization is\nnot at the per customer level\nthere's nowhere in this visualization\nwhere we pull on the customer\nitem as a dimension\nso let's sort it biggest smallest\nand we can see that 134 of our customers\nordered five items or had five orders\nand so it just five is the most popular\nseven is the next most popular 17 is the\nleast popular one is relatively\nunpopular which is interesting to know\nand so you can use this to analyze how\nmany items your customers generally\norder and maybe if they have four items\nthat they are going to order that\nperhaps if you made good suggestions you\ncould get them to go up to five\nand that's an introduction to level of\ndetail\nso let's name this sheet\nlevel of detail lod\norders per\ncustomer\nperfect\nnow let's make a new sheet\nand we are going to\ndo an analysis about new customers\nso we'll call this level of detail new\ncustomer\nanalysis\nso this visualization is going to be\nabout customer acquisition over time so\nwhen we do things over time we grab our\ndate and pull it up here and for a line\nchart or anything over time\nwe're going to\nuse these\nso that it makes an axis\ninstead of just\nchange to line\ninstead of dimensions or something that\nis not continuous and then we're going\nto take our customer id\npull it onto rows but let's change it to\n[Music]\naccount distinct customer id and now we\ncan see our count of customers on every\nday i think day is too low of a level\nlet's go ahead and month\nso now we can see how many customers\nmade an order during what month\nlet's take region\nand split it out by region\nwe click on central we can see central\nnow this is including all customers\nbut say we only wanted to include a\ncustomer when they're making their very\nfirst order\nso we're only going to include their\nfirst order so we need to create a\ncalculated field\nand we want to compare\nwe'll call it new or existing\nand we want to compare their order date\nper customer\nto their first order date the min\norder date\nnope order date\nand we're going to get this error it\nsays cannot mix aggregate which is min\nand non-aggregate functions and what\nit's saying here is that\nthis order date is at a per row level\nsince we don't have any aggregation on\nit and this order date is at a per\nvisualization level so it's only going\nto split up based on\nthe visualization and it won't let you\nput those two things together so we're\ngoing to\nuse our level of detail calculation\nagain\nand we're going to make this fixed per\ncustomer id\nand then we'll do our min\norder date\nso now instead of\ntrying to return something different\nbased on the visualization it will\nalways return the min for each customer\nid\nso if the order date on the\nvisualization is equal to this order\ndate\nif the order date on the visualization\nis equal to the first order date for\nthat customer\nthen new\nelse\nexisting\nend\nso\nwhen the order date equals the very\nfirst order date that means that it's a\nnew\ncustomer making their first order\notherwise it's an existing customer\nbecause it's no longer their earliest\ndate\napply\nokay and now we can take our new field\nwhich is new or existing drag it onto\nfilters and we only want new\nwe'll hit apply\nand we can see that we have new\ncustomers\nbut\nless over time\nso\nso now we're going to change this\ncount distinct\nto be a running total and we can see\nover time\nhow\nour new customers are adding up so it's\ntaking the prior value and adding our\nnew customers and then at the end we get\nour total customers for each\nregion\nand we can now make this a more\nthe lowest level which is day\nand you can see\nplaces where it like levels out so we\ncan see we have a lot of new customers\nand it's increasing but then here for\nthe region of east there kind of is a\nlevel spot where we're not getting new\norders and that seems to be the same for\neach of them so for february of 2014 why\nwere we not getting any new orders\nand how come the west region is getting\nnew customers how come the west region\nis getting new customers faster here\nwhile it's leveling out in the red\nit looks like the west region\nleveled out as well but picked up sooner\nand started getting new customers\nso this type of analysis will help you\nview\nnew customers over time\nand it's only possible because we were\nable to do a level of detail calculation\nhere on new or existing\nthat would compare\nthis data at\nonly aggregating the data for the\nspecified dimension so we were able to\ngrab their minimum order date here\nso those are a couple of ways that level\nof detail calculations can be very\nhelpful\nin summary today we learned about\nlive versus extract tableau\ndata sources we learned about joins and\nunions in the data sources we also\nlooked at table versus database\ncalculations\nwe looked at how the different ranks\ncompare\nwe built some actions into our\ndashboards filter actions and\nhighlighting actions we also looked at\nurl actions we built dashboards that\nused reference lines and ones that used\nreference bands we did analyzing of\naverage days to ship\nand delay analysis\nwe built a waterfall chart\nand we also looked into some level of\ndetail calculations we will be building\ndashboards from start to finish first\nabout world population then health next\nwe'll build a dashboard about economy\nand finally we'll build a dashboard\nabout businesses i would recommend\ngetting access to the data set before\nyou start this tutorial so you can build\nalong with me if you would like access\nto this data set please comment below\nand we'll get you access\nso first we're going to build a\ndashboard that revolves around\npopulation so we're going to build\na map based on country so i'm going to\ndouble click on country and it's going\nto map out all the countries and then on\nour marks i'm going to change it to map\nso it's a filled in map and we want this\nto be colored by population total\nand we can see\nwho contributes the most to population\nwe're going to label it with population\nas well\nbut you can see that it's labeling it\nthe total population and what we want to\nlabel it is\nhow much it contributes to population by\npercentage so let's add a table\ncalculation and we're going to have it\ndo percent of total\nbased on country\nokay so now we can see which countries\ncontribute what percent\nlet's also bring the country name onto\nthe label\nand let's put it on top so country names\non top now it's getting a little bit of\ncrowded in here so\nwe're going to unclick show marks label\nand we're just going to show the ones\nthat\nwe want to see specifically so we can\nright click on china here hover on mark\nlabel and click always show\nand on india\nsince these are our two biggest\ncontributors\nwe can see that this one's a little bit\ndarker than the others in that area\nand here\nhere\nand that's just a manual way to choose\nwhich ones have indicators labels and\nwhich ones do not\nand we're going to put a note here so\nwe're going to annotate\nan area\nthat explains that\nchina and india\ncontribute the most to world population\njust calling out\nthis section of the visualization\nand let's name this sheet\nso here we have our visualization and\nwhen you hover you can see both the\ntotal population and its percent\ncontribution and the country name\nour next visualization for this\ndashboard is going to be\npopulation over time\nso\n[Music]\nlet's bring on our time element but one\ntrick for bringing on a time element if\nwe just drag it on so year with the\ncalendar mark here if we just drag it on\nit'll default\nto\na discrete version so let's take it back\noff\nand then we could edit it there but one\nthing you could do is if you on\na windows machine you right click on it\nand drag it on then it will pop up\nwith the dialog box that allows you to\nselect what kind of date value you want\nto use in the first place so we're going\nto use year here\nand now we have instead of discrete we\nhave a continuous axis\nand we're going to bring on population\ntotal\nand we can see that over time\none thing you can do when the value is\nup so high\nin your axis is you can uncheck this box\nthat says include zero and it will\nnot always include zero in your axes but\nthis can be misleading so you can see\nthat it looks like population growth is\nsomething really dramatic by increasing\nthat slope of the line\nwhereas it really wasn't quite as\ndramatic as it seems so as long as it's\ncommunicated well and you're not doing\nit to\nmislead your users\nyou just need to keep in mind that this\nincludes zero can change what your graph\nis saying so we're going to\nnot include the zero at this time\njust so that we can focus in on our data\na little bit\nnow we're going to add our forecast so\nwe're gonna click on forecast and drag\nit on\nand it adds the forecast to our\nvisualization right there and now we can\nright click here\nand see forecast result is\nactual and forecast\nso you can see that the forecast picks\nup\nhere in 2012 and pushes out what it\nthinks it'll be in 2013 as well you can\nchange how far out that forecast goes by\nright clicking on the line and clicking\nforecast option\nand we can change this is automatically\nthe next two years but we could change\nit so that it's the next 10 years and it\nwill go out into the future\nout to 2022\nyou can change prediction intervals or\nif you don't want to show them you don't\nhave to show them and this is just kind\nof a visual guide for those prediction\nintervals\nokay and then you can also\nhave your trend lines show\nwhere it shows your trend line following\nout from where your population growth is\nand also the trend line for your\nforecast right there\nand we'll call this\npopulation\ntrend\nexcellent and we're going to make one\nmore visualization for this\nand it's going to be a pie chart so the\npie chart is also going to be based off\nof population\nso we're going to click on population\nand we're going to control click on\ncountry and come over to show me\nand click your pie chart\nso i'm going to make this\nthe entire view so we can see the pie\nchart better\nand this is getting really crazy in here\nand so i have changed my mind and\ninstead of country i'm going to drag\nregion over top of country and now we\nsee something a little bit more\nmanageable so we can see that here's\nasia\nand it makes up\nthe biggest piece of the pie and then\nhere is everybody else so right now\neach of these is population total\nand we could keep it that way or we\ncould\ndo what we did last time\nand change it to percent of total\nso that on hover we can see the\npopulation\nand\nthe percentage of population that it\ncontributes\nso for this pie chart we're just going\nto\nshow asia versus everybody else so we\nneed to make a group and what we'll do\nis\nselect all of these\nand we're going to right click and click\ngroup\nso now we have\nall those things we selected and we have\nother let's edit our group\nright click edit group\nwe're going to\nrename this group\nasia because\nthat's all that's in there and we're\ngoing to rename this group\nrest of the world\nokay\nso now we have our group we can drag it\nonto label and we can see asia and rest\nof the world and now see how it's\nbreaking it up into those different\nsections that's because we still have\nregion on\nour\ndetail right here so we pull region off\nnow let's just split asia rest of the\nworld\nwe can change our colors\nmake it a little bit more\nvisually interesting\nnow we can still see our percentages\nand now let's rename it and then we'll\nput it all together on a dashboard\ngreat so let's make our dashboard we\nhave this new dashboard button down here\nand you can choose what sizes you want\nso we have a fixed size where you just\nselect the width and height we have\nautomatic which will just fill your\nscreen\nand\nwe have a range which has a minimum size\nand a maximum size\nsome of the\ngood things about fixed is that once you\nhave it you can have it always look that\nway so no matter where they're looking\nat it you know that it's going to be\nlaid out the way that you expected\nhowever if somebody's looking out on a\nscreen that is bigger or smaller than\nyours then it doesn't fill up the screen\nor it will fill the screen too much and\nthey'll have to scroll up and down and\nleft and right\nif you have automatic then it will fit\nthe screen that it's displayed on\nhowever\nthe things that you've placed might get\nsquished too close together\nand then the range gives you a minimum\nsize and a maximum size meaning if the\nscreen is too big\nit still won't fill up the screen but it\ncan get closer and then as they get\nsmaller and smaller screens\nyou at least know that it will never\nmake it get smaller than this particular\nsize so there's some benefits to that as\nwell where you still have a little bit\nof control of what it will look like in\nthe end\ngreat let's bring on our worksheets\nand you can see that where you hover\nit fills up that space and that's where\nit's going to show up you can also\nadjust the lines in between different\nvisualizations for things that need more\nspace or less space\nanother important thing to recognize is\nthat when you click on a visualization\nlike this one up here it will tell you\nhow it's viewing that visualization\nwithin that space so if you click\nstandard\nthen it will do a standard fit\nversus if you have\nentire view where it will\nmake it fit into inside the box over\nhere we could have fit width\nor fit height on some of the\nvisualizations it doesn't make as much\nof a difference however when you have a\nvisualization that maybe has a lot of\ntext in it and they need to be able to\nscroll you'll want to have it fit width\nbut you don't want it to fit height\nbecause then it will shove all of that\ninformation\ninto the box and not allow you to scroll\nup and down\nso as you saw as we dragged these on it\ntook\nthese\nlegends and added it to the left here\nwe can modify that\nand make them floating\nand drag them next to the visualizations\nthat they\nare relevant to\nand\nthis particular one\nhas a couple of things wrong with it we\nmight not want the title of this to be\nregion group\nso we could come in and we could edit\nthe title and then\nmaybe just call it region\nhowever i don't think we need this\nlegend at all because it's very clearly\nmarked on the visualization there so you\ncould also just remove it from the\ndashboard\nand this one\nis telling you how big of a circle\nit would need to be before it gets to\nthat population number so\nit belongs to this circle as well\nbut again\nis unnecessary potentially because we\nhave our two population numbers\nshowing up right as we hover\nso we remove that as well so at this\npoint we have a visualization or three\nvisualizations all on the same page\nwhich is the basics of a dashboard\nhowever we might want to be able to\ninteract with them a little bit more\nthan just hovering\nand so this is where we should look into\nadding filters so we have information\nover time we have information by country\nand we have some information by region\nhere\none of the quickest things you can do to\nadd functionality to the dashboard is by\nclicking this uses filter button so if\nwe click this that means whatever\ncountry we click on here\nwill filter the other visualization\nand then you can unselect it\nto go back\nnow\nthat\nuses filter button\nactually creates an action here\nfilter one generated that it's made on\nits own now you can see that when we\nclick on\nchina\nit doesn't make a lot of sense to have\nthis pie chart update based on that\nchina click because\nit's just going to show\nduplicated information so it shows the\n20\nor the 20 here and the 17\nbillion\nand then here it does the same thing\nexcept for it shows 100 because it's\nfiltered everything else out of the\nchart so it now makes up 100 of the\ncircle so that doesn't make a lot of\nsense\nso there are ways to\nformat your visualization or your\nactions\nmodify your actions so that they only\naffect the things that make sense so we\ncan come here and click edit\nwe're going to call this country\naction\nand we want it to\nuse the population by country sheet and\nthen modify\nonly the trend\nso now when we click on\nchina we see china's trend over time and\nit doesn't affect our pie\nbecause that doesn't make sense for it\nto affect our pie we might want to\nselect\non our pie\nasia or rest of the world and have that\naffect the other visualization so we can\nclick use this filter here and click\nasia\nand now it zooms into asia on our map\nand shows us just the asia world\npopulation trend and here's rest of the\nworld and we can see that asia is grayed\nout\nand there's the rest of the world and\nhere's the rest of the world population\ntrend\nwe might also want to be able to use\nthis to filter to a certain year\nso if we click use filter\nthen we click on\n2011\nyou can see these numbers are slightly\nupdating so this is 19\nand we come here 19.5 percent\ncome down here and we can see that the\npi updates a little bit\nalthough it hasn't been anything\ndramatic\nyou can kind of see it over time\nso that's one way\nto add filters to your visualization\nanother way\nis to use actual filtering instead of\njust actions so if we come back here to\nour trend we could take the year we're\ngoing to control click and drag it onto\nfilters\nand now we have a year filter so we\ncould have it the actual year number so\njust look at one year at a time or a\nrange of dates\nso if we click range of dates that makes\nthis slider\nfrom 2000 to 2012. so if we hit ok\nwe'll right click and we'll click show\nfilter we can see it here and as we drag\nthis it updates\nbut kind of messes with our forecast\nso let's not do a year filter\nin this case\nso we click remove filter there\nbut maybe we want a filter just on this\nfor the different years\nso let's drag year onto the filters\nwe're just going to do the year number\nnext and here's all the years we're\ngoing to let all of them be selected for\nnow\nand then we're going to show the filter\nand here's all of our years\nand we can change the way that our quick\nfilter shows up\nand we can make it like a drop down so\nthey can still select multiples but it's\na drop down or maybe we want this\nvisualization to be just one year at a\ntime so we can choose single value in a\nlist and it lists out all the years or\nin a drop down\nand we want it to be 2012.\nand\nthen we want this to show up on our\ndashboard so we come to the dashboard\nand we click more options here hover\nover filters and we can see the filters\navailable and we can click year of year\nand now our formatting hasn't passed on\nso that's one thing to remember that\nformatting it just on the workbook\ndoesn't necessarily mean that the\nformatting will pass over to the\ndashboard so\ni tend to not do any formatting on the\nworkbooks and just format it on the\ndashboards because the dashboards are\nwhat i publish\nso we're going to single value drop down\nwe're going to\n[Music]\nadd it we're going to move it to the top\nso now how we do that\nlet's talk a little bit about what each\nof these sections are\ncome here to layout\nand you can see we have this layout here\nitem hierarchy so tiled is the whole\nscreen and inside of that we have a\nhorizontal\ncontainer\nand inside this horizontal container we\nhave another horizontal container and\nwhen you click on something in this view\nit shows you where it exists\nso we can see this horizontal container\nis outlined now and then we change it to\nvertical and it outlines this now a\nhorizontal container allows things to be\nside by side\nand a vertical container allows things\nto be a one on top of the other and so\nin our vertical container we see all\nthis extra space for extra things to be\non top of each other but if we wanted to\nhave it at the top\nwe would maybe want things to be able to\nbe side by side so if we go back to the\ndashboard and we grab horizontal and\ndrag it to the top\nit adds a horizontal container up here\nand now you can see everything that's\nfloating kind of stays in the place that\nit was\neven though all the other things shifted\nso that's one of the disadvantages of\nfloating is that you're kind of just\nmanually choosing\nwhere it will stand\nusing your x and y position\nand it's not dynamic\nso let's give us a little bit less space\nup here\nwe can add a text box into\nour horizontal container\nand we will say\npopulation dashboard\nwe can format it\nnow we have our title up here and then\nwe can add our filter\nwe're going to drag it to be on\ninside of our horizontal container but\non the\nside\nhere can give it more or less space\nlet's bring\nour legends down to places where they\nmake sense again\nperfect and so now\nwe have this\nthat will affect this\nonly\nand show you just 2012\n2011 2010. so we don't want it to affect\nthe trend because we want the trend to\nshow\nall of time and just looking at one year\nfor this trend that is only at a yearly\npart and forecasts into the future\ndoesn't make any sense but we maybe\nwanted to also affect this worksheet so\nthat these two are in sync\nand so the dashboard is basically for\n2012 except for the trend which shows\nyou the past in the future so one way\nthat you can do that is clicking apply\nto worksheets here\nand you can choose selected worksheets\nand it will show you all the worksheets\nin this visualization\nor in this dashboard\nand you can click show all worksheets in\nworkbook and then if there were other\nworksheets it would show them so we\nwanted to do asia versus rest of the\nworld and population contribution by\ncountry\nokay and that's another way we can\nchange what year they show so it's only\ngoing to show one year at a\ntime unless we select all\nand then this visualization isn't\naffected by it\nif we don't want\nto\nclick on a country and have it\nmake the change if we instead want to\nhave a filter for country we can do that\nby taking country and dragging it onto\nfilters\nwe'll have it show all for now\nand then when we go back to our\ndashboard and we come to this\nvisualization we can go filters and add\ncountry\nand it's just added it side by side\nwhere we had our other filters so that's\na nice\nfeature of tableau where it can kind of\nguess where you might want things we're\ngoing to do multiple value drop down\nand right now\nit only affects that visualization and\nwe can just look at one country at a\ntime\nand we might not want it to affect this\nvisualization because it doesn't do us\nany good to just look at one region in a\npie chart\nbut maybe we wanted to affect the world\npopulation trend so we can do the same\nthing we did before\nand we wanted to affect these two\nwe'll click ok\nand so now\nwe could look at\nall these countries\nand that would update both these\nvisualizations\nanother thing i like to do\non a filter\nis customize and click show apply button\nand this means we can make all these\nchanges in here\nsee i've selected none however these\nvisualizations aren't updating and then\ni wanted to look at turkey so i found\nturkey and then i hit apply and that's\nwhen they update\nperfect\nso now we have a dashboard complete with\nfilters and\nactions\nwe also have a title on our dashboard we\ncan give it a little bit less space and\nsome legends\nwe have titles on each of these pieces\nhowever if we didn't want a title here\nwe can click hide title and it will just\nshow our visualization there and this is\ndashboard number one\nhere's what it looks like in full screen\nmode full screen mode is a good\nopportunity for you to test it to see\nwhat it will look like to the end user i\npress escape and get back out and it\ndoesn't give you these highlights when\nyou hover over things that are\ndashboard formatting related\nyou can see that all those extra lines\nwent away\nand it just gives you the opportunity to\ntest out your dashboard in a more real\nway\nand see how they will use it\ninstead of giving you the dashboard\nediting options\nnext we're going to make a dashboard\nrevolving around health information\nso first we're going to make\na map\nabout birth rates so we're going to call\nit\nbirth rate\nrank\nand to make a map we're going to double\nclick on country\nand\nwe're going to change it to a map type\nso we have a filled map here and then\nwe're going to bring birth rate on to\ncolor\nso let's define our colors a little bit\nby clicking on this color part of the\nmarks card\nwe'll click edit colors and we're going\nto change it\nto\nred and gold\nand the idea here is that the red is for\na higher birth rate which is\nmore associated with countries that have\npoor health so we'll hit apply\nand now we have our\nhigher birth rate countries highlighted\nin red\nnext we're going to create\na class so we're going to duplicate\nbirth rate\nand let's edit that field\nwe're going to call it birth rate class\nand so we're going to say that anything\nthat is in the top 50 countries\nwith the highest birth rate is\ncategorized as having\nan alarming birth rate so we will\nfirst do the average\nbirth rate\nand then we're going to\ndo a rank\non that\ndo you see sometimes\nwhen you're auto-completing your\nstatements\nit will replace\none of these functions that you have\nwith the one that you pressed tab for so\nif i type if or i start to type if and\nthen i come here and click on if it\nreplaced my rank with if so keep an eye\nout for that if you're like where did my\nthing go it's because i was typing it\nright next to it so if i put a space and\nthen i start to type if and i click if\nit will not delete rank so we're going\nto say if\nthe rank of average is\nless than or equal to\n50 so if it's in the top 50\nthen\nalarming birth rate\nelse if\nand we could take this again\nis greater than 50\nthen\nnormal over three\nand\nalways make sure you put on the end also\nwe didn't necessarily have to have this\nelse if statement\nso if we had just done else normal birth\nrate that would have covered all of our\nbases so with these if statements just\nmake sure that you're always getting all\nthe different options\nthat you want but in this case\nwe defined both however we didn't have\nto define the second calculation because\nif it is not in the top 50 then it's\nobviously in the bottom the rest\nso we're going to hit ok\nand then we're going to put birth rate\nclass onto label\nand it's gone around and labeled\neverything\nand i am seeing alarming birth rate on\neverything\nso let's see what the problem is\nso if we open this back up by right\nclicking and clicking edit you can see\nit says results are computed a long\ntable across\nso we're going to click default table\ncalculation here and instead of compute\nusing automatic we're going to change it\nto compute using\ncountry we'll hit ok\nand hit apply\nand that didn't seem to fix it so this\nis the first place i would look if it's\nnot doing what you would expect so\nwe'll put it back to automatic okay\nthe second place i would look is inside\nof the table calculation that is created\nso when we defined rank here\nwe put a table calculation on it so when\nwe right click here we get edit table\ncalculation\nand we're going to choose that we want\nto do the rate based on\nthe specific dimension of country\nso now we can see\nusing the logic\nthe calculation assistance that\nwe no longer have just alarming birth\nrate we have normal birth rate and\nalarming birth rate on our screen so we\ncan close this\nand\nwe are done here but one thing you could\ndo\nis\nwhen we have allow labels to overlap\nother marks selected then it will make\nsure that\nevery label shows up but it gets super\ncrazy in there so there are some times\nwhere the labels may overlap a little\nbit and so you'll want to select this\noption in our case we don't want that\nand now we have a visualization\nshowing\nbirth rate map\nbased on rank our next visualization\nis going to be about\naverage life expectancy\nmale versus female\nso we're going to do\na chart across time so we're going to\nclick year and bring it on to columns\nand we're going to change it to\nthis\nyear\nin the continuous section so now we have\nan axis\nand\nwe're going to\ndouble click on female life expectancy\nup\nthere we go double click on female like\nexpectancy and then double click on male\nlife expectancy so what that did was\nmade us two charts\none on top of the other but we don't\nwant that so we'll take this off and\nwe're going to drag male life expectancy\nright onto this axis for the female life\nexpectancy\nand what this has done is made what's\ncalled a blended axis chart so it's not\na dual axis chart where we have another\naxis over here\nfor the second visualization this one is\na blended axis chart so they necessarily\nuse the same axis and they necessarily\nhave the same kinds of marks so we'll\ntake a look and see what the difference\nis there so if i were to change this to\na bar chart we would have\nbar chart for both of them and i can't\ndefine one separately from the other\nchange it back to a line chart\nand they're both a line chart now if we\ngo back to\nwhen we just had female life expectancy\nand we drag\nmale on next to it and we have two\ncharts now we can change it to a dual\naxis and we have one on top of the other\nhowever our axes don't line up we can\nsee at the top here is 15k and over here\nit's 14k\nso we're going to synchronize the axis\nand you can see\none on top of the other\nand\nwe have two marks cards so we could have\nthis one be a bar chart and that would\nbe a line chart so that's some of the\ndifferences of those two we're going to\ndo a blended axis chart so i'm going to\ntake male and drag it here\nand we have our blended access chart and\nnow you can see the our scale here\nis really strange so what it's doing is\nit's adding up all of the life\nexpectancies for all the different\ncountries instead of averaging it so\nwe're going to change that by right\nclicking on the measure down in this\nmeasure values card hovering over\nmeasure sum and we're going to change it\nto average\nsince i only changed one of them and\nthey share the same axes it's really\nspread out now and it almost looks like\na straight line down there and then\nlet's change the other\nand it should get everything a little\nbit more\nin sync there we go so now we can see\nthe average life expectancy over time\nwhich for both of them seems to be going\nup\nhowever\nit seems to be higher for females\nnow let's take a look at our analytics\nand let's\ndrag on forecast\nso it's forecasted out the next two\nyears for both line\nand we'll bring on trend\nonto linear\nand let's change it\nto a square so now we see\neach individual point for the life\nexpectancy for females and males and we\ncan see what they're expected to be in\nthe future\nand our trends\nand our next visualization\nis going to be a heat map\nabout\nmultiple different\nmeasures so we'll just call it a heat\nmap for now\nand for our heat map we're going to look\nat the different countries so we'll\nbring crunchy onto rows and we're going\nto look at\ntheir\nbirth rate so i just double clicked on\nbirth rate and brought it on\nwe're going to look at\ntheir health expenditure percentage on\ngdp so how much they spend on\ngdp\nso when i double clicked on it it did\nwhat we did before where we have a\nmeasures value card and so now whenever\nwe put measures on here that determines\nwhat goes here because we have our\nmeasured names on columns so every\nmeasure in here their name is going to\ndefine the name of the column and the\nvalues\ndefine\nwhat's in the text right here\ngreat we're also going to bring on\ninfant mortality rate\nand\nthe life expectancy for females\nokay\nso now it has\nchanged these to not have decimal points\nafter them which is not as helpful so\nwe're going to\nformat those\nand you can format it field by field so\nfor birth rate\nwe definitely want to have\ndecimals afterwards\nas a matter of fact the birth rate is a\npercentage so instead of doing a number\nstandard we'll just go to percentage\nand now we don't need to have those\ndecimals afterwards we can just look at\nthe birth rate as a rate\nand for\npercent of gdp for health expenditures\nwe can come click there and do the same\nthing\nand for infant mortality rate\nokay\nand to make this make a little bit more\nsense we again need to change it from a\nsum\nto an average\nand for some of these\nwe could\nchange it from a sum to an average right\ninside of\nthe\nfor all of these we could change it from\na sum to an average in the default\nproperties\nunder aggregation\nso it will automatically average it\nwhenever we bring it out\ndefault is sum\nbut if we make it automatically average\nthen we won't have to do that again for\nany other visualizations\ni won't do that at this time because i\nget a little bit confused sometimes when\ni don't have my sum on there by default\nbecause that's what i'm so used to\nseeing by default great so we now have\na matrix\nby country and by our different metrics\nhere and so we can\ntake our measure values\nand drag it on to color\nand we'll make our marks from automatic\nto square\nand it will make our heat map\nnow what happens with a heat map\nis it colors darkly\nthe higher the number it is in this case\nand right now it's doing it for the\nwhole area so one percent is obviously\nmuch much smaller than 82 but if we\nwanted to be able to look at birth rate\nindependently from life expectancy we\ncan right click on the measure values on\nthe color and click use separate legends\nand so now we have a legend\nfor each one of these let's change the\ncolors on those legends so that we can\nsee them separately a little bit more\nclearly\nso we'll change the colors by coming\nover here to each of the legends\nand we'll leave one the same\nbut we'll change this one\nand if we click edit colors you can see\nour different palettes\nyou can see some of them just have one\ncolor others have one color to another\ncolor we used the\nred gold before\nso now you can see that one is changed\nwe could use\nanother one that goes from\ngreen to blue\ngreat\nyou can also define your own\nso you can make a custom one that could\ngo from\nlight to dark and then you can choose\nwhat color you want as your dark color\nso we could pick\na lighter blue\nand then we see that last one\nand now with these separate color\npalettes you can quickly see the\ndifference with birth rate and\nspending on health\nand that is our heat map\nwith\nseparate legends\nso let's build this all into a dashboard\nnow\nwe're going to call it our health\ndashboard\nand for simplicity we're going to make\nit automatic so it fills our screen\nand then we're going to first bring on\nour map\nwe're going to bring on our health\nrelated map with birth rates\nthen we're going to bring on our\nheat map\nand we'll bring on our life expectancy\nlines\nnow as we brought on all of our charts\nit brought in our legends here\nand we're going to move our legends up\nto the top so let's add a horizontal\ncontainer\nand then let's put\nour legends\ninto the horizontal container\nand let's put these ones in order so\nlife expectancy\noh\nso birth rate is going to be over here\ngreat now\none thing we can do is make these\nsmaller\nwell that's actually just making that\none bigger huh okay\nso it would make them smaller\nby making something else bigger or by\nadding in a blank space\nwhich would then\nhelp you adjust the size\nby taking up the space that you're not\nusing\nanother thing to pay attention to is\nthis fixed width so once you start to\ndrag the size on something it no longer\nis dynamic\nso if we unfix that width\nso that it's only taking up whatever\nspace is left oh and that one is not\nfixed with\nand then we can edit the width on this\nto be\neven bigger\nthen it will squish things over to where\nwe would like them to be so\nthat's one of the ways you can add space\nor make things the size you would like\nthem to be\nnow let's take a look at filters oh\nbefore we take a look at filters i want\nto look at this map one more time\nbecause i think that it would be useful\nfor our colors to be\na little bit more distinct\nso\none quick way to navigate to your\nworksheet from your dashboard is to\nclick this go to sheet button\nand while we're here i'm going to click\non color\nedit colors and we did red and gold and\nwe're going to change it from this\nsequence to a stepped color\nand we're going to change it to three\ncolors so it's going to either be\nthis color this color this color i want\nto hit okay\nyou can kind of see it's a little bit\nmore dramatic\nin our differences and it's put\neverything into the three categories we\ndefined so let's go back to our\ndashboard\nand we can see the difference there\nand now we're going to take a look at\nour filters so we want to be able to\nfilter by country\nso let's bring country onto filters\nnow we're going to allow it to use all\nand we're going\nto here you can click apply to\nworksheets\nand you can click selected worksheets\nand it's going to pop up with all the\nworksheets\nin the whole workbook\nand so one disadvantage of doing it on\nthe worksheet is that you can see all of\nthe worksheets in the workbook and you\nhave to differentiate between which ones\nare on the dashboard which ones aren't\nand these are the three on this\ndashboard so we're going to hit ok\nand we're also going to do it by year so\nwhen we drag the year onto filters\nwe're going to\n[Music]\nallow them to\nchoose years so we're going to do\nthe distinct number of years we'll click\nuse all\nokay\nand we're going to apply to the\nworksheets\nthis one with the birth rate and the\naverage life expectancy male versus\nfemale we're not going to filter down\nour line chart by year\nbecause we want to be able to see it\nover time and if we filter down the time\nthen we don't get as much context so\nwe'll hit ok\nlet's go back to our dashboard\nif i click on more options here and\nhover over filters you can see that year\nfilter and that country filter\nyou should also be able to see both of\nthose filters on the heat map\nbecause i told it to apply to that one\nas well so here's the country oh\ni made a mistake let's go back to this\nvisualization\nand\napply to worksheets selected worksheets\nsee i wanted it to be on the birth rate\nand the heat map not the line chart and\ni clicked the wrong one\nso that was a good test\nso when we go here to the heat map\nand click down\nyou can see now\nwe get the year of year as well so we'll\nclick year of year let's put it over\nhere\nand we're going to make it\na multiple values drop down and we'll\nbring it over\nto the middle\nand let's also\nget the countries filter\ngreat so now that we have these in here\nwe don't need this to be so big so let's\nedit the width\nand make it\n300\neven smaller\n200\ngreat and let's change our country\nto be\na single value drop down so you can pick\none at a time and let's also change it\nor this year of year since we can select\nmultiples let's change it so that\non customize that you show the apply\nbutton\nso here since they can only select one\nwe don't have the apply button because\nit will just automatically apply\nand here since they can select multiples\nwe'll let them unselect all and pick\ntheir years and then hit apply and then\nyou'll see the changes\nand you can see that even though i've\nselected only 2011 and 2012 you still\nsee all the years on this line chart as\nexpected\nand there\nis our health dashboard\nour next dashboard is going to have to\ndo with economy\nour first sheet is going to be\nanother map that is going to have to do\nwith overall gdp\nand\nas we usually begin with maps by double\nclicking on country\nand changing it to a map mark type\nand this time we're going to bring on\ngdp onto color\nand change it to average\nand we can edit the colors\nlet's this time do\na custom diverging so you get to pick\nboth colors\nand let's pick\na little bit lighter\nhmm\nokay red for there and then we want to\ndo maybe like a deeper\ngreen\nand that way\nyou can see\nwho has the highest gdp which is green\nwe hit apply\nokay and then it will\neventually get lighter and lighter until\nit goes to gray which then it will lead\nto green\nokay\nand next we're going to make scatter\nplot\nwhich we will call\ngdp versus gdp per capita\nso\ngdp or gross domestic product versus\ngross domestic product per capita or per\nperson\nand to make a scatter plot\nyou have one\nmeasure on one axis\nand then another measure which is going\nto be gdp per capita which we will now\ncreate\non the other axis\nso let's start with gdp and we'll hit\nduplicate\nand let's edit that and we're going to\ncall it\ngdp\nper capita\nand we're going to take\nsum\nof gdp\ndivided by the sum\nof the total\npopulation\npopulation total\nwhat is my error\nopening parenthesis\nthere we go\nand then we have gdp per capita so let's\nwhat this will do is sum up the gdp\nacross whatever measures we have in\nplace go across whatever dimensions we\nhave in place and then sum up the\npopulation for those same dimensions and\nthen divide it instead of dividing it\nper row\nand then\ndoing an aggregation on it\nokay\nso now we're going to bring on gdp per\ncapita on the rows\nand we have the sum of gdp and the gdp\nper capita and to make it more than just\none\nlittle mark on our scatter plot we will\ndrag on country to detail and now we\nhave one mark per country\nand you can see some countries have\na high gdp per capita\nand some countries have a high\ngdp overall but not as high of a gdp per\ncapita\nand so on we have some middle of the\nroad people here so we can change this\nfrom automatic\nto\ncircles and now they're dots like you\nmight see on scatter plot\nand you can\ndrag region\nonto\ncolor\nand now we can see our different regions\nand see we see a lot of reds here\n[Music]\nand it's quick to see\nwhat region things belong in also you\ncan click to highlight and you can see\nall of the americas highlighted in\ncontext\nthe next visualization we're going to\nmake\nis going to be\nshowing\nhow much country spend on health care\na part of their gdp so we're going to\nrename it\nto be gdp on healthcare\nand we're going to look at each of our\ncountries\nand we're going to make a bar chart\nthat shows\nthe health expense gdp\nand we're going to change this to\naverage\nand we're also going to show\nthe health expense per capita\nover here it shows how much is spent per\nperson on health\nand this\nis showing how much\nis spent on health\nbased on gdp\nclick at the top and click sort and it's\nsorting by this first one\nand you can see which countries spend\nthe most of their gdp on health we can\nagain bring region onto color\nso we can see the different\nregions\nhighlighted\nand\nlet's bring on labels so\nfor our different marks cards\nwe're going to want to control click\nthis and drag it onto the labels\nand we can see that it's a percentage\nbut it's coming up as a number so\nwe can right click and click\nformat right there\nand\nwe're going to change the number to\npercentage\nmaybe just do one decimal place\nand then for this one\nwe're going to control\nand drag\nthat onto labels\nand maybe we'll change this one to\ncurrency\nhowever if you don't want to change it\nto currency\nsince we aren't sure\nnecessarily what currency this data set\nis in um it's worth checking out\nwhat currency it is in\nso for now we'll just have it as a\nnumber\nand now we're going to\ncustomize our tool tip\nso we're going to go to the overall\nmarks card\nand we'll click on tool tip and we want\nit to tell us the country in the top so\nerase region\nand we're going to\nerase country label and center country\nand then we're going to\nput\nthis country\nspends\nthis percentage\non healthcare\nand if you want to preview it you can\nhover or click here on preview and it\nwill show you an example marshall island\nspends 2.1 on healthcare we'll hit enter\nand then when we hover\nit tells you the country and it has our\ncustom tooltip on both visualizations or\non both\nof the different axes\nso let's build our dashboard\nwe'll bring on our map\nwe'll bring on our\nhealthcare\nvisualization\nand our gdp versus gdp per capita\nand we'll move our legends to the top\nagain\nby adding a horizontal container to the\ntop\nand bringing them up here\none thing we can do also\nis to give this more space\nwe can have it go all the way to the top\nand these legends are just side by side\njust above the map\nand uh jbp per capita\nscatter type plot\nan interesting thing you can do in\ntableau is you can see this outlier of\nthe united states is making it difficult\nto see the rest of the information or to\nvisualize if there's any trend there\nso you could right click on it and click\nexclude\nand then it will exclude it from your\ndata set very quickly\nand then you'll just click this back\nbutton to get it back\ngreat now let's take a look at filters\nwe are going to do a single filter\nso let's go to this visualization and\nwe'll bring on country\nwe'll click use all\nokay\nand we're going to apply it to\nworksheets so i showed you how we can\napply it to worksheets here\nyou can also apply it to worksheets once\nit's on the dashboard so if we come here\nand look at filters we can see the\ncountries on the filters for this\nvisualization\nbut if we come down here\nand look at filters\nwe still see country because it's in the\ndetails of the information so\neither way when we add country\nsince i added it from this visualization\nit only affects this visualization\nokay\nbut we want it to affect all on the\nworksheet\nso we're going to apply to worksheets\nand we can click selected worksheets and\nwe can click all on dashboard\nokay\nlet's bring this over here we're going\nto allow them to see all at once and be\nable to scroll and select the ones they\nwant and now\nwhen we select different ones it affects\nall three worksheets\nwe're also going to add an action\nfor a url action add action go to url\nand when we click on a country on the\noverall gdp map we want it to take us to\nthe wikipedia page that talks about the\neconomy for that country\nso that is this url and it's going to\nsay\nwikipedia for economy of\nand we're going to add our country to\nthe end\nso we hit okay\nwe have it running on menu so let's\nchange it to run on select and as soon\nas you click it it will take you there\nokay so now let's try it\nand we can click on\ncanada\nand it will take us to the wikipedia\npage for the economy of canada\ngreat we click on brazil\nsame thing\nso if we unselect on brazil then it will\nmake our map highlighted normally again\nwe can also use this one to filter the\nother visualizations\nand so we could click use this filter\nhere and then when we click on france\nit will filter these two other\nvisualizations to france\nyou can see that when we filter this\nvisualization\nto a particular country\nso if we look at\ngermany\ngermany wasn't green before on our map\nbut now it is that happens because our\nscale has changed just for the ones\nselected\nso if we control click france and\ngermany and switzerland\nand austria we now have a scale that\nreflects only these countries and the\nbiggest is going to be the darkest green\nor the highest gdp is the darkest green\nand the lowest is the lightest pink\nand there is our economy dashboard you\ncan see that we have some nulls on these\nvisualizations that occurs when we don't\nhave all of the data\nfor every point\nyou can ignore those and they won't show\nup on the final visualization\nwhen you publish it to server or you can\ndeal with those by clicking on them and\nfiltering that data out or showing that\ndata at the default position which is\nshowing the null values at zero our\nfinal dashboard is going to be about the\nease of doing business in a country so\nour first visualization is going to be a\nbar chart which we will call days to\nstart\nbusiness\nso how many days it takes to start a\nbusiness is important to know when\nyou're trying to start a business in a\ncountry and also can be an indicator of\nhow easy it will be to do business in\nthat country so\nlet's make a bar chart that includes\nevery country and then we're going to\nbring on days to start a business\nand we will sort it smallest biggest\nand we have some days\nor some countries that don't have\nany days so let's filter out those\ncountries\nand we're going to\nfilter it to only those that have\na good market\nwe're going to make a calculated field\nwe're going to define business friendly\nmarket\nwell\nwe're going to define our market based\non how easy it is to start a business\nand how many days it takes so if it\ntakes less than 25 days to start a\nbusiness we'll consider that a good\nmarket\nand so we're going to do\nif\nthe days to start a business is less\nthan or equal to 25\nthen\nelse if\nspace to start a business\nis\ngreater than\n25\nthen\nbusiness\nmight or might not\nwork\ndoing less than or equal to 25 or\ngreater than 25\nallows us to be able to define these two\ndifferent markets so we'll hit\napply there\nand we're going to filter it\njust to a good market\nand we're going to look at\njust one year\nlook at 2012\nour most recent year\nand we're going to color it based on\nregion\nand we can see\nwhich regions tend to have\nthe shorter days to start a business\nand we're going to\nmove on and build our next visualization\nwhich is also a bar chart\nwhich we will call ease of business\nso we have this ease of business field\nand we can bring on the country and we\ncan bring on ease of business\nand we want to\nmake it\na measure so ease of business is at this\npoint looking at it like it's\na string\nand we can change that in our default\nproperties and convert it to a measure\nor use it up here and change it to a\nmeasure\nwhen we try to change it to a measure\nhere it wants to treat it like a string\nso it wants to take the minimum or the\nmaximum\nbut if we here convert it to a measure\nthen it also automatically made it a\ncount\nso the first thing to do\nwould be to change the data type to a\nnumber\nand now\nwe can change it to a measure and\naggregate it so we could do\nlike the sum of ease of business\nin our use case we're actually going to\ndo the\naverage of ease of business\nand then we want to have the smallest on\nthe top we do have some that don't have\nease of business ratings\nso we're going to filter that data out\nand again we want the year to be 2012\nbut how we're going to do that is by\ncoming to this visualization\nand by applying this particular year of\n2012 so we'll do it on select workbooks\nand select ease of business okay\nand now this one also has\nthe year of 2012 there\nand\nwe're going to\nsegment this by creating another header\nwe're going to call that\nbusiness\nfriendly\nand we're going to say\nthat if the ease of business\nis\nso i guess this is a nice thing to know\nso if if we start typing in what we want\nto see then we can select it from a list\nhere but you can also interact outside\nof this box so you could just grab ease\nof business and drag it into the dialog\nbox here and that's really nice so we're\ngoing to say if it is greater than or\nequal to one\nand less than or equal to\nthree\nthen\nwe're going to say it has the most\nbusiness\nfriendly\nregulations\ngive us a little more room to look at\nokay and this statement won't work\nbecause it's saying and what is less\nthan or equal to three so you have to\nhave ease of business in both places\nand then this should say then and not\nthe\ngreat so now we're just getting an error\nbecause we don't have an end\nso if that's all we wanted to do then\nthat's what we would do but then we'll\njust do another else if\nand it's already taken this\nif statement goes through\none condition at a time so it's already\nclassified everything that's between\nthese two numbers and so\nnow we can just say\nif ease of business\nis\nless than or equal to\nten then\nwe'll call it very\nvery business friendly regulations\nnow we'll keep going\nelse if ease of business is\nless than or equal to 50\nthen\nwe're going to call it\nmoderate\nand we're just going to say moderate\nbusiness\nregulations\ncopy that for later use\nless than equal to 150\nthen\nstrict\nso\nthe reason that this doesn't grab\neverything that is less than or equal to\n150 is because\nthese sections one to three and then\nthree or well 4 to 10\nand then 11 to 50 have all been\nclassified up to this point so it's just\ngetting everything else\nand we're going to\nfinally\nsay else everything else\nis going to be called\nnot preferred\nfor\nbusiness\nand see if we get any errors calculation\nis valid let's see if this works as we\nexpect so we'll hit apply and we'll\nbring business friendly onto our rows\nand now it categorizes everything\nbased on what we said so\nwe want to define what order these go in\nso we're going to click sort\nand we want the\nmost business friendly at the top\nthen we want moderate then strict then\nnot preferred okay\nso we have our top three that are the\nmost business friendly and then we've\ngot four through ten which are very then\nwe've got our moderate\nour strict\nand are\nnot preferred\nso let's bring region again onto color\nand we can see which regions are the\nmost business friendly\nand we have our year of 2012 there\nand now we're going to make this even\nmore useful by adding the business tax\nrate onto the label\nso that you can see that business\nfriendly\nis like singapore but they have a pretty\nhigh tax rate of 27\nwhereas if you get down to\nsome of these\nthat are not preferred\nsome of them have really low tax rates\nso let's make sure that we're getting\nokay the right tax rate\nso\nyou can see that\n27 is definitely not the highest tax\nrate that we have for business\nbut you can also see that there are\nplaces that have\neven lower tax rates\nlike saudi arabia\nand\nwe have\neight percent here\nit looks like we don't ever go to\nthat second decimal place so let's\nquickly\nformat this\noh\nbusiness tax rate is also text\nso if we could convert\nour data type to\ndecimal and then we will\nformat it\nto be\na percentage\nand we just need the one decimal place\nokay now let's make\nsome annotations so we could come and\nclick here on this mark\nand then we can annotate that mark which\nwill make this dialog box and it's\nalready filled in here\nand so we could use some of this\ninformation so i'm going to copy that\nand i'll put some hard returns there\nso we're going to say\nthat this country\nis the most\nbusiness friendly\nbut has a\nbusiness tax rate\nof and let's grab the tax rate\nand then we'll erase this\ni will hit okay\nand i've made a typo so singapore is the\nmost business friend is not what i meant\nto say\nso i can click edit\nbusiness friendly\nbut has a tax rate of and you can move\nthis around\ndraws the line to singapore which is the\nmark\nthat we wanted to annotate so that is an\nannotation on a mark if we wanted to\njust make an annotation\nfor the area\nthen we could\npoint out that\nmore business friendly\ncountries\noften have\nhigh\nbusiness taxes\nwe can change that size make everything\nfit\nnow we have this\nsecond note\nwhere our user can come in and see some\nmore information about what's being\npresented here\ngreat and now we're going to make one\nmore visualization\nand it's going to be\nabout phone and internet usage\nbecause you may want to know about the\nphone and internet trends\nwhen you're looking to start a business\nso we're going to do this one over time\nso it does not need to have that year\nfilter on it\nand we're doing our continuous our axis\nand we're going to\nlook at mobile phone usage so i double\nclicked it shows mobile phone usage over\ntime\nand we're going to change it to average\nso that it's averaging it across the\ncountries and then we're going to bring\non\ninternet usage so we'll bring it on side\nby side so we have two visualizations\nand we're going to\nalso make that average\nnow we might not want these to share an\naxis because they are measured a little\nbit differently\nand so we can make it a dual axis\nbut allow them to keep their independent\naxes\nor you can synchronize the axes\nand see them at their\nrates however\nthe uses is just a little bit\nof a different measurement we can have\none of them be\na bar chart and the other one be a line\nlet's have this one be the bar chart\nokay and then the line is in the front\nyou can also change which one's in the\nfront by\ncoming and clicking\non the axis itself\nand you can click move marks to front\nand then move that on to the front okay\nand now it's made each of these wide and\nthere's like a star point and end point\non the axis for the bar and that comes\nhere under size\nwhere they're all fixed\nor you could have it be manual where we\ncan define the size of the bar so we're\ngonna make those bars like this\nnow we can see them going up over time\nwe can also change the width of the line\nitself\nmake it thicker or thinner\nand\nwe can change the colors here\nso let's change it to\norange\nsince red might apply that it's bad\nin some cultures\nand now we can see our internet usage\nand our phone usage over time and how\nit's trending\nand so this will all come together on\nour new dashboard\nwhich is about\nease of business\nyou can see that i have a sheet called\nthese as a business and a dashboard that\ni've called ease of business\nbut it won't let you create a dashboard\nwith the same name\nas your worksheet so\nease of business dashboard\nlet's have it fit the screen\nand\nwe're going to bring on our\ndays to start business visual\nour ease of business visual\nand our\nphone and internet visual\nlet's\nput our legends at the top again\nso we'll make\nour horizontal\ncontainer\nand we'll bring our region legend into\nthere and then our\nmeasure names for internet versus\nmobile phone\nand we have a filter that already is\npre-applied to two of the visualizations\ncalled year of year\nand it's selected 2012 and if we select\n2011\nit's only changing this one it's\nfiltering out all the information for\nthis visualization and changing this one\nto\n2011.\nso let's see why that's happening if we\ngo to this\nvisualization and click the go to sheet\nwe can see year of 2012 is here let's\nclick show filter\nand if we change the filter\nto 2011 okay it's not showing up here\nand the only filter i can see that could\nbe removing it is this averages of\nbusiness\nthat is removing anything that is null\nso if i pull that off you can see that\nwe don't seem to have any information\nfor 2011 for ease of business\nand the more years i select i'm not\nseeing any\nease of business information\nso\nwe're going to want to set this\nto 2012 only because that seems to be\nthe only information that is useful for\nthis visualization\nso\nlet's go back until we're back to the\nstate\nwe were in\nwhen we started\nokay so here we are\nnow we're going to want to remove this\nfilter\nand we're going to give it its own\nfilter\nthat only selects 2012\nthat is not connected to the other\nfilter\nso now when we change year of year it\nonly changes this visualization\nsometimes that's useful to note\nsometimes it's useful to put\nlet's do a single value\ndrop down sometimes it's useful to put\nthis\nright next to the visualization it\naffects\nso if we could change it to floating\nand just put it like here\nthat makes it clear that\nit's just changing this chart\nso that people don't get confused\nanother thing that we can do that we\nshould do on all of our visualizations\nis change the titles so that they're\nmore business or user friendly\ngreat\nand\nso we have our filter\nand let's use this as a filter\nand that way we can click on new zealand\nand we can see it's the most business\nfriendly regulations and we can see its\ninternet and phone usage over time\nwe can click on\na lot of different countries to see\nthose changes\nyou can see that\nsome countries have a steeper\nchange so some of them have\nadopted phone and internet usage and\nhave stayed pretty similar whereas other\nones have only really adopted it in the\nlast couple of years\nalso if we wanted to filter to just one\ncountry we could do what we did before\nand create a country filter\nhere's another way to go to the sheet\nyou can click this down arrow and click\ngo to sheet or you can come over here\nyou can see that it's highlighting a\nvisualization over here or a sheet and\nwhatever sheet i click on is highlighted\nover here\nand there's this little pop-out arrow\nhere that also takes you to the sheet\nand we can bring country on\nuse them all\ngo back to our dashboard\nwe'll go to filters and select country\nwe'll make it a multiple value drop down\nwe're going to add the apply button and\nnow we're going to make it apply to all\nthe visualizations by\nclicking apply to workbooks selected\nworksheets all on dashboard okay\nnow we can see that if we just want to\nlook at afghanistan\nokay\nwe can see\nhow many days it takes to start a\nbusiness there it's not preferred for\nbusiness and it's internet and phone\nusage over time\nand those are our\nfour dashboards so as a review we have\nmade a dashboard on population\nwe made one about health\nwe made one that had to do with our\neconomy\nand one that had to do with our ease of\ndoing business\nbusiness intelligence is a set of\nprocesses and techniques to analyze raw\ndata and extract information that helps\ndrive business decisions it helps you\nkeep track of business data and draw\nvaluable insights there are several\ntools that play a key role in business\nintelligence some of the popular tools\nare power bi tableau and clickview hi\nguys welcome to this tutorial on what is\npower bi in this video you will learn\nwhy power bi is needed what is power bi\nthe various features of power bi and the\ndifferent components of power bi later\nyou will look at the architecture of\npower bi what power bi service is and\nhow to create a power bi dashboard\nfinally you will understand a case study\non mire and do a demo using power bi now\nlet's understand why power bi is needed\nfirst power bi has the ability to access\nvast volumes of data from multiple\nsources it allows you to view analyze\nand visualize huge quantities of data\nthat cannot be opened in excel some of\nthe important data sources available in\npower bi are excel csv xml json pdf etc\nsecond power bi provides an easy to use\ndrag and drop tool with features and\nfunctionalities that allow you to copy\nall formatting across similar\nvisualizations power bi has exceptional\nintegration with excel it helps you\ngather analyze publish and share excel\nbusiness data power bi helps to\naccelerate big data preparation with\nazure using power bi with azure allows\nyou to analyze and share vast volumes of\ndata as your data lake can reduce the\ntime it takes to get insights and\nincrease collaboration between business\nanalysts data engineers and data\nscientists power bi allows you to get\ninsights from data and turn insights\ninto actions to take data-driven\nbusiness decisions finally power bi\nallows you to perform real-time stream\nanalytics it fetches data from multiple\nsensors and social media sources to get\naccess to real-time analytics so you are\nalways ready to make business decisions\nnow let's see what power bi is power bi\nis a business analytics service provided\nby microsoft that lets you visualize\nyour data and share insights it converts\ndata from different sources to build\ninteractive dashboards and bi reports as\nyou can see we have an excel data about\nsales\nusing this data power bi helps you build\ndifferent charts and graphs to visualize\nthe data now that we have understood\nwhat power bi is let us look at the\nimportant features of power bi first is\npower via desktop power bi desktop is a\nfree software that you can download and\nit allows you to build reports by\naccessing data easily for using power bi\ndesktop you do not need advanced report\ndesigning or query skills to build a\nreport second as already discussed power\nbi supports stream analytics from\nfactory sensors to social media sources\npower bi assists in real-time analytics\nto make timely decisions third support\nfor multiple data sources is one of the\nmajor features of power bi you can\naccess various sources of data such as\nexcel csv sql server web files etc to\ncreate interactive visualizations and\nfinally custom visualization custom\nvisualization is another vital feature\nof power bi while dealing with complex\ndata power bi's default standard might\nnot be enough in some cases in that case\nyou can access the custom library of\nvisualization that meets your needs\nlet us jump into discussing the various\ncomponents of our bi as you can see\nthere are six major components of power\nbi now let's discuss them one by one\nfirst is power query power query is the\ndata transformation and mass-up engine\nit enables you to discover connect\ncombine and refine data sources to meet\nyour analysis need it can be downloaded\nas an add-in for excel or can be used as\npart of power via desktop second we have\npowerpivot powerpivot is a data modeling\ntechnology that lets you create data\nmodels it also allows you to establish\nrelationships and create calculations it\nuses data analysis expression language\nor dax to model simple and complex data\nthird we have power view power view is a\ntechnology that is available in excel\nsharepoint sql server and power bi it\nlets you create interactive charts\ngraphs maps and other visuals that\nbrings your data to life next we have\npower map microsoft's power map for\nexcel and power bi is a 3d data\nvisualization tool that lets you map\nyour data and plot more than a million\nrows of data visually on bing maps in 3d\nformat from an excel table or data model\nin excel then we have power bi desktop\npower bi desktop is a development tool\nfor power query power pivot and power\nview with power bi desktop you have\neverything under the same solution and\nit is easier to develop bin data\nanalysis experience\nfinally\nwe have power q and a the q and a\nfeature in power bi lets you explore\nyour data in your own words\nit is the fastest way to get an answer\nfrom your data using natural language\nan example could be\nwhat was the total sales last year once\nyou have built your data model and\ndeployed that into power bi website then\nyou can ask questions and get answers\neasily now let's see what power bi\nservice is power bi service is the\nsoftware as a service part of power bi\nit is also referred as power bi online\nto access power bi service you need to\nlog in to app.powerbi.com\nnow let me show you that\ni'll go to google\nopen a new tab and search for app dot\npower bi dot com\nit's loading\nbut this is how the home page of power\nbi service looks like\ni have created some dashboards on it\nfirst you need to log into app.powerbi\nservice\nyou can see i'm logged in\nnow under my workspace if i go to\ndashboard\nhere i've created\na finance dashboard you can see the\ndifferent charts and graphs have\nprepared and pinned it to the dashboard\nso power bi service allows you to\nconnect to your data create reports and\ndashboards and you can also ask\nquestions to your data now as you can\nsee in this dashboard we have created\nsome charts and graphs so this is a tree\nmap there's a pie chart there's a bar\ngraph\nbelow you can see the line charts and\ndonor charts\nit tells you the total sales that were\nmade the total number of units sold the\nsales by product sales by country sales\nby segment and lots more one of the key\nfeatures of power bi is creating\ndashboards from multiple reports and\ndata sets power bi dashboard is a single\npage visualization to tell a story\nthe visualizations on a dashboard are\ngenerated from multiple reports and each\nreport is based on one data set a single\npage dashboard is known as a canvas the\nvisualizations you see on the dashboard\nare called tiles\nthese tiles are pinned to the dashboard\nby report designers now let me go back\nto my dashboard so this is called a\ncanvas\nand each of these are called tiles so on\nthe top you can see we have three tiles\nnow let's understand how to create and\npublish reports in power bi dashboards\npower bi allows you to create different\nreports on power bi desktop these\nreports can be published on the power bi\ndashboard using power bi service here\nyou can see there is a power bi report\ncreated on power via desktop if you\nclick on publish\nit will take you to the power bi service\nwhere you can build a dashboard here is\nthe button for power bi publish\nonce you click on power bi publish it\nwill take you to the dashboard so this\nis a single page power bi dashboard on\npower bi service now let's understand\nthe power bi architecture\npower bi architecture is a service built\non top of azure there are multiple data\nsources that power bi can connect to\npower bi desktop allows you to create\nreports and data visualizations on the\ndata set power bi gateway is connected\nto on-premise data sources to get\ncontinuous data for reporting and\nanalytics power bi services are\nbasically the cloud services that are\nused to publish power bi reports and\ndata visualizations using power bi\nmobile apps you can stay connected to\ntheir data from anywhere power bi apps\nare available for windows ios and\nandroid platforms now let's look at a\ncase study on how mayer which is one of\nunited states largest supermarket chains\nused power bi to solve its business\nproblems initially mayer had become\ndependent on its ikea organization to\nextract insights from its data it was\ntime consuming and inefficient as you\nhad to wait for it to build every report\nmayer was unable to perform ad hoc and\nreal-time analysis easily so what maya\ndid was it connected power bi to an\non-premises sql server analysis services\ncube this allowed them to refresh 20\nbillion rows of data in near real time\nwith power bi teams can now pull in the\ndata faster and perform real-time\nanalysis to derive insights from data a\nbakery department inside mayer used\npower bi to compare its sales with\nregional performance they analyzed where\nmayer was behind the regional trends\nfocused on the problem and created a\nsolution with power bi they can now\ndrill down into hourly sales and send\nout a sales flash to 800 maya business\nleaders so power bi enabled them to\nstandardize data sources and empower\nstore directors and team leaders to\ndevelop and track their data to ensure\nwhat they can improve now let's do some\npractical hands-on demo with power bi so\nthis is how the power bi desktop\ninterface looks like on the left you\nhave the report view the data view and\nthe model view the report view is where\nyou visualize your data with different\ncharts and graphs to build reports the\ndata view allows you to view the whole\ndata while the model view is where you\ncheck if there are any relationship\nbetween the tables\non the right you can see the different\nvisualizations that you can build we'll\nquickly run through all of these in our\ndemo\nso here you can see there's a finance\nsample data that will help you draw\ninsights about the sale of products in\ndifferent countries we will create a\nreport to visualize different charts and\ngraphs and analyze those sales so let me\ngo to my power via desktop first we'll\nimport our data so let me go to our get\ndata tab and choose excel as my data\nsource i click on excel so here is our\nfinance sample data\nwe'll select sheet1 you can see the data\nhere click on it and then select load\nthis might take some time to load the\ndata now if i go to my data tab you can\nsee the entire data set it has fields\nsuch as segment country in which the\nsales was made the name of the product\nthe units sold and the sales price and\nmany more let's start building our\nreport now i'll go to my report view so\nfirst let me create a text box\nlet me resize it\nlet me name it as finance\ndashboard we'll increase the size of the\ntext we'll use font consoles center it\nwe'll also add a background to this use\nblue color change it to white\nand increase the size now let me first\nshow you how you can create a matrix\ni'll go to visualizations and click on\nmatrix let me resize it\nfrom the datasheet tab i'll select sales\nand drag onto values\nso you can see the total number of sales\nthat were made now let me do some\nformatting so i'll go to the format tab\nclick on column headers let's add a\nbackground color and\nlet me increase the text size to\n20. similarly under values we'll\nincrease the size of the text\nto 20 as well\nwe can also click on\nborder and choose the color of the\nborder let me take as\nlet it be black\nso this is a simple matrix that we\ncreated which shows the total number of\nsales that were made similarly let me\nchoose matrix once again now we'll drag\non the units sold onto values\nwe'll continue with the same drill under\ncolumn headers we'll add a background\nthis time let's choose some other color\nand under values let's increase the size\nof the text to 20.\neven for the column headers let's\nincrease the size of the text to 20.\nagain we'll switch on border we resize a\nbit\nso here we have two matrix created for\nour report\nthe first matrix shows us the total\nsales that were made the second matrix\nshows you the total units that were sold\nnow let's move ahead and create a simple\nbar chart so under visualization i click\non clustered column chart\nunder this will drag the date column\nonto access and the sales onto value\nlet me expand it so it shows you the\nsales per year this is the sales that\nwere made in 2013 and this shows you the\nsales that were made in 2014.\nnow there's a drill down option which\ngives you more granularity\nthis depicts the sales by quarter\nif i drill down further you can see this\nshows you the sales by month also you\nhave some options like short buy and\nsort by sales so you can see october\nmonth made the highest number of sales\nmoving ahead let me now create a pie\nchart where we will see the sales by\ndifferent segments\nunder visualization i'll click on pie\nchart let me first resize it\nhere\ni'll drag the segment column onto the\nlegend and the sales column onto the\nvalues as you can see we have the sales\nmade by different segments\ngovernment segment made the highest\nnumber of sales with 44.22\nnow let me add a border to both the\nvisualization i'll click on the pie\nchart and go to the format tab\ni'll switch on the border similarly for\nthe clustered column chart i'll go to\nthe format tab and click on border let\nme resize a bit\nall right next we'll create a very\nsimple table that will depict the total\nsales made by each product so under\nvisualizations i click on table let me\nbring this below\nfrom the data sheet i'll first drag\nproduct onto values\nyou can see the different products and\nthen sales just below it\nso this depicts the total sales that\nwere made by each product and finally it\ndisplays the total value of the sales\nthat were made this is same as the one\nshown here\nnow let's do some formatting under\nformat tab i'll go to values and\nincrease the text size to 15\nand expand it\nalso under column headers i'll increase\nthe text size to 15.\nthen\nlet me go and add a border\nnow let me create a map that will show\nyou the sales that were made by each\ncountry so first let me create a new\npage and under visualization i'll click\non map now i'll drag the country column\nonto location\nso you can see we have our map ready and\nwe'll drag sales\nonto size\nyou can see the different countries and\nthe sales that they made if i move the\nmap you can see the sales made in the\neurope region\nlet me resize it i'll add a border to\nthis\nnow let me go ahead and create a donut\nchart that will show you the profit by\neach segment under visualizations i'll\nclick on donut chart\nand move this to the top now from the\ndata sheet i'll add profit onto the\nvalues\nand\nsegment\nonto the legend\nif i expand this you can see government\nsegment made the highest amount of\nprofit with 65.04 percent let me resize\nthis and we'll add a border\nokay in the final visualization i'll\nshow you how to create a tree map\nthis tree map will tell you the total\namount of sales made by each product so\nunder visualizations i'll click on the\ntree map let me expand it\ni'll drag sales onto values and product\nonto group so here you can see our tree\nmap and the sales made by each product\nyou can see now we have our report ready\nwe have created two separate canvas to\nvisualize our data\nnow\nif you want to change the color of this\nbars then simply go to the format tab\nand under data colors you can choose\nwhichever color you want in power bi\ndesktop you have an option to switch\nyour theme\nthis will make your dashboard or the\nreport look more attractive so now we\nare under the default mode let's try out\ndifferent themes\nthat's frontier\ntemperature\nsolar which is a little yellowish the\none which i like is tidal\ni hope this was helpful in making you\nunderstand the basics of power bi and\nhow it works you learned the various\nfeatures and the components of power bi\nand looked at the architecture of power\nbi finally you saw a demo to create a\nreport using finance data set in our\nprevious video on what is power bi we\nhad learnt the basics of power bi its\nfeatures and components the architecture\nof power bi followed by a demo in this\nvideo we will learn what power bi\ndashboard is we'll understand how to\ncreate different reports in power bi\ndesktop then you will publish a\ndashboard onto power bi service and\nfinally you will derive insights from\nthe dashboard\nnow let's understand what power bi\ndashboard is power bi dashboard is a\nsingle page visualization to tell a\nstory here on the screen you can see\nthere's a dashboard which has been\npublished on power bi service there are\nmultiple charts and graphs that you can\nsee the visualizations on a dashboard\nare generated from reports and each\nreport is based on one data set a single\npage dashboard is known as a canvas the\nvisualizations you see on the dashboard\nare called tiles and each of these tiles\nare pinned to the dashboard by report\ndesigners today we'll be covering the\nfollowing dashboard that you see on the\nscreen it will be a three page report\nwhere we will be analyzing the super\nstore sample data as you can see there\nare three tabs now let me move over to\nour data set so our super store sample\ndata set is in the form of an excel file\nyou can see there are multiple columns\nyou can see there's order date shipment\ndate the mode of shipment customers\nfirst name and last name the segment to\nwhich the customer belong to country of\nthe customer the city state and if you\ngo towards the end you can see that the\ndifferent product names the sales\nquantity sold discount and the profit so\nthe report that you see here and the one\nwhich we are going to create might vary\na little in terms of the color\nformatting and the spacing so you need\nnot worry about that now let me go ahead\nand bring up a new workspace so i'll go\nto file click on new this will take some\ntime to bring up our new workspace\nnow it will ask you for trying the free\nversion or if you want you can go ahead\nand sign in i'll just close this so here\nis our new workspace before creating the\ndashboard we need to make some changes\nto our superstore data set using the\nfeatures of power bi desktop first we'll\nextract the year month and quarter\nvalues from the order date column i'll\ngo to getdata tab click on excel as my\nsource i locate my file it's on desktop\nclick on open this might take some time\nto load the data set i'll select the\norders sheet you can see the preview of\nour data here i'll go ahead and click on\nload this will take some time to load\nthe data set onto power bi desktop i\nthink we have successfully loaded our\ndata set you can check that by going to\nthe data tab so here is our data set\nfirst let's make some changes in the\nformat of the order date and the\nshipment date i'll click on the order\ndate under the modeling tab\nwe have this data type and the format\ni'll click on the drill down option\nunder date and time now let's choose the\nfirst one which is in the format of ddm\nyyyy\ni'll click on it\nas you can see our order date column has\nbeen changed to that particular format\nsimilarly i'll select the ship date\ncolumn\ngo to the format option under date and\ntime i'll click on the first one\nhere you can see even the ship date\ncolumn has been changed to that\nparticular format now let's extract the\nmonth values from the order date column\nto do that right click on the order date\ncolumn\nselect new column\nso this will create a new column if you\ngo to the end\nso there's a new column\nrename this column as month and since we\nwant the month value from the ordered\ndate column i'll search for order date\ndot since i want the month i'll select\nmonth\nif i hit enter\nit will give me the month values from\nthe order date column\nsimilarly if you want to get the quarter\nvalues from the order date\nright click select new column\nrename the column as quarter\nthen choose the order date column\nfollowed by the quarter\nname hit enter\nso you can see you have a quarter column\nand it has all the values of the quarter\nto which the date belongs to now let me\ngo ahead and create one more column\nthis time we'll create a new column for\nthe order year this time we'll extract\nthe order year values so let me rename\nit as year we'll continue with the same\nprocedure i'll look for the order date\nand then select the year\nhit enter\nso it gives you only the year values on\nwhich the order was placed\nnow let's find which day of the week was\nthe order placed so we need to use the\nweekday function and give the order date\nas parameter followed by which day you\nwant the week to start with i'll show\nyou how to do that so i'll click on\norder date\nthen\nselect new column\nlet's rename this column as\nday of week\ni'll use the weekday function of power\nbi can hit tab to finish i look for my\norder date column\ncomma\ni'll choose 2 here since i want my week\nto start with monday and end on a sunday\nhit enter\nso you can see we have the day of the\nweek column\nso the idea to create this day of week\ncolumn is to find out if the order was\nplaced on a weekday or a weekend now let\nme go ahead and create one more new\ncolumn\nlet's\nname this column as\nwe day\nor a weekend\ni'll use an if clause\nand pass in my parameters for logical\ntest i'll use the day of the week column\nso i'll search for orders\nand then look for day of week if this\nday of the week is equal to 6 which\nmeans if it's a saturday or i'm using\nthe or operator\nif the day of week is a sunday that is\nseven\nthen\nit's a weekend\nelse it's a big day\nand close the bracket\nhit enter so you can see we have our big\nday and weekend column so moving ahead\nanother thing we can do is we can find\nthe total number of days it took for the\nshipment of the product this can be done\nusing the directive function of power bi\nso let me show you how you can do that\ni'll click on any column right click go\nto new column let's rename the column as\ndays\nfor\nshipment then i'll use the datedif\nfunction\ni'll give my starting date which is the\norder date so i'll search for\norder date\nfollowed by the second date will be our\nshipment date which is ship date and the\nday\ni'll hit enter\nso you can see here it gives us the\ntotal number of days it took for the\nshipment of the product now let's create\na full name column where we will\nconcatenate the first name and the last\nname of the customer let me go ahead and\ndo that\ni'll create a new column\nlet me rename the column as\nfull name\nthen i'll take the first name\nfrom the orders table\nuse the amber send\nfollowed by a space using inverted\ncommas followed by another ampersand and\nthe last name\ni hit enter\nyou can see we have a full name column\nif you go back so there were two columns\nin the name of first name and last name\nnow we have merged both the columns into\na single column named full name and you\ncan see the first name space and the\nlast name now let me give the sales\ncolumn\na currency value so i'll select the\nsales column\nhere\nunder general\nif i go to currency i can see there are\nmultiple currency symbols\nchoose whatever you want for this video\ni'll take dollar english united states\nyou can see our sales column is now\nrepresented by a dollar value similarly\nlet me make some changes to the profit\ncolumn as you can see there are multiple\ndecimal values for each profit so let's\nstandardize it\nso i'll select the profit column\nand this is where you can standardize it\nnow it's auto so let me\nmake it two decimal places\nso our data is ready now let's go to the\nreport view and start building our\nreports\nbefore that\nunder the model view\nyou can see the new columns that we had\ncreated you can see there's weekday\nweekend this year\nthis quarter column month column\nthe same\nyou can see under the report view as\nwell\nunder fields\nyou can see these are the columns that\nwe created days of shipment day of week\nquarter\nmonth weekday or weekend and year now we\nare under the report view first let me\ngo ahead and create a text box\nso under the home tab you have the text\nbox\ni'll select that\nlet me stretch it a bit\nwe'll give a title\nsales\ndashboard i'll select this and increase\nthe size to\nlet's say 28 we make it bold\nand\ncenter align it also\nunder the visualizations tab under\nbackground\nwe'll add a background color to this\ntext box let me select this blue color\nand let me make\nthe font\nas white\nso now we have our title ready\nso under general you can decrease the\nheight of the text box let me make it as\n70.\nfirst let us create a new card from the\nvisualizations panel so under\nvisualizations there is an option to\ncreate new card i'll click on it\nlet me resize\ni'll move it to the top\nwe'll see the total amount of sales or\nthe total revenue that was generated\nfrom the sales\nafter selecting the card i'll choose\nsales onto fields\nso here you can see it gives you the\ntotal sales that were made so which is\nnearly 2.3 million dollars\nif i go to the format tab under data\nlabel\nlet me switch on the border\nunder title\nyou can give a new title for example\ntotal\nrevenue hit enter\nnow you can\nincrease the text size to say 15\nand center line it\nyou can also change the color of the\nsales value so under data label\nunder colors you can choose whichever\ncolor you want\nsimilarly let's create one more card to\nfind the total number of units that were\nsold i'll copy the same card\nctrl c ctrl v\ni'll move it a little below\nnow i'll remove the sales column\nfrom the fields and add\nthe quantity column\nonto fields\nagain\nunder title i'll edit this title as\ntotal\nquantity sold\nlet me create one more card\nwhere we will see the total amount of\nprofit that were made\ni'll select this\ni'll remove the quantity column\nand add profit\nunder the format tab\nunder title\ni'll make this as\ntotal\nprofit\nhit enter\nstretch it a bit so that you can see the\ntotal amount of profit that were made\nnow\nlet me add a slicer\nwherein\nwe'll have the order date column\nso i'll add the order date column onto\nfields\nso you can see here we have the order\ndate column\nand\nunder slicer header\nlet me increase the text size\nto 15\nand\nlet's switch on the border\nyou can also give a title to the slicer\nso under the format tab\ngo to title\nswitch it on\nand we'll give a title text as\nslicer\nby\norder\ndate\nscroll down\ni'll center align it and\nincrease the text size to 15.\nnow if you want\nyou can also change the date colors\nto blue so under date inputs then go to\nfont color and select any blue color\nnow let's create a line and stack column\nchart to visualize sales and profit by\neach year each month and each quarter so\nfrom the visualizations tab let me\nselect line and stack column chart\ni'll resize this\nafter that let me add the order date\ncolumn onto the shared axis\nwe'll drag the sales onto column values\nand under line values i'll take the\nprofit column\nso here you can see we have the sales\nand profit by each year\nthe bars represent the sales and this\nline represents the profit it made for\neach year\nlet me go to the format tab\nand\nmake some changes to the data colors let\nthe color of the profit remain the same\nbut the bars i'll choose a custom color\ngive a hexadecimal value like\n196273\nhit enter\nso we have successfully changed the\ncolor of the bars\npower bi has an interesting feature\nwhere you can drill down the sales by\neach year each month each quarter or by\ndays so let me show you so on the top it\nshows you go to the next level in the\nhierarchy so if i click on this\nhere you can see the sales and the\nprofit that were made for each quarter\nin every year\nquarter four for every year with the\nhighest amount of sales and the profit\nsimilarly if i drill down further you\ncan see let me expand it you can see by\nmonth\nthis is\nfor each month\nover all the years how much sales were\nmade\nyou can check\nnovember month gave us the highest\namount of sales and\ndecember month gave us the highest\namount of profit\nsimilarly you can still go to the next\nhierarchy here you can see\nthe sales and the profit made for each\nday\nover all the years so day 17 made the\nhighest amount of sales\nand day 23 gave us the highest amount of\nprofit if you see the lowest sales and\nthe profit you can see order date 25\ngave us the lowest amount of profit\nand similarly you can see day 29 gave us\nthe lowest amount of sales\nnow you can also go to the format tab\nand switch on the data labels\nso you can see here\nin 2014\nwe got nearly 49.5 k profit and nearly\n0.48 million dollar sales similarly in\n2015 we had nearly 61.6 k profit and\n0.47 million sales and so on\nnow let me go ahead to the format tab\nand\nswitch on the border let me now create a\nclustered column chart for sales by year\nand quarter so from the visualizations\nlet's select clustered column chart let\nme resize this a bit\nand\nunder access\nwe'll add the year column\nso i'll drag here on to access under\nlegend i'll take\nthe quarter column\nand under values i'll choose sales\nso you can see here the sales that were\nmade under each quarter for each year\nthis picture clearly says quarter four\nfor every year made the highest amount\nof sales and quarter one\nmade the lowest\nlet me go to the format tab\nand\ni'll go to the data colors let's change\nthe colors for each of these quarters\nwe'll be using hexadecimal values so\nunder custom colors for quarter one\nlet me select hexadecimal value as\nfollows\nfor example pf\nd6\nd9\nsimilarly for quarter 2\ni'll select\n6d\nline basics\nfor quarter three\nand finally for quarter four\ni choose a little darker color\nso here is how our clustered column\nchart looks like and we can see the\nsales by year and quarter\nnow let me go ahead and\nlet's add a border\nnow\nwe'll analyze the seals by each state so\nfor that\nwe'll use field map so i'll click on\nfield map\nlet me resize it\nnow let me add the state column onto\nlocation\nand the tool tips i'll\nadd the sales column\nlet me expand it so you can see here we\nhave the map which shows the sales by\neach state\nnow let's do some color formatting to\nthis\ni'll go to the format tab\nclick on add colors\nand blue is the default color there is\nan additional option\nwhere you can use conditional formatting\nso i'll use that\nso it gives you the option to choose\nyour color between maximum value and the\nminimum value you can also choose this\ndiverging option where you get a center\nvalue or a mid value as well now for the\nminimum value\ni'll choose a color again i'll use a\ncustom color\nit will be similar to a green color\ni'll hit ok\nthen\nlet's use\nsome orange color for the mid value\nrange for example\neb\nand similarly for the maximum value\nwe'll use a little darker color which\nlooks similar to red\nclick enter so now we have defined our\ncolor scheme\nlet's click on ok\nlet's zoom out so you can see the states\nwhich are in green color made the lowest\namount of sales\nwhile those which are in orange or in\nred made the highest amount of sales so\nin this example you can see california\nhad the highest amount of sales\nsimilarly new york is next it's just\nbelow california with the amount of\nsales followed by texas we'll go back\nlet me\nalso\nadd a border to this\nsimilarly\nyou can also select the profit column or\nthe unit sold column to see the units or\nthe profit that were sold by each state\nso let me now go ahead and create a\ndonor chart in that donor chart we'll\nanalyze the sales and profit by each\nsegment\nso under visualizations i click on donut\nchart\nso under legend\ni'll add the segment column\nunder values i'll take the sales column\nand\nwe also want the profit so i'll take\nthe profit column on to tooltips\nso you can see we have our donor chart\nprepared and you can see the sales and\nprofit by each segment\nlet me expand this the donut chart\nindicates consumer segment made the\nhighest amount of sales and profit\nwhile home office segment made the\nlowest\ni'll go back\nlet me go to the format tab\nand we'll make some formatting to our\ndata\nlet's change the color of all the\nsegments\nchoose custom color\nlet's give our color\ncoding as\n1558c\nsimilarly we'll change\nthe color for corporate segment as well\nlet's take a gray color\nand finally we'll change the color for\nhome office as well\ni'll also switch on the border\nso we have our donut chart prepared now\nlet's move ahead and create a pie chart\nto analyze the profit and sales by each\ncategory of products so under\nvisualizations i'll select pie chart\ni'll drag the category column on to\nlegend\nunder values i'll take the profit column\nand under tool tips i'll take the sales\ncolumn\nso you can see we have a simple pie\nchart that tells you the profit and the\nsales that were made by each category\nas it's evident category technology made\nthe highest amount of sales and profit\nwhile furniture category made the lowest\namount of profit and sales\ni'll go\nback under format\ni'll change the data colors\nlet's go ahead and do that\ni'll use custom colors and give\nhexadecimal color value\nsimilarly for office supplies\ni'll take another hexadecimal value\nand finally we'll change the color of\nthe furniture category\nalso\nlet's give a border\nso we have a pie chart prepared that\ntells you the profit and sales by each\ncategory of products\nnow we are done with our first sales\ndashboard so i can go ahead\nand rename\nthis tab as\noverall\nsales\nnext\nwe are going to analyze the sales profit\nquantity sold and all of these\nby taking region and the state as\nfilters so we'll continue with the same\ndrill first i'll create a text box\nso under home menu i'll go to text box\ni'll stretch this\ni'll give a title to this page for\nexample\nregion and\nstate\nlevel analysis\nlet me make it bold\nand\ni'll increase the size to 28\nmake it center aligned\nwe'll make the text\nas white\nand\nunder visualizations\nlet's give a background color\ni'll choose this blue color\nso let me go ahead and create three\nslicers a region slicer a state slicer\nand a ear slicer\nso under visualizations i'll click on\nslicer\nlet me resize\nmove it on top\nand\nfor region slicer i need to add region\nonto fields\nso you can see we have a region filter\nnow\nlet's do some formatting to this\nunder slicer header\nlet me make the font color\nwhite\nand\nlet's give a background\nlet's say blue\nand let me increase the text size to\nsay 15\nyou can also choose a font family\nlet's go for calibri\nand\nyou can increase the size\nof the items\nlet's increase the text size\nto\nsay 15\nand\nlet's give a border\nso now you have the region slicer ready\nlet me copy paste this\nnext\nwe'll create the state slicer so i'll\nremove region from here and add\nstate onto the field\nso you can see we have the state slicer\nready similarly\nyou can also go ahead\nand create\na year slicer\nwhere you can analyze the sales and\nprofit or quantity by year\ni'll remove state from here\nand\ni'll drag the year column on to field\nyou can see we have all the four years\nfrom 2014 to 2017. now sometimes it\nmight be difficult for you to scroll\nthrough all the values present in a\nslicer for example\nin the state slicer\nyou can see there are multiple states\nand if you want to filter your report by\na particular state\nyou have to always scroll down or scroll\nup and check manually where the state is\nso power bi gives you this feature where\nyou can use the search option\nso if i click on this\nyou can see there's a search option\nselect that so now\nin the search bar you can search for any\nstate you are looking for for example if\nyou want to search for california state\nyou can just type on california so i\nhave just typed cal and it shows me\ncalifornia that's an important feature\nthat power bi gives you\nso let me now go ahead and create a\nsimple table where we will see the\nquantity and the profit made in each\ncity so under visualizations i'll select\ntables\nlet me resize this\nso under values first i'll add the city\ncolumn\nfollowed\nby the quantity column\nand\nthe profit column\nlet's do some formatting\nso under column headers\nlet me change the font color to white\nand let's add a background\nlet me increase the text size also\nlet's make it 15.\nsimilarly if you scroll down under\nvalues\nlet's increase the text size\nto 15 as well\nand\nlet's choose the font family\nlet's take consoles\nso here\nyou can see all the cities\nthe quantity\nsold in each city and the profit that\nwas made in each of these cities\nnow let me add a border to this\nso now you can filter each of the cities\nby region or by state\nfor example if i choose central\nas my region\nit will give you all the cities that lie\nin the central region\nsimilarly\nyou can also search for any state for\nexample\ni am taking minnesota\nso under minnesota you can see all the\ncities\nand the quantity as well as the profit\nmade\nlet me now uncheck the filters\nnow let me go ahead and filter this\ntable\nin terms of profit so i'll sort by\nprofit\nyou can see\nwe have our cities\nsorted in terms of profit\nso new york city made the highest amount\nof profit followed by los angeles and\nseattle below you can see the total\nunits that were sold and the total\nprofit that was made from all the cities\nso you can also filter down the quantity\nsold and the profit made by each year as\nwell as by region and state\nso let's see\nsuppose i am choosing\neast as the region\nso under east it tells you the states\nthat are present\nlet's\ngo for delaware\nand let's select 2016 as my year\nso you can see\nthe cities\nthat lie under delaware state\nand the quantity as well as the profit\nthey made in 2016. similarly let's\nselect\nmassachusetts as the state and let's\ngo for another year for example 2017.\nyou can see\nall the cities that are present under\nmassachusetts the quantity sold and the\nprofit that was made below you can see\nthe total quantity and the profit\nlet me uncheck all these\nnow moving ahead\nlet's analyze the sales by each state\nand the category of product for this\nwe'll create a clustered bar chart so\nunder visualizations i'll select\nclustered bar chart let me resize a bit\nunder access\ni'll take the state column\ni'll take category on to legend\nand under values\ni'll put the sales column\nso you can see here\nwe have the sales for each category\nunder each state\nfor example california state made the\nhighest amount of sales under technology\ncategory and it made the lowest amount\nof sales under office supplies\nif i scroll down you can see all the\nstates\nand the sales they made\nfor each category\ni'll go back to the report\nnow let's use some filters\nyou can filter here for example if i\nwant to check\nthe sales by each state and category for\n2015 i can just\nclick on\n2015 and it will tell you the sales that\nwere made\nnow\nlet's do some formatting to this bar\nchart\nwe'll change the colors for each of the\ncategories\nsimilarly we change the color for office\nsupplies\nand finally for the technology\nso now we have our bar chart ready\nmoving on now let me add a border to\nthis bar chart\nokay\nso now that we have seen our sales by\nstate and category let's now check the\nprofit by year and category for that\nwe'll create an area chart\nand resize this chart\nnow\nunder axis\ni'll take the year column\nunder legend\ni'll take the category column\nand\nunder values\ni'll take profit\nso we have an area chart that depicts\nthe profit by each year and the category\nto which the product belong to\ngo to the format tab\nand under data colors\ni'll choose some colors\nlet's change furniture to this blue\ncolor\ni'll take office\na red color\nand technology i'll is a green color\nso now you can use the filters\nfor example you can check the profit\nthat was made by each year and category\nunder east region\nso you can see here\nin 2017 technology made the highest\namount of profit while furniture\nat the lowest\nsimilarly\nlet's\ncheck for\nsouth region\nso you can see in south region in 2016\ntechnology made the highest amount of\nprofit and\nfurniture made the lowest in 2017\noffice supplies made the highest amount\nof profit and furniture was the lowest\ni'll uncheck this south region filter\nsimilarly you can also see the sales by\neach state so under state slicer you can\nchoose whichever state you want and\ncheck the profit it made by that year or\ncategory\nfor example i'll choose connecticut\nso you can see the profit connecticut\nstate made in each of these years\ni'll uncheck it\nlet us move ahead and now let's see\nprofit that was made and the quantity\nthat was sold by each category and\nsubcategory of the product so for this\ni'll choose the line and cluster column\nchart so\ni'll select from the visualizations now\nunder shared access\ni'll select the category column under\ncolumn series i'll take the sub category\ncolumn\nunder column values\ni'll choose profit\nand\ni'll choose quantity\nunder the tooltips\nso now you can see\nthe profit that was made under each\ncategory and the sub category\nfor technology category copiers\nsub-category made the highest amount of\nprofit the quantity sold was 234.\nsimilarly\nif you check for furniture category\nwe didn't make any profit for table\nsubcategory\nand as well as for bookcases\nunder office supplies paper sub category\nmade the highest amount of profit\nnow let me go ahead and add a border to\nthis\nfine\nmoving ahead now we will see the seals\nby each segment for that\nlet's create a funnel so from\nvisualizations i'll take the\nfunnel\nand\ni'll drag\nsegment onto group\nand the sales column onto values\nso you can see here the sales that were\nmade by each segment\nthis picture clearly depicts that\nconsumer segment made the highest amount\nof sales\nnext was corporate and then home office\nnow\nlet's do some color formatting so the\ndefault color is this blue\ni'll click on so all\nnow we'll give individual colors to each\nof the segments\nusing custom color\nlet's give a hexadecimal value\nsimilarly we'll change the color for the\ncorporate segment\nand finally for the home office segment\nnow let me go ahead and give a border to\nit\nso if you want to analyze the sales\nby segment and for a particular region\nor state or any particular year you can\ndo that so let's select\nfor east region\nand\nlet's take\nnew jersey as the state\nfor year 2014 suppose\nso you can see here\ncorporate segment made the highest\namount of sales followed by consumer and\nhome office\nlet me uncheck\nthese filters\nso our second report is ready where we\nanalyzed the sales quantity profit at\nregion level state level and by year so\ni can rename this\nas\nregion and state\nnext we will analyze the sales quantity\nprofit\nin terms of categories and subcategory\nof products so let me first copy this\ntext box\nand\ncreate a new tab\ni'll paste that text box here and\nchange the title to\nsay\ncategory\nand\nsub category level analysis\nfirst\nwe'll create a\nslicer\nwhere we'll take\nthe category as filter\nso\nif i want i can directly copy it from my\nprevious tab\nand change the fields so let me copy\nthis\nand paste it here\ni'll sync it\nand let me remove the region field and\nadd\ncategory onto the field\nso you can see\nwe have the three categories here\nlet me copy paste this again\nand\nlet me take\nthe sub category now\nso i'll select this\nand\ni'll drag sub category onto the field so\nhere you can see we have all the sub\ncategories and above we have the\ncategories\nlet me resize this a bit\nwith that now let's analyze the sales\nand profit by region and segment\nto do this we'll use a tree map so let's\nsee how you can build a tree map under\nvisualizations i have tree map let me\nselect it\ni'll move it to the top\nand expand it a bit\nnow\nunder group\ni'll select\nregion column\nunder details i'll take\nsegment\ni'll take the sales column under values\nand\nlet's take profit\non two tooltips\nso if i expand this\nyou can see the sales and profit by each\nregion and segment for example in the\nwest region you have\nconsumer corporate and home office\nas the segments and you can see\nconsumer segment made the highest amount\nof sales and profit\nwhile home office made the lowest amount\nof sales and profit\nsimilarly you can check for the other\nregions as well\nnow\nlet's give a border to this tree map and\nunder data colors let me change the\ncolor of the regions\nscroll down\ncustom color\nlet me choose my own color\nlet's take this as a gray color\nand finally\nfor the west region\nso now you can select individual\ncategories and sub categories to check\nthe sales and profit by region and\nsegment for example\nif i select\nfurniture as my category\nyou can see the changes that were made\nto the tree map\nyou can also select office supplies and\nsee\nhow the sales and profit changes\nsimilarly you can also go ahead\nand select whatever sub categories you\nwant\nand then check the sales and profit by\nregion and segment with that let me now\ncreate a pie chart\nto see the quantity and the sales by\neach segment\nso i'll go and select a pie chart\nlet me resize this\nif you want you can increase the size of\nthis tree map\nalso so let me go ahead\nand select segment onto the legend\nunder values i'll take\nquantity\nand\nsales under tooltips\nso this pie chart\ndepicts the quantity and the sales that\nwere made by each segment\nas you can see consumer segment made the\nhighest amount of sales and had the\nhighest quantity sold\nwhile home office had the least number\nof quantity sold and the least number of\nsales\nlet's add a border\nand\nchange the data colors\nsimilarly i change the color for the\ncorporate segment let's make this\ngray\nand home office\ni'll take the following color\nmove this a little to the right\nnow\nlet's build a scatter plot to analyze\nthe sales quantity and profit by each\nsub category so under visualizations\ni'll select scatter plot i'll resize\nthis\nso i'll add\nsubcategory\nonto legend\nthen i'll add sales onto the x axis\nquantity sold onto the y-axis\nand under size\nwill take the profit\ncolumn if i expand this\nyou can see the sales quantity and the\nprofit that was made for each sub\ncategory of products you can see here\nsub category phone has given us a\nsignificant amount of sales with less\nnumber of quantities sold and it has\ngiven us a good amount of profit also\nsimilarly sub category chairs has also\ngiven us good amount of sales with close\nto 2356 quantities sold and a good\namount of profit if you see this one\nwhich is sub category paper it gave us\nless amount of sales with more\nquantities sold while it gave us good\namount of profit though so you may\npromote phones or for example chairs to\nsell more since it gives you more amount\nof profit with less quantity sold\nlet's add a border to this\nyou can use the category filter suppose\nif i choose for furniture\nand expand this\nyou can see\nunder furniture sub category furnacings\ngave us the lowest amount of sales with\nthe highest number of quantities sold\nbut it gave us a decent amount of profit\nsub-category tables gave us a decent\namount of sales with lesser number of\nquantities sold but didn't give us any\nprofit\nsub-category chairs gave us the highest\namount of sales and also the profit\ni'll uncheck this\nlet's now create a line chart where we\ncan see the profit by each year and\nquarter\nso under visualizations\ni'll select line chart\nme resize this\nso under access\ni'll take here\nunder legend\ni'll take the quarter column and under\nvalues\ni'll take the profit column\nso now you can see\nthe profit that was made\neach year\nand\nthe lines depict each\nquarter so if you check for 2014\nquarter four made the highest amount of\nprofit while quarter two made the lowest\namount of profit while quarter one made\nthe lowest amount of profit similarly if\nyou see for 2016 you can see\nquarter four made the highest amount of\nprofit\nwhile quarter one meet the lowest\nif you check for 2017 you see quarter\nthree and quarter four almost made the\nsame amount of profit while\nquarter two made the lowest amount of\nprofit\ni go back\nnow you can filter these by categories\nalso suppose if i see for\ntechnology you can check the amount of\nprofit that was made in each year and in\neach quarter for technology category\nlet's add a border to this\nlikewise we'll now create another line\nchart that will depict the sales by each\nyear and quarter\nso\nlet me copy paste this\ni'll drag this to the right\nnow i'll remove\nprofit from values and add sales\nlet me uncheck this also\nso here you can see we have the sales by\neach year and quarter\nnow if you see for 2014 again quarter\nfour made the highest amount of sales\nand quarter 1 in 2014 made the lowest\nyou see for 2016 you can see 2016 also\nquarter four made the highest amount of\nsales and quarter one made the lowest\ngo back\nso our final report is ready where we\nanalyzed the sales quantity sold the\nprofit at category and sub category\nlevel\ni can go ahead and rename this as\ncategory\nand\nsubcategory\nlet me save this now if you want\nyou can also filter it by sub categories\nfor example if i select\nchairs as my subcategory\nso for chairs you can see the sales that\nwas made by each year and quarter\nso in 2017 quarter four made the highest\namount of sales\nwhile quarter one made the lowest amount\nof sales for chairs\nsimilarly\nyou can select other sub categories also\nfor example\nlet me take\nsome other category like\nmachines\nlet's see the profit now\nso for machine sub category you can see\nin 2014 quarter 4 made the highest\namount of profit while\nquarter 3\nmade the lowest amount of profit\nnow if you check for 2015 you can see\nquarter three made the highest amount of\nprofit in chairs while quarter one made\nthe lowest amount of profit\nlet's uncheck this\nso now we are almost done building our\nreport using the superstore sample data\nset\nso we have our three reports ready you\ncan see the first one was overall sales\nthe second report we created\nby taking region state and the year as\nfilters so we had a region and state\nlevel analysis and finally we analyzed\nthe sales quantity and the profit sold\nby category and subcategory so i have\narranged all these graphs and charts so\nthat it looks little better now\nlet me go to this publish option on the\ntop so that we can publish this report\nonto the power bi dashboard\nso i'll click on publish\ni'll save it\nyou can select the destination here i\nhave only one destination which is my\nworkspace so i'll choose it\nand select\nso there you go\npublishing to power bi it was successful\ni'll close it\nand let me move to my power bi service\ni'll refresh it for once\nso under\nmy workspace\nyou can see\nwe have the dashboard report\nso below you can see there are three\ntabs that we created the first one is\noverall sales\nthe second one is sales by region the\nthird one is by category and sub\ncategory\nnow\nto put this reports onto the dashboard i\nneed to pin each one of these\nvisualizations\nso\nlet me pin one by one\nso it asks where would you want to pin\nit to i'll select the existing dashboard\nor better let's create a new dashboard\nlet's say\npower bi\ndashboard\nspin it\ni'll close this\nsimilarly let's spin the remaining ones\ni'll select power bi dashboard again pin\nit\nlet's spin everything\nso this slicer you can't pin it\nlet's do the remaining ones\nsame will do for\nthe donut chart\nas well as\nfor the pie chart\nnow\nnow if i go to\nmy dashboards\nand select power bi dashboard\nyou can see\nwe have a one page\ndashboard\nhere\nyou can resize\nall the charts and graphs\nlet me resize it\nand move it to the top\nso we have our first canvas here\nwhich tells you the overall sales the\nprofit and the units that were sold over\ndifferent states different segments\nand by categories\nso one of the important feature that\npower bi service gives you is that you\ncan ask questions about your data and it\nwill tell you what the exact solution is\nfor example you can see here you have a\nfield where you can ask questions so for\nexample if i type\ntotal\nsales and hit enter\nso it tells you the total amount of\nsales that were made which is 2.3\nmillion dollars similarly if i want to\nfind out the total\nprofit i can search for it here\nhit enter it will give you the exact\namount of profit that was made let's do\nsomething else for example if you want\ntotal\nprofit\nby\nsay here\nand hit enter it gives you a nice line\nchart where you can see the total profit\nthat was made over all the four years\nnext\nsuppose i search for total\nquantity\nsold\nby\nsegment\nsee it gives me a bar chart where you\ncan see the total quantity that was sold\nand\nit gives you a list of options where you\ncan find out the total quantity that was\nsold by\ncity state order id first name last name\nand many others so consumer segment had\nthe highest quantity sold\nlet's see for something else for example\nif you want\nthe total\nsales\nby\nsay subcategory\ni'll choose the first one see you have\nall the subcategories and the total\nsales that they made so it's a very\ninteresting feature that power bi gives\nyou\ngo back\nnow if you want\nyou can go to the report menu and if you\nwant you can pin the other\nvisualizations as well\nso another important feature about power\nbi dashboard is that you can derive\ninsights from the visualization for\nexample\nif i click on these dots and there's an\noption you find view insights\ni'll select it\nso on the right you can see power bi has\nitself given us some insights from the\ndata and the visualizations we have made\ncan see sales per year and quarter\nthe sales by day of week and quarter\nsales by shipment mode where you can see\nthe standard class sip mode made the\nhighest amount of sales\nyou can also see the sales and count of\ncity by year\nand many more\nin this video we'll be creating two\ndashboards using a sample sales data set\nso if you want to get the data and the\ndashboard file that we'll be creating in\nthis demo then please put your email ids\nin the comments section of the video our\nteam will share the files via email now\nlet's begin by understanding what is a\ndashboard in excel\na dashboard is a visual interface that\nprovides an overview of key measures\nrelevant to a particular objective with\nthe help of charts and graphs\ndashboard reports allow managers to get\na high level overview of the business\nand help them make quick decisions\nthere are different types of dashboards\nsuch as strategic dashboards analytical\ndashboards and operational dashboards\nan advantage of dashboards is the quick\ndetection of outliers and correlations\nwith comprehensive data visualization it\nis time saving as compared to running\nmultiple reports\nwith this understanding\nlet's jump into our demo\nfor creating our dashboards we'll be\nusing a sample sales data set\nlet me show you the data set first\nso here is the sales data set that we'll\nbe using for our demo\nso this data set was actually generated\nusing a simulator and is completely\nrandom\nit was not validated though we have\napplied certain transformations to the\ndata using power query features\nso this data as you can see has\n1000 rows so using the simulator we had\ngenerated thousand rows of data\nsimilarly\nif i go on top you can see\nthis data set has\n17 columns\nnow let me give you a brief about each\nof the columns so first we have the\nregion column so we have middle east and\nnorth africa this north america\nasia\nsub-saharan africa and others\nsimilarly we have the country names from\nwhich the item was ordered\nthe third column is the item type so we\nhave different items cosmetics\nvegetables there's baby food cereal\nfruits\netc then we have the representatives\nname or you can see this as the customer\nname who ordered the product\nthen we have a sales channel column so\nthere are basically two channels\nwhether the item was sold offline or\nonline\nnext we have the order priority column\nnow here c stands for critical\nthen we have h which is for high\npriority orders then we have m for\nmedium priority orders and finally we\nhave l which is for low priority orders\nyou can see the order date column\nthen we have the order id the ship date\nnext we have\nunits sold\nwhich is basically the total number of\nunits sold for each item\nthen we have the unit price column this\nis the price at which\neach product was sold\nthen we have the unit cost column which\nis basically the production cost for\neach of the items next we have the total\nrevenue the total revenue is actually\nthe product of units sold and unit price\nthen we have the total cost column\nnow the total cost column is actually\nthe product of units sold and the unit\ncost\nsimilarly we have the total profit\ncolumn so total profit is the difference\nbetween total revenue and the total cost\nand finally\nwe have created two more columns that is\norder year and then we have\norder month now these two columns were\nactually generated using the power query\nfeatures\nso we use the order date column which is\nthis column and extracted order year and\norder month\nso first we are going to create a\nrevenue dashboard where we'll focus on\ngenerating reports for revenue by order\nyear revenue by year and region revenue\nby order priority and much more\nwe'll create separate pivot tables and\npo charts and format them to make them\nlook more interesting and presentable\nwe'll add slices and timeline to our\ndashboards in order to filter it based\non specific fields\nnow let's create our first report to see\nthe total revenue generated each year\nso we need to create a pivot table for\nthis\ni'll click on a cell in my data set\nand then i'll go to the insert tab\nhere we have the option to select the\npivot table\ni click on this\nyou can see\nmy table range is selected\nnext i want to place my pivot table in a\nnew worksheet\nand let's just click on ok\nthere you go\nso we have a new sheet where i can place\nmy pivot table\nso first\ni need to find the total revenue\ngenerated by each year\nso what i'll do is\ni'll drag my order year column\nunder rows\nand then\ni'll select the total revenue column\nunder values\nyou can see i have my pivot chart ready\nnow if you want you can sort this\nso from the data you can see we have\norder year from 2010\nto 2017.\nnow\nbased on this data let's create our\npivot chart so i'll click on any cell\ngo to insert and here you have the\noption to select recommended charts i\nclick on this\nnow actually i want a line chart so i'll\nclick on\nline here and select ok\nthere you go so we have successfully\ncreated our first pivot chart\nnow\nlet me show you how you can format this\nchart to make it more readable\nso first\nlet me delete\nthese so i'll right click and select\nhide all field buttons on the chart so\nthis will delete the\nbuttons present on the chart\nnow\nlet me go ahead and\nedit the chart title\nso the title i want is total revenue\ni'll type it down\nby year\nall right\nnext\nlet's do a few more transformations\nso if i click on this plus sign\nwhich is actually for chart elements we\nhave some options like to add access\naccess titles chart title data labels\nthis grid lines legend and\nothers okay\nso\nlet's remove the legend now\nyou can see the total legend is gone\nnow let me\nadd access titles so we'll label our\nx-axis and y-axis so here under x-axis\ni can\nwrite it as\nyear\nsimilarly on the y-axis i'll put\nrevenue\nokay now you can move\na bit\nall right\nnow\nlet me select this chart style option\nand go to colors first\nhere\ni'll select\nyellow color\nokay\nand then let me go back to style\nlet's select a new style from this list\ni want\nthis style okay\nnow\nyou can also add\ndata\nlabels so i'll just click on data labels\nyou can see we have\nthe revenue for each of the years now\nthis is not readable at all\nso we'll format this a bit\nif i click on this arrow\nhere i have more options\nif i scroll down you can see we have\nsomething called as number here\ni'll expand this\nand under category\ni'll select custom\nnow here\nwe'll give a format code\nwhich is a bit different\nso this is actually a kind of a formula\nso i'll write if\nmy revenue value\nis greater than\nlet's say\n9 lakhs\n99 000\nlet me make sure there are six\nnines here so one two three four five\nand six okay we are good to go\ni'll close the bracket\ni'll give a hash\ngive to commas\nso if the revenue is greater than\n9 lakhs 99 000\ni'll put it in the format of millions so\nwithin double quotes i'll write m\ni'll give a semicolon\nfollowed by\nanother hash\nand if the value is less than the\ndesired number\nit should be\n0 million\nlet me click on add\nall right you can see how nicely we have\nformatted our data\nand you see here we have\nadded the new format which is in\nmillions\nall right now if you want you can go\nahead and\nadjust the\nboxes let me move this a bit up i'll\ndelete this\nnow if you notice this line chart you\ncan make a few conclusions\nfor example if you see here in 2010\nthe total revenue generated was nearly\n175 million\nnow this came down to 150 million in\n2011\nthen the revenue constantly grew from\n2011 till 2014\nit reached 195 million\nand after 2000\nit again came down to\n180 million\nand the revenue dropped significantly\nbetween 2016 and 2017.\nin 2017 the revenue was just 96 million\nnow before moving ahead to my next chart\nlet me just rename this sheet\nso i'll write it as\nrevenue\nby year\nall right\nnow\nlet's analyze the revenue generated each\nyear in different regions so for this\nwe'll create another pivot table\nlet me close this\ni'll click on any cell go to insert and\nselect pivot table\ni'll just click ok so that my pivot\ntable is placed on a new sheet\nall right\nnow this time we want the revenue by\neach year and region so first of all\nlet's drag region to\ncolumns\nthen\nlet's drag the order year column under\nrows\nand then\ni'll select total revenue on to values\nso here you can see we have the pivot\ntable ready\nso for 2010 you can see in asia\nthis was the revenue generated\nsimilarly\nif you see for 2013\nthis was the total revenue generated in\neurope\nand\nwe have for other years as well\nnow let's\ncreate a line chart based on this pivot\ntable so i'll select any cell in the\npivot table i'll go to insert\nand i'll click on recommended charts\nfrom this list i'll select my line chart\nand click on ok\nthere you go\nso we have our next pivot chart ready\nso\non the right you see the different\nregions that are present in different\ncolors let me just expand it so that you\ncan see all the regions we have\nso in total we have\nseven regions\nand each of the regions have been\nrepresented in different colors\nso if you notice this graph\nfor the\nsub-saharan african region\nin 2012\nsub-saharan africa made the\nhighest amount of sales\nnow from the sample data you can also\ntell\nthat the revenue for north america has\nbeen significantly low compared to other\nregions\nsimilarly if you see\nfor\neurope\nthis was the revenue trend between 2010\nand 2017\nso if you see here in 2011 the sales\nwere at this level then it significantly\ndropped in 2012\nthen in 2013\nthere was a huge spike and then again\ncame down in 2015 and so on so you can\nmake your own conclusions by looking at\nthese line charts\nnow let's\nformat this chart so first of all let's\ndelete the\nfield buttons present on the chart\nand we'll also\ndelete the legend\nalright now\nlet me just reduce the size of the chart\nnext\nwe'll\nadd a chart title\nso\nwe'll\ngive the title as\nrevenue\nby\nyear and\nregion\nokay\nyou can also format the\ny axis in terms of millions\nso i'll right click on this axis\nand i'll select format access\ni'll scroll down and here we have\nthe number drop down\nlet me scroll again\nunder category i'll select custom\nand\nwe'll use this format that we created\nfor our previous chart there you go you\ncan see\nour access labels have been changed in\nterms of millions now\nso let's close this and let me save it\nnow you can\nreduce the font size or increase the\nfont size let me just show you suppose\nyou want to increase the font size of\nthe chart title so you just select it\nand from here you can either reduce or\nyou can increase you can see now it's 12\nif you want you can make it 16.\nsimilarly you can also edit the\naccess labels also\nby selecting the chart title you can\nalso move it to left or right or you can\nplace it in the center as well for the\ntime being let me just keep it to the\nleft\nall right\nnow\nwe'll see the revenue and total cost\nby each region\nand will create a combo chart for this\nso let me show you how to do it\ni'll go to my data sheet\ni have my cell selected\ni'll go to insert and click on pivot\ntable\nlet me just click on ok\nall right\nso for this\ni'll select\nmy region onto rows\nand then\ni'll have\ntwo columns under values the first one\nis\ngoing to be total revenue\nand the next column will be the total\ncost column\nall right so here we have the reboot\ntable ready now based on this pivot\ntable\nlet's create our pivot chart so i'll go\nto recommended charts and if you see\nbelow\nat the bottom we have combo chart so\nthis is the\npreview of the combo chart\nall right now let me just click on ok\nthere you go so we have a nice combo\nchart ready here\nnow the way to look at it is\nthe bars represent the total revenue\nwhich is this column\nnow\nthe line represents\nthe total\ncost\nso\nlet me go ahead and edit this chart a\nbit so first of all let's delete the\nfield buttons all right and let's also\nremove the legend from here\nnext\nwe'll add\ndata labels so i'll click on data labels\nhere\nokay so these are the\ndata labels for\nthe bars are\nthe revenue column\nnow\nlet's format the data labels in terms of\nmillions so i'll click on this arrow go\nto more options\nif i scroll down\ni have number\nfrom here i'll select custom and\ni'll choose my type that is\nin millions\nall right so you can see we have\nformatted our\ndata\nnext thing we'll add\na chart title\nso here i'll write as\nrevenue\nby\nregion\nit's actually revenue and total cost\nby region\nbefore moving ahead let me\nrename the sheets as well i'll write\nrevenue and\ntotal cost\nsimilarly\nsheet 3 also i'm going to rename it as\nrevenue by\nyear\nand region\nso this\nmakes your sheet more readable\nall right\nnow moving ahead\nnext\nwe are interested to get the revenue\ngenerated by order priority\nand for this we are going to create a\npie chart\nso let's go to the data sheet\nand create our pivot table first\ni click on ok\nnow\ni'll select order priority under rows\nand under values i'll select\ntotal revenue\nso this is a\nvery simple pivot table so you have your\norder priority so c is for critical h is\nfor high l is for low and m is for\nmedium\nnow based on this\nlet's create a pie chart so i'll go to\nrecommended charts and here you have\npie chart\ni want to select\nthis 3d type of pie chart\nand i'll click on ok\nall right so we have our pie chart ready\nlet me just resize it and from here i'll\nremove the fill buttons\nand i also don't need the legend so i'll\ndelete this as well\nall right\nnow let's give a chart title so this is\ngoing to be\nrevenue by\norder\npriority\nnow let's add\nour data labels\ni'll check this option\nokay\nnow let's again format this in terms of\nmillions\nso here\ni'll click on the last option i'll go to\nnumbers\nunder category i'll select custom\nand\nmy type is going to be in terms of\nmillions there you go\nlet me close this\ni will just\nmove this\nto the center\nall right\nnow if you want you can change the color\nof the text as well\nso let's\nhave it in white color and see how it\nlooks okay so this looks pretty decent\ncool\nnow\nmoving to our next report\nso this time\nwe are going to find the total revenue\nby countries so we have multiple\ncountries present in our data set we\nwant to visualize the revenue generated\nin each country\nso for this we are going to create a\nhorizontal bar chart so let me show you\nhow to do it but before moving ahead let\nme just rename this sheet so i'll write\nrevenue\nby\ni'll just put op which stands for order\npriority\nall right\nnow\nlet's create our horizontal bar chart\ni'll go to insert\nclick on pivot table\nand select ok\nso i want my revenue based on different\ncountries so i'll select country\nand put it under rows\nand then\ni'll choose total revenue and place it\nunder values\nso here you have the different country\nnames we have afghanistan this albania\nlet me scroll down you have bangladesh\nthere are\na number of countries you have czech\nrepublic there's estonia france gabon\nsimilarly if you scroll down\nwe have india there's jamaica italy\nand all the way to the bottom if we go\nwe have new zealand this netherlands\nphilippines portugal\nwe also have\nsingapore\nlots and lots of countries\nwe have the uae united states of america\nzimbabwe and others\nall right let me go up\nso based on this pivot table let's\ncreate our pivot chart\nso i'll go to insert and select\nrecommended charts\nfrom here\ni'm going to select the column chart you\ncan see the preview here and let me\nclick on ok\nall right\nso here you can see\nthe different country names at the\nbottom and\nthe revenue for each of the countries\nlet's go ahead and edit this chart\nso first of all i'll delete\nthe field buttons okay\nand let me also remove the legend\nhere i'll write\nrevenue\nby\ncountries\nthis is going to be my\nchart title\nokay\nlet's format this chart a little more\nso i'll click on this option\nand we'll select a new style let's say\ni'll select\nstyle 6\nokay\nand\nlet me now go under colors and we'll\nselect the color of the bars so\nlet's choose this color okay\nso you have\na horizontal column chart ready\nand at the bottom you can see the\ndifferent country names and we have the\nrevenue\ncool\nnow\nlet me go ahead and\nrename this sheet so i'll write\nrevenue by\ncountries\nand hit enter\nokay\nand finally\nwe'll create another report which is\ngoing to be part of our revenue\ndashboard\nand this is\nrevenue by items so we'll visualize\nour revenue for different items present\nin the table\nso if you see this we have\ncosmetics vegetables cereal fruits this\ncloth snacks households and other\nproducts as well\nso let's check the revenue for each of\nthese items\nso we'll continue the same drill i'll\ncreate my pivot table on a new worksheet\nand this time i'm going to drag\nitem type under rows\nand\nwill have the total revenue under values\nso here on the left of the table you can\nsee we have the different\nitem names and then we have the\ntotal revenue so let me just\nshort this\ntotal revenue\nfrom largest to smallest so\nyou can see here office supplies made\nthe highest amount of revenue\nfollowed by household then cosmetics\nand fruits\nmade the lowest amount of revenue\ni'll click on this go to insert and\nselect recommended charts\nthis time i am going to create a bar\nchart so this is how my bar chart is\ngoing to look like\ni'll select ok\nall right\nnow let's format this chart a bit\ni'll delete the field buttons\nand i'll delete the legend as well\nand\nlet's edit the chart title so this is\ngoing to be\nrevenue\nby\nitems\ncool\nwe also want to\nchange the\ncolor of the bars so i've selected all\nthe bars i'll go to my home tab\nand here let's say i want to select\ngreen color\nall right\ni've edited my chart a bit now\nlet's\nmake it\n14\nand i'll remove the\nbold\nokay\nhere if you want you can change the font\nalso let's keep it in blue color all\nright\nfinally\nlet's rename this sheet so i'll write\nrevenue by\nitems\ncool\nfinally\nnow it's time for us to merge\nall the charts that we have created\nto our dashboard\nso let me show you how you can create\nthe dashboard\ni'll create a new sheet\nand first thing i'm going to do is\ni'll click on the view tab and\nuncheck grid lines so this will remove\nthe grid lines present in the worksheet\nnext\ni'm going to insert an image\nso we'll have a background image\non our dashboard\nso the way to do is i'll go to the\ninsert tab and under illustrations\ni have the option to select pictures or\ninsert pictures so i'm going to insert\npicture\npresent on the device that is my\ncomputer\ni'll go to desktop and here i have a\nfolder called\nexcel dashboard files\nand i'll select this dashboard\nbackground and hit insert\nso this is going to insert an image\nnow\nlet me just\ndrag this image so it covers a fair\nenough portion\nso i'll hit shift and i'll drag it\nall right\nso you can see i have successfully\nadded a background image if you want you\ncan still\nexpand this background image\na bit to the right\ncool\nnow the next thing\nis going to be\nthe title of the dashboard so i'll click\non insert and here\ni have the option to select\na text box\nso\ni'll click on a text box and\ni'm going to place a text box in the\nmiddle\nand i'm going to name this text box as\nexcel\nrevenue dashboard\non\nsales\ni'll centralize it\nlet's do some more formatting so i'll\nselect this text box on the top you can\nsee\nshape format\nhere\ni'm going to expand this\nshape fill\nand i'll select no fill\nso\nmy text box is transparent now\nand i'll also remove the outline\nall right\nnow let me just double click on the\ntitle of my dashboard and i'm going to\nselect\na font you can select whichever font you\nwant\nlet me stick to\nbritannica bold\nand i'll increase the size to let's say\n30\nall right\ni'll just\ndrag the\ntext box\ni'll make the text as white instead of\nblack\nall right so we have our\ntitle of the dashboard ready\nnow if you want you can also insert some\nicons to this dashboard so i'll go to\ninsert and i'll click on illustrations\nagain and select\npictures\ni am going to add\nthis to pictures which is of a store and\na cart\nto make it look\nvisually appealing so i'll\nplace the icons\nhere and similarly let me just copy it\nand i'll place\nthe cart and the store\nto the right as well\nall right\nnext\nthe idea is to\nbring in all the charts that we have\ncreated and place it on the dashboard\nso let me copy\neach of the charts and\nplace it\non the dashboard\nso i'll\nhit\nctrl v to paste it\nand we'll resize this as well\nall right\nsimilarly let me bring in all the other\ncharts as well\nall right so now you can see i have\nadded\nall my charts and graphs to this\ndashboard\nso you can see here we have\nour line charts our\ncolumn charts the combo charts this pie\nchart\nand others\nnow let me go ahead and\nformat these\ncharts a little more so you can see this\nlooks a bit cluttered\nso let's adjust the\nlabels let me bring this down\nsimilarly i'll bring\n190 million\na little below\nall right\nthis looks fine now\none more thing we are going to do is\nwe'll remove the\nwhite background from each of the charts\nand make it transparent so let me show\nyou how to do it so i'll select this\nchart\nthen i'll right click\nand go to\nformat chart area\nhere on the right you see we have an\noption called no fill so if i select no\nfill you can see the white background\nis gone now\nsimilarly let me also remove the grid\nlines so i'll select the grid lines and\nhit delete so you have also removed the\ngrid lines from here now\nlet's also remove the white outline that\nwe have so i'll select this chart\ngo to format\nand here\ni'll go to shape outline and i'll select\nno outline\nyou see this\nso we have our total revenue by year\nwhich is a line chart\nand this is completely transparent now\nnow what i'm going to do is\ni'll place this chart over a box\nso i'll go to insert and in insert we\nhave the option to create a shape\nso i'll\nclick on illustrations and here\ni'll choose a shape\nand let me select a rectangle\nso i'll just\ncreate a rectangle here\nall right\nand now\nwhat i'll do is\ni'll select this and bring this to front\ni'll right click\nand choose\nbring to front\nand i'll place this\nshape\nbelow it\nall right\nnow the next thing is to edit the shape\nso first i'll change the color of this\nbox so let me select this blue color\nand\nand let me increase the transparency so\ni'll\nright click and go to format shape\nhere i'll increase the transparency\nlet's keep it to\n25 percent\nor let's say\n20 percent\nall right\nnext thing\nwe'll just convert all the\nfont to white color\nincluding the access labels\nthe chart title\nwill also\nconvert all the\naccess labels to white color so it looks\nbetter\nnow we'll just\nadjust our\nchart over here\nnext thing let's just\nremove the outline so i'll go to shape\noutline and i'll select no outline\nyou see\nwe have now formatted our chart\nlet's just\npull this a little up\nall right\nnow we'll add\nthis blue background to all the other\ncharts so we'll first add the background\nmake it transparent and then we'll\nconvert the font text to white color to\nmake it more\nreadable and visible so\nfor the time being i'll just pause the\nvideo and come back again\nall right so now you can see on your\nscreens\nwe have nicely formatted our dashboard\nso\ni've added a few logos for\neach of the\ncharts you can see the logos here so for\nrevenue by countries we have a globe\nthen if you see here this is kind of a\nmap or a location\nsimilarly we have all formatted the\ncolor of the bars\nthen we have also formatted the\nlabels in terms of millions\nif you look on the y-axis even the\nrevenue for year and region are all\nformatted in terms of millions\nif you want this you can also format the\ntotal year by revenue in terms of\nmillions\nso the way to do is you can select this\ngraph\nright click and go to format access\nhere if i scroll down\nyou have numbers\nand\nunder category i'll select custom\nthen i'll select my type as\nthis format which is in millions\nand\nyou see here we have successfully\nformatted our\ny-axis labels\nall right\nso the next thing\nis to add slicers and timelines to a\ndashboard\nnow slicers are used to format your data\nbased on a particular column suppose if\nyou want to see revenue by\ncertain items you can add item as a\nslicer and you can view the entire\ndashboard similarly\nfor timelines you can add\ndate columns so if you want to see what\nwas the amount of sales or revenue\ngenerated on a particular year or a\nparticular month you can do that using a\ntimeline\nso\ni'll select one of the charts\nand then\neither you can go to the insert tab and\nhere you can see under filters we have\nslices and timeline\nor\nif you go to the\npivot chart analyze tab\nhere also you have\ninsert slicer and timeline option\nso i'll select insert slicer here first\nnow it's giving me the list of\nfields present in the\ndata set so i'll select\ncountry\nregion\nand let's say\nwe want to\nknow by\nitem type and sales channel so these are\ngoing to be my four slicers i'll click\non ok\nyou can see it here we have our\nfour slicers here and these are the list\nof values under region we have asia\nthis europe north america and others\nsimilarly we have the different country\nnames for country slicers\nand then for item type also we have all\nthe items that were present in our data\nset\nnow\nmoving ahead we need to connect\nall the slices to a dashboard\nso what i'll do is\ni'll right click\non this option\nand i'll go to report connections\nokay so under report connections you\nhave\nall the pivot tables that we created\nyou currently see only one of the pivot\ntable is selected so we need to\nselect all the pivot tables so let me\ncheck\nall the pivot tables present in this\nworkbook and click on ok\nall right now that we have connected\none of our slicers will now connect the\nother\nremaining slicers\nso i'll right click on this go to report\nconnections\nand i'll check\nall the pivot tables present in this\nworksheet\nclick on ok\nsimilarly let's do it for the country\nslicer\ni'll go to report connections and let me\nselect\nall the pivot tables\nand finally we have\nthe item type so i'll right click\ngo to report connections and then i'll\nselect\nall my pivot tables\nand let's hit ok\nall right now let me just\norganize this a bit so i'll\nplace my pivot tables\nto the right\ni'll just reduce the size\nlet me scroll down\ni'll add\nmy region slicer here\nsimilarly\ni'll add my final slicer that is\nsales channel\nnow in our next dashboard which is going\nto be the profit dashboard i'll show you\nhow to add a timeline\nall right\nnow i have arranged all my slicers\nso let's say you want to find the\nrevenue that was generated for\nan item type let's say\nbeverages so you can just select\nbeverages here\nand\nall your charts\nso the respective revenues so you have\nthe total revenue by year for\nbeverages only\nsimilarly here you can see the revenue\nby year and region only for\nbeverages item type\nif i scroll down\nnow this chart represents the\nrevenue that was generated in each of\nthe countries only for item type\nbeverages\nlet me just uncheck it\nall right\nlet's say you want to see\nthe revenue generated for a country like\nindia\nso i have selected india here\nand now you can see\nmy graph has changed only for\ncountry india\nyou can see here it is showing only for\nindia now\nnow similarly you can also filter your\nrevenues based on the different regions\nlet's say you want to\nknow the revenue generated\nbased on sales channel so we have two\nsales channel that is offline and online\nsuppose you want to know the revenue\ngenerated offline\nso i'll just\nselect\noffline you can see\nthe values have changed so these were\nthe revenues generated for each of the\nitems only for offline\nif you\nsee here\nnow these were all the\noffline seals for the different regions\nso\nthis is\nour entire\nexcel revenue dashboard on sales\nwe created multiple charts and graphs\nthen we applied\ndifferent formatting we added\ndifferent icons then we formatted the\nlabels also\nnext we added\nslicers\nand\nfinally we saw how we could filter our\ndata based on these slicers\nlikewise now we are going to create a\nprofit dashboard based on the same data\nso before moving ahead let me rename\nthis\nsheet as\nrevenue dashboard i'll write rev\ndashboard\nokay\nnow\nwe move to our datasheet and\nstart creating our pivot tables and\npivot charts for the profit dashboard\nall right so let me go ahead and create\nmy first pivot table\nso\ni'll create\na new worksheet\nthis time i am going to create a line\nchart\nto visualize the profit for each year\nso i will drag my\ntotal profit column\nto values and\nmy order year to rows\nso here you can see we have our\npivot table ready\nnow you can sort this data\nto\nget an idea\nas to which\nyear had the highest profit and which\nyear had the lowest profit so from this\npivot table you can see since i've\nsorted this data in\ndescending order so 2014\nhad the maximum amount of profit and\n2017 had the least amount of profit\ni'll just do control z to undo it all\nright now based on this pivot table let\nme go ahead and create my po chart so\ni'll go to recommended charts and click\non a line chart so this is the preview\nof the chart\ni'll click on ok\nlet me close this\nsimilarly\nwe are going to\nedit this chart now so first i'll hide\nall the field buttons present on the\nchart\nand i'll\nrename the chart title as\ntotal\nprofit\nby year\nnext i'm going to remove the legend so\ni'll delete this\nlet's do some more formatting\nso\ni'll go to style\nand\nthis time\ni'm going to select\nmy style type okay\nand if you want you can\nchoose the colors as well for the time\nbeing let's have\nthis yellow color\nnext let me add the\ndata labels so again if you see here\nthis is not formatted properly\nso let's go ahead and format the\ndata labels\nso i'll click on number\nand i'll select custom here\nand the type i'm going to select is in\nmillions\nand i'll click on\nclose so here you can see we have our\nline chart ready which shows total\nprofit by year\nlet's\nrename this sheet as\nprofit\nby\nyear\nall right\nnow let's move back to our\ndata sheet again\nnext\nwe are going to\nshow the total profit by countries for\nthis i am going to create a map so let\nme first create my pivot table\nso i'll go to insert and i'll click on\npivot table\nlet me click on ok\nsince i want\nthe country names so i'll select country\nunder rows and then i have\nmy total profit under values\nthe next thing i'm going to do is i'll\njust rename the row labels as\ncountries\nand then\ni'm going to delete the\ngrand total which you can see at the\nbottom so here we have the grand total\nlet me just delete the grand total so\ni'm going to select this pivot table\ngo to the design tab\nhere we have subtotals and grand totals\ni'll\nswitch off the grand total let me just\nverify it again i'll scroll down you see\nthe grand total has gone now\nall right\nnow\nwe want to create a\nmap out of this the way to do is\ni'm going to\nselect my data\ncopy it\ni'll go on top\nand i'll paste it here\nusing this data i can create my field\nmap now so i'll go to insert here we\nhave the option to create a field map\nthere you go\nyou can see we have our map ready\ni can expand this\nas you can see\nour map has a color scale which comes\nfrom light gray color to dark blue color\nso the countries that are in gray or you\ncan say light blue\nhave the lowest amount of profit\nwhile the regions or the countries that\nhave been shaded in\ndark color\na dark blue color have highest amount of\nprofit\ni will go ahead and delete this\nscale\nok\nnext\nwe need to connect this\nmap to the original data source so what\ni'll do is\ni'll right click on this map and i'll go\nto select data\nhere instead of the previous range i'll\ngive my\nnew range now so\nmy new range will be my original pivot\ntable that i had created\ni'll go on top and click on ok\nso we have our\nmap ready now\nnow if you want you can change the\ncolor of the shade so i'll just go to\ncolors\nand let's say we'll keep green color\nso the countries that are shaded in dark\ngreen have the highest amount of profit\nwhile those which are highlighted in\nlight green color are\nare the countries that made\nleast amount of profit\nokay\nnow moving on\nnext\nwe want to create\na pivot table\nthat will show us the profit by\nyear and sales channel\nso for this we are going to create\nanother line chart\nso i'll go to insert and click on pivot\ntable so i'll select\nnew worksheet\nhere\nsince i want to know the profit by year\nfirst of all i'll drag my order year\ncolumn to rows\nand then\ni'll choose my total profit column under\nvalues\nnext i'm going to select my sales\nchannel under columns\nthere you go so we have our pivot table\nhere\nnow based on this pivot table let me\ncreate my pivot chart so i'll go to\nrecommended charts\nand i'm going to create a line chart\ni close this\nyou see here\nbased on this\nchart you can tell\nthe profit generated with\nonline\nsales were actually\nlower than that of offline so here the\nblue line represents offline profit and\nthe orange line represents online profit\nif you mark clearly\nin year 2012 the online profit was\nactually higher than the offline profit\nso\nlet me go ahead and\nedit this chart a bit so we'll delete\nthe field buttons i'll also delete the\nlegend for now\nlet me go ahead and\nadd\na chart title so i'll write\nprofit\nby\nyear\nand\nsales\nchannel\nokay\nso this is my\nsecond report\nbefore moving ahead let me just\nrename this sheet so i'll write\nprofit\nby\ncountries\nsimilarly\nlet me\nrename this sheet as\nprofit\nby\nyear and let's say sc for sales channel\nokay\nmoving ahead\nnow i want to\ncreate a pie chart\nbased on a pivot table that will show\nthe profit by sales channel only so this\nis going to be a simple pie chart so\ni'll first\ngo to insert click on pivot table and\nclick on ok\nso i'll drag my sales channel under rows\nand then we'll have the total profit\ncolumn under values\nso this is my simple pivot table\nnow let's create our pivot chart which\nis going to be a pie chart\nlet me explore\nthe other types of pie charts we have\nokay so i'm going to select a donut\nchart here i click on ok\nlet's\nedit this chart i'll remove the field\nbuttons\nlet me now remove the legend as well\ni'll just resize it\nand this is going to be\nprofit\nby\nsales channel\nokay\nlet's also add\ndata labels\nand here again\ni'm going to\nformat this label\ni'll select the category as custom\nand my type\nwill be in millions okay\nlet me just\nmove this\nto the left\nand this to the right\nokay\nlet's also delete the lines cool\nnow let me just rename this sheet so\ni'll write\nprofit\nby\nlet's say c which stands for sales\nchannel\ncool\nfinally\ni'm going to create a report that will\nshow the revenue and profit by items\nso i'll go ahead and create my\npivot table first\nthis time i'll choose my\ntotal profit under values\nand will also have\nthe revenue column\nso i'll put my revenue at the top\nthen\ni'm going to select\nitem type under rows\nso here is my pivot table\nbased on this pivot table\nlet me now\ncreate a combo chart so you can see the\npreview of the chart\nthe blue bars represent the total\nrevenue and the orange line represents\nthe total profit\ni'll click on ok\nlet me close this\nfirst let's remove the field buttons\nlet's also remove\nthe legend here\nthen we'll add a chart title\ni'll name it as\nrevenue\nand\nprofit\nby\nitems\nokay\nif you want you can also go ahead and\nchange the color of the bars\nso let me just select\none of these colors okay\nall right\nso we have our five reports ready that\nwe are going to use\nfor our profit dashboard\nnext let's create a new sheet\nand we'll get started with building a\ndashboard\nso i'll click on a new sheet let me just\nrename this as\nprofit dashboard\nall right\nwe'll continue with the previous drill\nso\nfirst of all let's go to\nthe view tab and remove the grid lines\nnow\nwe'll\ninsert a background image\nlike we did for our revenue dashboard so\ni'll go to insert\nunder illustrations i'll click on\npictures and select this device\ni'm going to have the same background\ni'll click on insert\nall right so you can see we have a\npicture of a company or you can say an\norganization\nlet's just\ndrag this\na bit to the right\nwe'll adjust the size also\nall right\nnow let's copy the title of my profit\ndashboard\nso here you can see i have brought my\nrevenue dashboard\nand i'll copy the title and the logos\nthat we used\nfor the revenue dashboard i'll paste it\non my new dashboard\nlet's just align it\nin the center\nall right the next step\nlet me now go ahead and edit the title\nso this is actually going to be\nexcel\nprofit dashboard instead of revenue\nnow\nwe'll copy each of the charts that we\njust created for example\nthe revenue and profit by items then we\nhad\nprofit by sales channel\nall this we are going to copy one by one\nand put it on the profit dashboard\nso let me just copy a few now\nwe'll paste it here\nand later on we can make the adjustment\ncopy this as well\nsimilarly i'll bring the other three\ncharts on to my sales dashboard\nokay so here on my\nprofit dashboard i have added all the\ncharts\nand i have aligned and reshaped it so\nthat it looks good\ni have also\nmade some formatting for example i have\nreduced the size of the\nchart title\nnow let me go ahead and\nshow you a few more formatting that we\nalso did for the revenue dashboard first\nlet's remove the white background from\nall the charts so i'll\nselect\nthe first chart i'll right click and\ni'll click on\nformat chart area\nhere under fill i'll select no fill\nnext i'm going to remove the grid lines\nso i'll just delete it\nlet me close this\nnow we also have a\noutline so i'll go to design\nactually format and i'll remove the\noutline\nnext i'm going to add\na blue box at the back like how we did\nfor the revenue dashboard so let me\nselect a blue box from here and i'm\ngoing to paste it here\nokay\nlet me just select\nthe chart and i'll bring this to front\nand i'll move this\nto the back\nnext i'm going to change the font color\nall to white\nso that it's clearly visible and it's\nmore readable\ni'll do it for the x-axis as well okay\nso here\ni have my first\nchart ready\nthe same i'm going to do for the rest of\nthe charts\nokay so now you can see here\ni have formatted all my charts i have\nalso added a blue background\nyou see here i have also formatted the\ny labels in terms of millions which is\nactually the profit\nsimilarly here i have added the data\nlabels this is for revenue\nsome of the charts also have the data\nlegends so here you can see the blue\ncolor represents offline\nand the red represents online similarly\nhere\nyou have the legends\ni've also formatted the\nmap as well\nokay\nnow the next thing\nis to make this dashboard more\ninteractive so we'll add our\nslicers as well as timeline\nfirst let me show you how to add a\ntimeline\nso i'll\nselect one of the charts and i'll go to\ninsert under insert i have the option to\ncreate a timeline\nso i'll just\nclick on timelines\nso timeline is actually based on date\ncolumns so since in our data set we only\nhave two date columns one is order date\nand one is ship date so excel has only\nshown us two columns so i'm going to\ncreate my timeline based on order date\nso i'll select my order date column and\ni'll click on ok\nyou can see here this is called a\ntimeline i can expand this\nnow this timeline is based on months now\nand if i\nscroll this timeline you can see here i\nhave\nmy\norder year 2010 and i have all the 12\nmonths similarly we have for 2011 then\nwe have for 2012\nall the way till 2017.\nnow you can filter this in terms of\nyears quarters months or days let me\njust select year now so i have\nyears from 2010 till 2017.\nlet me just squeeze this\nand i'll place it somewhere here\non the right\nnow let me go ahead and create a few\nslicers for my profit dashboard so i\nhave selected one of the charts\nunder insert i'll click on slicer\nyou can see it gives me the list of\ncolumns from which i want to create\nslicers\nso i'll create a region\nlet me also select\ncountry\nlet's say i want\nthe representative's name or the\ncustomer's name\nand i'll click on ok\nso here i have created three slicers\nlet me\nfirst\nresize it and\ni'll place it\non the right\nsimilarly i'll place the\ncountry column also\nthen we have\nthe region slicer\ni'll\nresize this and i'll bring it here okay\nthe next thing we need to do is\ni have to\nconnect all the slicers and the timeline\nto\nthe pivot tables\nfor the profit dashboard so i am going\nto click on\nthe multiple select option and go to\nreport connections here\ni am going to select\nall the pivot tables that are related to\nprofit\nso here i have selected\nfour and i need one more which is\npivot table number 10 i click on ok\nsimilarly let's create\nor connect my region filter to all the\npivot tables so i right click\ngo to report connections here i'll\nchoose all my pivot tables which are\nbased on profit\ni'll click on ok\nlet's do it for the country slicer as\nwell\nclick on ok\nand similarly i'll connect my\ntimeline as well i'll go to report\nconnections\nand i'll select\nall the pivot tables related to profit\nthen i'll click on ok\nlet me now go ahead and create another\nslicer based on sales channel so i am\nselecting one of the pivot charts\ni'll go to insert click on slicer\nand i'll select\nsales channel and hit ok\nso i have my sales channel\nslicer now let me connect it to all the\nrespective pivot tables\nthat are based on profit\nclick on ok\nnow\nlet me just bring it here\nall right\nthe next thing i want to show is\nhow are we going to use the timeline\nfirst\nso you see we have all the\nyears here from 2010 till 2017.\nnow suppose\nwe want to know the profit that was\ngenerated in the year 2012 so i'll just\nclick on\nthis range and now you can see our\ncharts only show information for 2012 so\nthis dot represents there was 51 million\nprofit in the year 2012. similarly you\ncan see here\nthe profit by sales channel for 2012.\nfrom the map you can see the different\ncountries and the profit\neach of these countries made in 2012.\nif i scroll down you can see\nthe revenue and profit by items\nnow\nif i select\nanother year let's say 2013 i can just\ndrag this to the right and\nnow you can see\nour profit by year and sales channel for\noffline and online you can see the map\nor the line chart for total profit by\nyear so in 2012 it was 51 million and\nthen it\nwent up to 54 million in 2013.\nsimilarly\nour map has also changed now this is a\nsort of an information that we have you\ncan click on this and\ncheck the information that\nexcel has prompted\nall right so this is how you can use a\ntimeline\nnow as i said\nwe checked by\nyears you can also see it for months and\nquarters as well\nlet me just\nuncheck it\ni'll\nsend it back to the place where it was\nand i'll reduce the size\nokay\nnow suppose\nyou want to check the profit made by\ndifferent representatives you can select\nthem one by one\nlet's say adam churchill this is the\nprofit generated by\nadam churchill\nsimilarly\nyou can select multiple persons as well\nnow suppose you want to see the profit\nby different countries so you can use\nthe country slicer\nlet me just bring this to the middle\nand\nlet's expand our chart a bit\nokay so here you have the\nprofit by different countries chart i'll\njust\nbring this to the front so that you can\nsee it clearly\nokay\nnow here suppose you want to see the\nprofit generated\nin let's say united kingdom you can\nselect united kingdom so this is the map\nof united kingdom and it tells you the\ntotal profit that was generated in\nunited kingdom\nand\nbelow you can see\nthe revenue and profit\nfor all the items that was sold in\nunited kingdom so you had beverages\nclothes household office supplies so you\ncan see clearly\noffice supplies item made the highest\namount of profit in\nunited kingdom\nnow you can also select\nmultiple countries let's say\ni want to know for france as well\nso my\nmap will change accordingly so now i\nhave\nunited kingdom and france selected and\nthe other charts present\nin my dashboard change accordingly\nnow i have my\ncountry selected as india you can see\nthe map of india here\nand these were the respective profit\nvalues\nnow one thing to note here is this is\nactually\nnot millions that should be in k that is\nthousands so please mark this as\nthousand and not in millions\neven for this this is actually k and\nnaught million\nall right\nso we have successfully\ncreated our second dashboard that is\non\nprofit\nlet me just resize this a bit and we'll\nplace it\nwhere it was earlier\ncool\nso we saw\nhow to create different pivot tables in\npivot charts and then we formatted our\npivot charts based on our requirement we\nsaw how to edit the colors now let me\nshow you one more thing\nyou can also change the\nlook and feel of the dashboard by going\nto the page layout tab under page layout\nyou have themes so here you can select\ndifferent themes currently we are with\nthe office theme now let me just select\nanother theme let's say face it\nyou see\nthe colors have changed and it looks\nreally beautiful\nsimilarly let me try out\nanother\ntheme let's say organic\nyou see\nour chart has changed let me just delete\nthis okay so now once you change the\ntheme the\ntext also change a bit you can see\nthe slicers are in a different font\nlet me explore one more theme let's say\nthis time i am going to choose\ndepth\nand\nthis is more\nof a\ngreen type of color\nyou can play around and select\nwhatever theme suits the best\nall right\nnow let me just move back to my revenue\ndashboard and see how it looks\nthere you go\nso since we changed our theme even our\nrevenue dashboard is also impacted\nso\nthis is how it looks now\nyou can always go ahead and\nplay with different themes colors fonts\nand effects\nall right\nso in this demo we saw how to create a\nrevenue dashboard so we created line\ncharts this combo chart pie chart\nhorizontal and vertical\nbar charts and then we learnt how to add\nslicers and connected to different pivot\ntables\nand we filtered our data to see\nrevenue as well as profit by items by\ncountries by different regions\nsales channel\nwe learned how to create\na map\nand lots more\nlet's learn about visualization\nand here we will learn about\nr\nwhich can be used for your visualization\nnow\none thing which we need to understand is\nbecause of our ability to see patterns\nwhich is highly developed we\ncan understand\nthe data better if we can visualize it\nso the efficient way or effective way to\nunderstand what is in our data or what\nwe have understood in our data we should\nor we can use graphical displays that is\nyour data visualization so there are\nactually two types of data\nvisualizations so you have exploratory\ndata visualization which helps us to\nunderstand the data and then you have\nexplanatory visualization which helps us\nto share our understanding with others\nso when you talk about r r provides\nvarious tools and packages to create\ndata visualizations\nand which can be used for both kind of\ndata analysis or both kind of\nvisualizations\nso when you talk about exploratory data\nand visualization the key is to keep all\nthe potentially relevant details\ntogether\nnow the objective when we talk about\nexploratory data analysis is to\nhelp you see what is in your data\nand the main question is how much\ndetails can\nwe interpret\nnow when you talk about different\nfunctions which we see here such as plot\nwhich is more for a generic\nplotting you have bar plot which is used\nto plot data using rectangular bar so\nyou can say creating bar charts you have\nhistogram or hist function to create\nhistograms where you look at the\nfrequency\nof\nthe data or basically used to look at\nthe central tendency of the data you\nhave box plot which is used to represent\ndata in the form of quartiles you have\ngg plot which is a package which enables\nthe user to create sophisticated\nvisualizations with the little code\nusing the grammar of graphics and then\nyou have plotly or plot l y it creates\ninteractive\nweb-based graphs via the open source\njavascript graphing library now before\nwe see some examples here let's also\ntalk about when you talk about plotting\nlet's also try to understand what kind\nof\nplots you can have and what kind of\ntechniques you have so let me open up my\nr studio here now for example i can pull\nout a particular data set\nand let's look at this one\nso\nhere i can look at\nall the panes and that shows me the\ninformation now what i can do is i can\ninstall\nand get the inbuilt data sets and then i\ncan simply do a plot\nwherein i am doing a plot on jquery data\nset so let's see what does that show it\nsummarizes the relationship between four\nvariables in check weight data frame\nwhich is\nin our's built-in data set package\nnow from these plots we can see for\nexample weight\nvaries systematically over time\nyou can also see that chicks were\nassigned to four different diets\nnow when we talk about explanatory data\nanalysis\nor visualization that shows others what\nwe found in the data this means we need\nto make some editorial decisions\nwhat features we would want to highlight\nfor emphasis\nwhat features are distracting or\nconfusing and you want them to be\neliminated right so there are different\nways of doing it now when you talk about\nyour graphics or visualizations you have\ni would say\nthree different types or you can say\nfour so you have the base graphics which\nis easiest to learn now here we are\nhaving an example of base graphics\nwhere i can use the base graphics\ni can get a\ndata set using library\nthen i can simply create using plot\nfunction to\na generate a simple scatter plot of\ncalories with sugar from us serial data\nframe in the mass package\nand then i can give it a title so this\nis basically a simple example of base\ngraphics now you also have what we call\nas grid graphics which is powerful set\nof modules for building other tools\nnow you also have latest graphics which\nis general purpose system based on grid\ngraphics and then you have your gg plot\n2 which implements grammar of graphics\nand is based on grid graphics so you\nhave different ways now here since i\nalready have used library and i have the\ndata set i can just do a x so i can\nassign the\nsugar related values to x and calories\nrelated value to y\nthen i can use one more which is\nlibrary function and calling in grid now\ni can basically use functions such as\npush view port if i would want to create\na plot using your grid graphics to\ncreate the similar kind of plot which we\ncreated using base graphics but this\nwill give you much more power than base\ngraphics\nit will have a steep learning curve but\nit is usually useful so i can do this\nwhere i'm saying push view port\nthen i can basically say i would want to\nhave a data viewport\ni would say different functions of your\ngrid package so i'm saying rectangle you\nhave x axis y axis given some points\nhere\nand then basically you can add details\nto the graph by giving the names to the\ncolumns and you can\nbasically create a simple grid graphics\nbased plot here\nnow\nthere are different other options which\nwe can use to create plots now before we\ngo into understanding how you create\nplots let me just give you a brief on\nwhat are the different kind of plots and\nhow they can be used so here we will\nlook at these different plots now for\nexample\nwe have a bar chart which is a graph\nwhich shows comparisons across\ndiscrete categories\nso you have x-axis which will show the\ncategories being compared and y-axis\nwhich represents a measured value and\nheight of the bars are proportional to\nmeasured values\nnow\nto create different kind of charts you\ncan use ggplot which is a package for\ncreating graphs in r\nit is basically a method of thinking\nabout and decomposing complex graphs\ninto logical subunits\nand that is a part of tidy works\necosystem so it takes each component of\ngraph accesses you can give scales you\ncan give colors you can give the objects\nand you can build graphs on particular\ndata you can modify each of those\ncomponents in a way that's more flexible\nand user friendly you can if you are not\nproviding details for the components\nthen ggplot will use sensible defaults\nand this basically makes it a powerful\nand flexible tool now here\nare\ndifferent options when you use your gg\nplot such as you can use geom or what we\ncall as geometric objects to form the\nbasis of different type of graphs for\nbar charts you have for line graphs you\nhave scatter plots that is underscore\npoint you have underscore box plot for\nbox plots you have quartile for\ncontinuous x violin for richer display\nof distribution and jitter for small\ndata so here is some simple example\nwhere i would not go into too many\ndetails here but you can just have a\nlook at this one where we are\nusing library function to get the\nggplot2 package\nthen basically we would want to look\ninto the mileage data we would want to\nlook at the structure of it\nand then we can basically get the tidy\nwords package finally we can create a\nbar chart using geo underscore bar\nand we can basically also mention what\nwould be in x-axis now you can also give\ndifferent colors to basically add more\nmeaning to your data\nyou could also go for stacked bar charts\nso here we are actually telling ggplot\nto map the data in the drive column to\nfill the aesthetic so here i am giving\naesthetic access class and i'm saying\nwhat is the data we need to have and\nthen we are using geom underscore bar\nso you can also have dodged bar\nin your ggplot that is not bar charts\nwhich are stacked but next to each other\nand you can create that by using\nyour position as position underscore\ndodge\nokay now you can obviously use your\ndifferent packages which are inbuilt and\nyou can create your bar charts\nand you have other kind of graphs such\nas line graph which is basically a type\nof graph that displays information as a\nseries of data points connected by\nstraight line segments such as this one\nand for this one we are using if you see\ngeo underscore line\nnow you can also create a scatter plot\nwhich is a two dimensional\ndata visualization that uses points\nto graph the values of two different\nvariables one in an x axis one on y axis\nlike what we saw in base graphics\nexample\nand they are mainly used if you would\nwant to assess the relationship or lack\nof relationship between two variables\nand you also have histogram which i\nmentioned is mainly to look at the\ndistribution of a data to look at the\ncentral tendency of the data\nbasically looking at\nyour\nlarge amount of data for a single\nvariable\nyou would be interested in saying where\nis\nmore data found in terms of frequency\nwhere is lesser data found in the graph\nhow close the data is towards its\nmid point or what we call as mean median\nmode\nso\nyou can use histogram where you can\ncategorize the data in what we call as\nbins so these are some basics on\ndifferent kind of graphs now we can look\nat some examples and see how that works\nso what we were seeing is some quick\nexamples of base graphics or grid\ngraphics now here\nlet's do\nan example of pie chart for different\nproducts and units sold so you want to\ncreate a graph for this first let's\ncreate a vector and pass in the value\nhere\nnow i can also create labels which i\nwould want to assign to these values\nand then basically i can plot the chart\nby saying pi so that's the kind of chart\nwhich i would want to create\nand i would say the data would be x\nand labels\nso let's do this and that shows me a\nsimple pie chart now i can also give\nmain details here so instead of just\ndoing a pi x comma labels i can say what\nis the main and then\nwhat kind of coloring it should follow\nso this is the way you can create a\nsimple\nuh plot now i can also\nfind out what is the percentage\nand\nthen basically\ni would be interested in plotting the\npie chart which takes x\nwhich takes the labels which will be the\npercentage which we are calculating here\nby doing a round function\nand then you can basically give details\nto your\ngraph you can say what color it follows\nyou can basically look at the legend\nwhere it needs to be\nin your chart\nwhat are the values\nand then basically fill up the colors so\nlet's run this one and that shows me the\npercentage which was calculated and it\ngives me the details and we can always\nhave a look at our plot now if you would\nwant to go for a 3d pie chart then\nyou can get the package which is plotrix\nlet's use that by calling in the library\nfunction let's pass in some data to x\nand let's give some values or labels\nwhich will make more meaning to the data\nand then let's plot the 3d graph so i'm\nsaying pi 3d here where i'm using x and\nlabels\nthen i'm basically doing an explode\nwhich will basically control how your\ngraph looks like\nand basically give the values so it also\ntakes the title when you say main and by\nchart of countries\nnow let's create\ndata for graph so again we are having a\nvariable here we are create using the c\nfunction creating a vector\nand then let's create a histogram for\nthis one\nwhere i would say x-lab what would be\nyour data around x-axis what is the\ncolor what is the border and here i'm\ncreating a simple histogram\nwhich as i discussed earlier will always\nshow\nyour values on the x-axis and y-axis is\nmore of frequency\nand then you can look at the set of\nvalues and what is their frequency\nand we can basically use this histogram\nfor exploratory data analysis look at\nthe data try to understand what is the\ncentral tendency of your data values\nnow we can also give some limits by\nusing the x limb and y limb and then i\ncan also specify what is the limit so we\nhave given some values here wherein we\nhave said your x limit is 0 to 40\nand y limit is 0 to 5. now if you\ncompare this with the previous one which\nwe had created\nthis one based on the frequency had\ntaken the limits but we can assign\nlimits\nexplicitly by giving this and then\ncreate a histogram which makes more\nmeaning now let's take\nanother data set that is air quality\nlet's view this to see what does that\ndata contain so you have\nozone solar wind temperature month and\nthe day so this is the kind of\ninformation we have in the air quality\nnow let's use the plot function to draw\na scatter plot where as i mentioned you\nwould be interested in analyzing\nvariables\nand see\nwhat is the relationship between them so\nto plot a graph between ozone and wind\nvalues\nso we will say plot we will say the data\nwhich is air quality from that i would\nbe interested in the ozone column or\nozone field and the wind field i can\ncreate a plot based on this\nnow i can also be saying what should be\nthe color what is the type of the data\nwhich you would want to create and you\ncan look at the info information so you\ncan create a histogram you can create a\nscatter plot to basically understand the\ndata better and then infer some\ninformation from that data\nso let's take the air quality data set\nitself without specifying any particular\ncolumn and you can create a plot which\nshows me\nall the different values which you have\nin the data\nand it basically shows you the\ndifference this is more of an example\nlike what we did for chickweight where\nwe did a base graphics now you can\nassign labels to the plot so that is\nwhen you are creating a plot you can say\nair quality you will say ozone\nand then that's your ozone concentration\nyou have your y lab which is the number\nof instances\nyou have what is the title ozone levels\nin new york city what is the color so\nthese are the details what we have given\nwith our plot function and let's look at\nthe data so it just tells me that this\nis the ozone concentration\nuh the number of instances what you have\nand you are looking at the data now we\ncould also create a histogram by picking\nup a particular column that is such as\nsolar\nfrom your air quality and that basically\nshows me the frequency\nof solar values and we can then try to\nfind out what is the mid\nwhat is the mean what is the standard\ndeviation and so on you can also look at\nyour histogram and try to understand if\nit is left skewed and right skewed so we\ncan do that\nnow here let's get the temperature out\nfrom this particular data set\nlet's create a histogram on temperature\nand that basically shows me the\nfrequency of the temperature values\nand\nwhat values have the most frequency or\nmost occurrence\nnow you can create a histogram\nwith\nlabels\nso let's do that with the limit\nand then let's also use text to\nbasically given the values which also\ntakes the values and for each set of\nfrequency or each set of values it gives\nme the labels now you can have a\nhistogram with non-uniform width so you\ncould do that by doing a hist function\nand then\npassing in your temperature you can say\nwhat will be the main what is the title\nwhat will be your x lab\nit will tell you a limit around x axis\nwhat is the color what is the border\nwhat are the breaks you would want to\nhave\nfor your bars and you can simply create\na histogram using this so this basically\ntakes the breaks which we have given\nsuch as 55 to 60\n60 to 70 70 to 75 and so on so this is\nbasically creating a histogram with\nnon-uniform width\nand it purely depends on the kind of\nvalues what you have\nnow you can also create a box plot which\nsometimes helps us in understanding the\nthe data quartiles also understanding\nour outliers so you can create multiple\nbox plots based on the data from air\nquality so we'll select all the data and\nthen we'll do some slicing on the data\nso let's create a box plot which tells\nme the values and if you look at these\npoints here\nlike single dots these are basically\nyour outliers\nwe can learn about that more\nin later sections\nso you can use\nyour gg plot 2 library to analyze\na particular data set so for that we\nwill first\nuse the install dot packages and get\nggplot2\nso it says do you want to restart r and\ni can say yes so let it get the package\ni think the package was already there\nand now\nlet's look at\nusing ggplot2 so for that i have the\nlibrary function\nand let's do a attach where i'm getting\na data set which is empty cars\nnow\nthen i will create a variable p1 i will\nuse ggplot i will pass in my data i'll\ngive the aesthetics\nwhat is the columns which you would be\ninterested in\nand then you are using geom underscore\nbox plot to basically create a plot\nwhich gives me the box plot for the\nvalues here and this is based on\nthe cylinders which is there in your\ndata\nso we can always look at what does our\ndata contain\nand what kind of values or features are\navailable in the data now let's create a\nbox plot we will also use the coordinate\nfunction and that basically gives me\nbased on the data so i've changed the\ncoordinates now if you\nlook at the previous one where we\ncreated a plot we had mileage on the\ny-axis and cylinders\non the x-axis\nnow i did a coordinate flip and that's\nlike your transpose function so you have\ncreated the box plot but you have just\nflipped the coordinates you can create a\nbox plot and then say fill\nwhich is the factor of cylinder\nso that can be used to fill up the\nvalues in your box plot\nnow what we can also do is we can create\nfactors so we have learnt about factors\nearlier which is usually used to work on\ncategorical variables\nso here let's create a factor\nwhich is empty cars gear you have am you\nhave cylinder and if you look at the\nfactors which we have created we have\npassed our data\nwhat is the field or the column we are\ninterested in what is the level of\nvalues there and what are the labels for\nthose values right so we have learnt\nabout factors\nyou can always look into the previous\nsection and learn more about factors\nnow let's create a scatter plot by using\nthe ggplot function again we will use\nthe data as empty cars i will go for\nmapping option and then i will give my\naesthetics that is what would be x what\nwould be your y\nand you also would want to use what kind\nof\nfunction you are using so let's go for\ngeom pawn point and that basically helps\nme in creating a scatter plot now you\ncan create a scatter plot by factors\nso here we will say gg plot so notice in\nall of these cases depending on the kind\nof data you have\ndepending on the kind of plot you are\ninterested in you will use the gg plot\nand then basically a function with that\nor the inbuilt package so here i'm\nsaying data is empty cars i am going for\nmapping which basically will take the\nvalues for your x and y\nwhat is the color and the coloring will\nbe done based on the factor values now\nif you remember factors will obviously\nhave some levels and\nthose levels will basically help you in\ndifferentiating between your categorical\nvariables so i'm saying as dot factor on\ncylinder and then i'm using geom point\nto basically create the scatter plot so\nlet's do this\nand\ni can look at the values of this one so\nit says\nmust be there is an error which says\nmust at least one color from the hue\npalette so let's look at that one so the\nerror which we were facing when we gave\ncolor as the factor values was because\nwhen you look at these factors which\nwere created with some labels if we look\nat the values of these it tells me there\nare any values in that particular column\nsimilarly your gear or similarly you can\ncompletely look at the complete data set\nit tells me cylinder you have am you\nhave care now these have some\nwe have created some labels but these\nhave n a values so what we can do is we\ncan create a scatter plot as we did\nearlier by giving the aesthetics and\nthat's a simple scatter plot\nwherein i'm also using geom point so\nthat i can have these points by defaults\nor with defaults you can also\ngive a color specific basically if you\nwould want to have different kind of\ndata in the same plot or i can create\nscatter plots by different sizes by\ngiving a size or\ni can give a color and size and that's\nagain one way in which you can create\nyour scatter plots now let's also see\nhow you can visualize\none more data set which is mpg\nso i can also do it in this way where i\nset ggplot2\nand then pass and look at the data set\nwhat we have here\nyou can just do a view on this to see\nwhat my data contains if the fields have\nany any values if that's going to affect\nyour plotting so now what we can do is\nwe can create a bar plot or a bar chart\nso i'm saying gg plot the data would be\nas we have given in previous lines that\nis ggplot2 mpg then i will\nsay what should be in my aesthetics and\nwhat kind of\nchart are you going to create so i'm\nsaying geom underscore bar so that's my\nbar chart and that has basically your\nclass and count now you can create a\nstacked bar chart where your information\nis stacked\nin the same bars\nand we are still using the same data\nwe are going for aesthetics which is\nclass\nand then when you say geom bar which\ncreates your stack bar we will use fill\nwhich is drive\nand we can always go back and look at\nour data for example\nyou can always look into this so you\nhave the drive column here\nand you are also working on this\ncomplete data set so let's go ahead and\ncreate a stacked bar chart and that\nbasically gives me the information where\nyou have the drive information which is\nstacked\nhere now you can do a dodge\nby giving the position as dodge\nso we are still going to go for a stack\nchart but this time the bars will be\nnext to each other and that can also be\ndone which is very useful\nyou can use this by using geom point\nwhere you are mapping and you are\nspecifying what are your aesthetics so\nwe were creating a scatter plot now you\ncan also use\nor give more details where you can say\ncolor can be based on the class\nand we have different classes and based\non that my points have been colored\nnow you can also use a plot\nly or plotly library so let's install\nthis one\ni will say yes for example let it\nbasically restart so that all my\npackages are updated\nthen i can access that package using\nlibrary function\nand then\ncreate a variable to which you are\nassigning your plot underscore ly plot\nso data is empty cars what will be your\nx-axis what will be your y-axis and\ndetails on your marker which we have\ngiven\nwherein i will give a list which is size\ncolor which is a combination\nand then you have your line\nwhat kind of color it will have and what\nwill be the width so this is where i am\ngoing to use plot ly\nand let's look at this plot\nso it basically gives me some\ninformation now we see some warnings\nwhich are getting generated but there is\nyou don't need to worry about that so\nyou can look at the packages what you\nhave\nand what options you are using so\nsimilarly we can create one more plot\nusing plot ly and look at the values of\nthose so that's a plot with a trend\nwhich explains me about my data\nso this is a simple small tutorial on\nunderstanding or\nhow you can have your graphics or\nvisualization\nused to understand your data obviously\nthere are much more examples\nmuch more ways in which you can pass\ninto your plot functions\nor your gg plot\nand the inbuilt packages which are\navailable in r for your visualization\nnow that could be for\nexploratory data analysis or explanatory\ndata analysis so try these graphs and\nsee if\nyou can change these options and try or\ncreate new visualizations\ntoday we're going to study the matte\nplot library and the python code so\nwhat's in it for you what is matte plot\nlibrary types of plots plotting graphs\nand subgraphs adding a graph inside a\ngraph graph parameters title label\nlegend line graphs line types color and\ntransparency canvas grid and axis range\n2d plots scatter step bar fill between\nradar chart histogram contour image 3d\nsurface image and then we'll hit a\npractice example pie chart\nso let's start with what is matte plot\nlibrary map plot library is an open\nsource drawing library which supports\nrich drawing types it is used to draw 2d\nand 3d graphics\nand there are so many packages in the\nmatplot library we're going to cover the\nbasics and there are so many packages\nthat sit on top of the maplight library\nthat we can't even cover them all today\nbut we'll hit the main one so you have a\ngood understanding of what the matplot\nlibrary is and what the basics can do\nyou can understand your data easily by\nvisualizing it with the help of matplot\nlibrary you can generate plots\nhistograms bar charts and many other\ncharts with just a few lines of code and\nhere we have some basic types of plots\nyou can see here that we'll go into we\nhave the bar chart the histogram boy i\nuse a lot of histograms in my stuff\nscatter plot line chart pie chart and\narea graph\nlet's start plotting them and to do this\ni'm going to be using jupiter notebook\nyou can use any of your python\ninterfaces for programming or scripting\nand running it of course we here really\nlike the jupyter notebook for doing\nbasic a lot of basic stuff because it's\nso visual and in our jupyter notebook\nwhich opens up in this case i'm using\ngoogle chrome you can go up here to new\nand we'll create a new python 3 and set\nthat up\nif you're not familiar with jupyter\nnotebook we do have a tutorial that\ncovers some of the basics of that you'll\nlook at any of our tutorials i usually\ncover a number of them showing how to\nset up jupiter and anaconda i myself use\njupiter through anaconda in fact let's\ngo ahead and open that up and just take\na look at it see what that looks like\nyou can see your anaconda navigator if\nyou install it it will automatically\ninstall the jupiter notebook but that\nalso installs a lot of other things i\nknow some people like the qt console for\ndoing python or spyder i've never used\nthem i actually use notepad plus plus as\none of my editors and then i use the\njupiter notebook a lot because it's so\neasy to have a visual while i'm\nprogramming and even simple script in\npython i'll take it from the jupyter\nnotebook and then do a save as you can\nalways go under file and you can\ndownload as a python program so that\nwill download it as an actual python\nversus the ipython that this saves it as\nso let's go ahead and dive in and see we\ngot going here and let's go ahead and\nput matplot library tutorial and i'm\ngoing to turn this cell into a mark down\nso it doesn't actually run it\nyou can see it has a nice little title\nthere that's all jupiter notebook\nand then from matplot library\nlet's import\npi lab\nback one and then let's go ahead and\njust print\nwe'll go pi lab\nand the version let's go ahead and run\nthis so we're going to import our pi lab\nmodule from the matplot library and we\nfind out that we're in version 1.15.1\nalways important to note the version\nyou're in probably i was reading an\narticle that said the number one thing\nthat python programmers struggle with is\nremembering what version they're working\nin and making sure that they're going\nfrom one platform to the other with the\nsame version and if we're gonna graph\nthings i think we need some data to\ngraph so we're gonna import numpy as np\nnow if you're not familiar with numpy\ndefinitely go back and check out our\nnumpy tutorial there's so many different\nthings you can do with it dealing with\nreshaping the data and creating the data\nwe're just going to use it to create\nsome data for us\nand there is a lot of ways to create\ndata but we're going to use the np dot\nline space\nso we're going to create a numpy array\nand the way you read this\nis we're going to create numbers between\n0 and 10 and we're going to create 25 of\nthese numbers so we're just going to\ndivide that equally up between 0 and 10.\nand if we have x coordinates we should\nprobably have some y coordinates and\nwe'll do something simple like x times x\nplus 2. and let's just take a look we're\ngoing to print x\nand print y\nlet me go ahead and run this\nand let's see what we got going on here\nso we have our x coordinates which is 0\n0.4 0.83 etc and you can look at this as\nan xy plot so we have 0 we have 2. we\nhave 0.416 we have\n2.17 and just as a quick reminder we're\ngoing to do print np array x comma y dot\nreshape 25 comma 2. and the reason i\nwant to do this is i want to show you\nsomething here\na lot of times a program returns\nx comma y and it's an array of x comma y\nx comma y x comma y\nand so when you're working with the pi\nplot\nyou have to separate it out and reshape\nit so if i start off with pairs like\nthis i can reshape them if i know\nthere's 25 pairs in there i can switch\nthe 2 and the 25 and this is kind of\ngoofy but we'll do it anyways reshape so\ni'm going to reshape my 25 by 2 back to\n2 by 25\nand if i run that you'll see i end up\nwith the same output as the x y the two\ndifferent arrays in here\nand this is important that we want x and\ny separate\nagain that's all numpy stuff but it's\nimportant to understand that this is a\nformat that matplot library works with\nit works with an array of x's and they\nshould match your array of y's so each\none has 25 different entities in it\nand then for our basic plotting of this\ndata it only takes one command to draw\ngraph of this data and so we use our\nfrom up here where we imported pi lab we\ntake our pi lab and the key net under\nthere is plot for plotting a line and\nthen we want our x coordinates and our y\ncoordinates and we'll throw in r and the\nr simply means red so we're going to\ndraw the line in red let me go and run\nthat\nyou can actually switch this around if\nyou wanted to do different there's b\nfor blue we have a lot of fun yellow\nhard to see yellow there we go but we'll\ngo ahead and stick with red\nrun\nand when you're doing presentations with\nthese try to be consistent you know if\nthe business and the shareholders send\nyou a\nspreadsheet and they have losses in red\nuse red for losses in your graph\ntry to be consistent use green for\nprofit for money you don't have to\nnecessarily use green but it's whatever\nthey're using whatever the company is\nusing try to mirror that that way people\naren't going to be confused if you\nswitch your data around every time one\ngraph has red for loss and one graph has\nblue for loss it gets really confusing\nso make sure you're consistent in your\ngraphs and your coloring and something\nto know because we're going to cover\nthis in a minute this is your canvas\nsize so we have a canvas here and what\nwe're going to do next is we're going to\nlook at sub graphs okay\nso let's take our pi lab and create a\nsub plot\nand one of the things also to know when\nwe're working with the matplot library\ni'm not setting when i do this this is\nmy drawing canvas the pi lab so once\ni've imported the pi lab i'm drawing my\nimages on there very important to know\nand with the subplot we're going to give\nit some different values\nand we're going to represent by rows\ncolumns and indexes and let's do one two\none so it's going to be the first row\nsecond column and the index is like you\ncan stack your graphs and things like\nthat we don't worry too much about\nindexes but rows and columns we want to\ngo ahead and use row one and column two\nand if we're going to have one object we\nshould probably have two but before we\ndo that we have to plot data onto the\nsubplot so the order is very important\nand we're going to stick with our x\ncomma y\nand let's do this we're going to add in\na third parameter here remember we did\nred we're going to add shorthand dash\ndash for dashed lines so this plots the\ndata into row one column two\nand if we're going to do that let's do\nanother one\npilab.subplot and if we're going to do\nrow one let's do\ncolumn two and index two\nand this time we're gonna add g for\ngreen and this denotes a style and if\nwe're gonna set up our pi lab\nsubplot there we go\nlab we got to go ahead and plot that pi\nlab plot\nand instead of x y we want y comma x\noops i messed up this is in the wrong\nspot there we go we'll move that down\nhere real quick because that goes in the\nplot part so the subplot tells it the\nrow column and index and the pi plot\ntells it what data in this case we\nswitched them and the color and then the\nstyle shorthand now let's go ahead and\nrun that\nand you'll see it takes this canvas\nsplits it in two and now we have two\ndifferent graphs and we have the red one\nwith dashed lines and we have the green\none which is has little stars going up\nand if we take this and let's just um\njust for fun let's change this and run\nthat with an index of one it puts them\nboth on the same index and also gives me\na warning because it's a strange way of\ndoing two subplots there's depreciated\nthere's another way to do it but most\npeople just ignore that warning because\nit's not going to go away anytime soon\nnow that's using the same setup what\nhappens if we do\ninstead of\nthis let's change the column on here and\nfind out what happens\nand if we do the column\nit didn't really like that on the setup\nit just disappears so let's keep our\ncolumn as two and let's change the row\non the second one to two\nand run that\nand you'll see again it kind of squishes\neverything together and causes some\nissues so let's take the index so these\nneed a unique index and you can see here\nwhere i made some changes i said row 2\nand look what happens when i change to\ncolumn two so i now have row two column\ntwo index two i squished it up here so\nyou could put another graph underneath\nis what that does and there's all kinds\nof different things you really have to\njust play with these numbers till you\nget a handle on them because\nyou know we have to repeat it 164 times\naccording to cambridge university if\nit's completely new to you and you can\nsee right here where we go three\nrun there we go but you can see it takes\na little bit sometimes to play with\nthese and get the numbers right\nhopefully hit the wrong one that's why\nlet's go three there three there run\nthere we go now it's overlapping so i\nhave this doubled over here on the right\nfor now we'll just go ahead and leave\nthis with the\nwhere we have column and row two and the\ntwo different indexes so they appear\nnice and neatly side by side\nand then as we just saw as we were\nflashing through them we can put them on\ntop of each other\nand let me just highlight that and copy\nit down here\npaste it down there and here we have one\ntwo one and then we'll do one two one\nalso for this one and that puts the two\nsubplots directly on top of each other\ngives us that warning and you can see we\nnow have two different sets of data\ngraphed on top of each other\nand you can also see how it did the\nindexes since one of them is from 0 to\n10 that's the green one on the x axis\nand the other one is from 0 to 10 on the\ny axis so it took the greatest value of\neither one and then use those as a\nshared value\nso let's\nnext look at operator description and\nwe'll go ahead and turn this cell into a\nmarkdown and run that so it looks nice\nso fig and you remember i talked about\nthe canvas earlier i briefly mentioned\nit we're going to look a little bit more\nat the canvas later on but that's what\nthe figure is fid we're going to add\naxes so we're going to initialize the\nsubplot add the subplot\nin rows and columns and all kinds of\ndifferent things with this you can do\nlet's look at that code and see exactly\nwhat's going on and i want you to notice\nthat there's fig which is the actual\ncanvas in the matplot library and ax is\ncommonly used to refer to the subplots\nso we're creating subplots you'll see ax\nequals plt subplot\nearlier we did the pi lab so let's go\nahead and import pi plot from matplot\nlibrary and we're going to do it as plt\nyou'll see that a lot that's really the\nstandard in the industry is to call it\nplt just like pandas as pd and numpy\narray is np certainly you can import it\nas whatever you want but i would stick\nto the standards and we're going to do\nthe same graph as we did above\nwith the\npi lab but with the plt so if it looks\nfamiliar there's reason we're doing this\nbecause we want to show you how the\nfigure part works and working with the\ncanvas goes but we're going to do the\nsame plot as we did before and we'll\ncall it fig and we're going to set that\nequal to plot figure so there's our\nfigure or canvas on there and let's\ncreate a variable called axes and we're\ngoing to set that equal to fig dot add\naxes and in this we're going to control\nthe left right the width the height of\nthe canvas from 0 to 1.\nand so we can go ahead and i'm just\ngoing to put some stuff in there i got\n0.5 0.1 0.8 0.8 so when you're looking\nat this this is a zero to one or you\ncould say fifty percent ten percent\neighty eighty percent but it's a control\nit's going to control your left and your\nright along with the width and the\nheight so the width and the height we're\ngonna use eighty percent and we're gonna\nhave like a little indent on the left\nand the right and this should look\nfamiliar from above x us dot plot\nx comma y\nand then let's give it a color how about\nred since we're recreating the same\ngraph let's keep it uniform oops and it\nhelps if i use a axis instead of ax es i\ndon't know where that came from but this\nlooks identical to the one we had up\nabove so here's our axis plot x comma y\nof red\nsame graph same setup but this time\nwe've added a variable equal to the\nfigure dot add axes so our plot figures\nare canvas our axes is what we're\nworking in and then our axis.plot x\ncomma y\nand again we can draw sub graphs let me\nput that down here\n[Music]\njust like we did before and a little\ndifferent temptation here we're going to\nfig comma\naxes equal\nplt.subplots\nand in here it's going to be the number\nof rows\nwe're going to do one row\nand columns equals two so if you\nremember before this that we did we had\none row with two different graphs on it\nwe're going to do the same thing but\nknow how we did this here's our figure\nour canvas and our axes we're going to\ncreate actually two different axes we're\ngoing to create row 1 column 2. and so\naxis is an array of information so we\ncan simply do\n4\nlet's do x in axes\nthis will look familiar x dot plot we're\ngoing to do x comma y we'll go ahead and\nmake a red keep everything looking the\nsame remember nice uniform graphs\neverything looks the same and if we go\nahead and run this\nyou'll see we get two nice side-by-side\ngraphs so just as we had before the same\nlook the same setup\nand just for fun let's change in columns\nto three we'll run that and now you see\nwe'll have three on there and let's see\nif we make it a little bit more\ninteresting we'll do in rows equals to\n2. and you can see down here we're going\nto get an attribute error because it's\ntrying to scrunch everything together\nso it does have a limit how much stuff\nyou can put in one small space that's\nimportant to know you can fix that by\nchanging the canvas size which we'll\nlook at in just a minute and there's\nother ways to change it on here but here\nwe go we can do in rows two and columns\nequals one you can see two nice images\nright above each other we'll go back to\nthe original one row two columns side by\nside left to right and\nwe can also\ndraw a picture\nor graph\ninside another graph\nand that's kind of a fun thing to do\nit's important to note that we can layer\nour stuff on top of each other which\nmakes for a really nice presentation\nso let's start by uh fig let's create\nanother figure so we're going to start\nover again with our canvas\nwe set that equal to plt.figure\nso there's our new canvas and let's do\naxes we'll call it axes one and two axes\none equals fig dot add axes remember\nthis from earlier\nand\nthis here similar numbers we used before\nsaying how big this axis is this figure\nin the axis is so this is going to be\nthe big\naxes and let's do axes 2 equals\nanother figure add axes and then\n0.2.5.4.3\nand if we're going to do this they need\ndata on them so let's go ahead and plot\nsome data on our axes so axes1 dot plot\nand we'll make this simply x comma y\ncomma make it red\nand then let's go axes two dot plot and\nlet's reverse them y comma x comma green\nthere we go doing what i told you not to\ndo you shouldn't be swapping axes around\nand plotting your data in five different\ndirections because it's confusing let's\ngo ahead and run this and see what this\nlooks like and then let's talk a little\nbit about this we talked about the 0.2.5\nand let me just grab the annotation for\nthat that's left right width and height\nso we have in here that this is going to\nbe left right so here's our left is\npoint one in point five and we you know\nwhat let's just play with this a little\nbit what happens when i change this to\n0.1 moves it way over to the left so\nthere's our 0.1 so we can make this\npoint 4. run that there we go so you can\nsee how you can move it around the\nbranches on here 0.2 0.5 is the\nleft so that's our right so see what\nhappens when we do point oh let's make\nthis point one and that actually is they\nhad it down at left right i thought this\nwas wrong it's actually how far from the\nbottom let me switch that on here bottom\nthere we go so we had here on this we\ncan go ahead and put that back to 0.5\nand run that and this is point three\nlet's make this point three also and\nthat is the width and then of course\nthere's the height we can make that\nreally tight actually let's do 0.2 and\nlet's run that and you can see it\nchanges the height on there we make it\neven smaller 0.2 by 0.2 and as you can\nsee you can get stuck playing with this\nto make it look just right it can\nsometimes take a little bit certainly\nonce you have the settings if you're\ndoing a presentation you try to keep it\nuniform unless it doesn't make sense for\nthe graph you're working on try to keep\nthe same colors the same position and\nthe same look and feel\nand i mentioned earlier we can adjust\nthe canvas size so this is from earlier\ni just copied it down below we're going\nto replot the same data we've been\nlooking at and what we can do is we can\nchange the figure size to 16 by nine let\nme run that and show you what that looks\nlike so it fills the whole screen and\nthen if you are normally when you're\nworking on the screen you don't worry\ntoo much about this but we can set the\ndpi to 300\nrun that\nthere it goes this is your dots per inch\nand if you are doing an output of this\nand you're printing a hard copy you want\nthe higher quality i would suggest\nnothing under 300 if it's a professional\nprint you might get a little less than\nthat but whenever i'm doing professional\ngraphics and printing them out on\nsomething 300 dots per inch is kind of\nthe minimal on there you can go a lot\nhigher too but keep in mind the higher\nyou get the more memory it takes and the\nmore lag time and the more resources you\nuse so usually 300 is a good\nsolid number to use your dots per inch\nand you can see it drills a nice it\ndraws a nice large canvas here which is\n16 by nine and then the dpi is 300 on\nhere it's a little higher quality and\njust out of curiosity i wonder how long\nit takes to draw something double that\nsize 600 and you can see here where at\n600 dpi it's going to take a while there\nit goes just because it's utilizing a\nlot more graphics on there and let me\njust go back to the 300 now we'll\nactually do let's do a 100 you're not\ngoing to see a difference on this\nbecause it is web based graphics are\npretty low\nand up here you saw i did this with the\nplot figure this works the same if i do\nfigure axes subplot figure size and then\nwe'll go ahead and do axes\nplot\nx comma y comma we'll stick to red\nlet's go ahead and run this and you\nshould get almost the same thing here\nhere's our\naxis on the subplot on here with the\nfixed size and the dpi let me take this\nall out let me just remove all that real\nquick run it again there we go now we're\nback to our original figure and let's\nlook at some of the other things you can\ndo with this\none things we do is we can set a title\nfor the axis so axis set title you'll\nsee right here since i put this on the\naxis it's the main title for the whole\ngraph\nand if you're going to have a title you\nshould also label so we can label our x\nlabel and we can set our y label in this\ncase we're just going to call it x and y\nkeep it nice and uniform and if we run\nthis you'll see that we've added a nice\nx label and y label whoops where'd they\ngo and it turns out in this environment\nthat you have to put it before the title\nso let me go ahead and put it before the\ntitle and there's our x y and then we\nrun that and of course we can also do\nupper size a little bit so you can see\nwhat's going on a little better so here\nwe have x label x if you come down here\nyou'll see our x label and our y label\nwe can of course change this to x\nlabel you can change this to y\nbe whatever you want on here of course\nand our title graph there we go run so\nhere we have our title graph our y label\nand our x label all set up on our nice\nlittle plot and then before we move on\nto the next section let's do one more\nthing on here we have a thing called the\nlegend and we're gonna do we're gonna\nset our ax legend label one label two up\nhere it's a format for it but let's go\ndown here and actually use it i'm going\nto do two different plots we're going to\nhave axes plot x by x times x squared\nand x cubed and if i run this you'll see\nit puts two nice graphs on the setup on\nthere but it's nice to have a legend\ntelling you what's going on so for the\nlegend we can actually do axes since we\nhave the two plots legend and on here\nwe've created an array\nand we have y equals x squared y equals\nx cubed you can actually put this as\nwhatever you want those are just strings\nand then location two and let's go ahead\nand run this and see what that looks\nlike and you can see it puts a nice\nlegend on the upper left hand corner\nlocation two we can do location three\nand run it and it drops it down to the\nbottom location one i can't remember\nwhere that's at there we go upper right\nso each one of these is a number that\nrefers to the different locations on the\nscreen zero kind of have to play with\nthem or look them up to remember where\nthey're at but they do work it just kind\nof moves around depending on where you\nwant your legend out on there so on this\nsection we cover the title of the graph\nthe y labels and legends this is we're\ngetting into some starting to look\nreally fancy here so we now have\nsomething we can actually put out you'll\nsee the title the graph looks a little\nfuzzy so i might in a web setup put the\ndpi up a couple notches maybe put it at\n200 100 might work fine just so you know\nsomething to notice on here when you're\nplaying with these different things we\nhad our subplots dpi equals oh let's do\n200 to see what that looks like\nso you can see it now is a lot clearer\nit's also larger so it's a nice little\nfeature you can throw in there with your\ndpi dots per inch\nso the next section is let's look at\nsome graph features we're going to look\nat line color transparency size and a\nfew more things on here and oops i\nforgot the main title so we have our\nfigure in our axis equals our plot and\nsubplots and i'm going to do a dpi\nequals 150 so the graph comes out nice\nand large and easy for you to see\nand let's go ahead and do three plots on\nhere we'll do x by x plus once which is\ngoing to be a straight line plot\nx plus x plus 2\nand axis dot plot\nx x\nplus 3. this looks like we're doing\nnearest neighbor setup we're showing how\nit\nlocated data putting your lines on there\nbetween the nearest neighbors there we\ngo so it draws a nice little graph with\nthree lines on it one of the things we\ncan do is we can control the alpha on\nthis oops and you can actually see the\nwhen they did these lines it\nautomatically pulls in different colors\nfor your setup so there's some automatic\nautomatic things going on in there and a\nlot of times we do that comma r where\nwe're going to do color equals red\nanother notation on here let's go ahead\nand run this now we have a bright red\nline down there and with the matte plot\nlibrary you're not limited to red you\ncan also use the one of many different\ncolor references as you see here with\nthe pound sign one one five five dd\nwhich just is just blue and we can do\nthe same thing with another color on\nhere which it turns out to be green i\ncan just as easily do this green\nblue oops there we go blue and run that\nand you'll see here we have red blue and\ngreen and what i want to do is i want to\nmake this we're going to say what's\ncalled the alpha on this and we're going\nto set this equal to 0.5 so this is\nhalfway see-through when i run this and\nit's almost going to look pink because\nyou can see through it and let's change\nthis just a little bit just to make this\nkind of fun let's square it there we go\nrun it so now we have this nice square\nthat comes up and you can see when it\ncrosses it because i plotted these two\nlines after it and they have no alpha\nthe red is behind those lines or in this\ncase pink because we did the alpha\nhalfway through so let's go ahead and do\nthis alpha equals 0.5 and oh you know\nwhat instead of squaring it let's take\nit to the 0.5 power that'll be kind of\ninteresting to see what that does we'll\njust go to keep it squared there we go\nand run that and let's go back and look\nat this where it crosses over and the\nfirst thing you see right here is on the\nblue it's kind of light blue now you can\nsee how the two colors add together you\nget almost a purple on there so i can\nclearly see where the red crosses the\nblue line and then the green just blanks\nit over because i didn't do any\nopaqueness no alpha on there\nso this is great if you have lots of\ndata that crosses over and you need to\nbe able to track those lines better and\nwe'll go ahead and do this 0.5 and we'll\nrun that oops i did\nequals 0.5 let me go ahead and run that\nand so you can see right here now you\ncan easily see the red line how it\ncrosses the green and the blue down here\nand if we want to we can do this as the\ndefault is one solid so we can change\nthis all to point eight let me just do\nthat\noops fifty eight eight there we go\nrun\noops i must hit a wrong button there let\nme try that again i actually get rid of\na bracket and let's go ahead and run\nthat\nand we come down here and look at this\nyou can still see where it passes behind\nthem but the green dominates and the\nblue dominates because we're now at\neighty percent instead of fifty percent\nwhen you can do less that's kind of fun\nalthough at some point the lanes kind of\nfade\nso 0.5 is usually the best setting on\nthere we have a nice pastel here at 0.3\nand you can easily see where they cross\nover and just like you can play with the\ncolors we can play with line width and\nyou know let's do\nlet's try dpi 100 and see what that\nlooks like on my screen equals 100 and\nwe'll go ahead and just take our ax plot\nlet's do four of these lines just you\ncan see how they look next to each other\nreal quick here there we go\nif i run this they should all appear the\nsame it automatically does different\ncolors on there so let's do color equals\nblue\ni forgot my quotation marks there we go\nand we'll go ahead and just make these\nall blue just for purposes of being nice\nand uniform and then what i want to do\nis i want to do the line\nwidth\nwidth\nequals\n0.25\nand let's just copy and paste that down\nhere\nlet's do equals one\nabout 1.5 and let's do one let's make\nthis equal to 2. let's see what that\nlooks like and we do that you can see it\ngoes from a very thin line a 0.5 a 1 our\n1.5 and 2 which is twice the width of\nthe one and if we're going to do\ndifferent sizes we had different colors\nwe had our alpha scheme let's take this\nwhole thing here\nlet's paste it down here and do another\none\nbut instead of line width\nlet's look at styles and something to\nknow here you can actually abbreviate\nthis with lw so line width can also be\npoint let's just do everything point two\nand let's set up a line style we'll do\nthe first one dashes and let me just\npaste that down here\nso i'm not doing a lot of extra typing\nthere we go\ntake this out so we have our dashed\nwe can do a dash dot we'll just do the\ndash dot here and a colon here there we\ngo and there's a lot of different\noptions we'll look at a few more as we\ngo down for different ways of\nhighlighting data\nbut when you look at this we have\neverything is a line width of two and\nnow we have a straight line we have a\ndashed line or a dot dash and a dot dot\ndot line\nand then another thing we can add on\nhere is we're going to do here's our ax\nplot and we did x let's do x plus um 4.\nso it goes right on the top and do color\nblack line width 1.5 so it's a smaller\nline and we're going to take the line\nand we're going to set dashes so look\ni've changed some of the notation here\nfor my line and my ax plot so i can set\nmy line comma equal to x plot and then i\ncan change the line settings this way\nand when i run this let me run that on\nhere you'll see the 5 10 15 10\ncreates a series of dashes\nthat are buried in link\nlink in this case they alternate between\na short dash and a long dash we can play\nwith these numbers curiosity always has\nme what happens when you play with the\nnumbers just to see what they look like\nlet's do this let's paste this down here\ni'll do two of these just because\nthey're kind of fun to play with and\nlet's change this from 10 to\n3 and we're going to change this one\nfrom 15\nto\n4. and let's run that\nand you can see the differences in the\nlines oops very a little bit confusing\non there because i forgot to change the\nlines are all on top of each other so\nlet me change that really quick here and\nlet's run that and now you can see\nhere's our original dashed line\nalternating when i change these numbers\non the second one the very end value to\nthree you can see now we have dashes of\nfive let's see i'm gonna guess this is a\ndash is a five skip ten dashes of\nfifteen skip three and then it goes back\nto the beginning dash is five dashes\nskip ten fifteen dashes skip three and\nof course the last one we just switched\nup a little bit it looks a lot more\nuniform because i'm using two sets of\nten or if i did something like this and\nchange it to 30 it really becomes\npronounced as far as the distances\nbetween them and instead of four let's\ngo oh let's put 30 here also 30 by 30\nthere we go really pronounced on that\none and let's look at one more important\ngroup for plotting our data and in this\nwe're gonna here's our plot we started\nwith with the x plus one x plus two x\nplus three and did it in blue on this\none's three or four different blue lines\nand this property we want to add the\nactual plots so you can see where the\nplots are on the graph and for that we\nmight have marker equals o and if we run\nthis you'll see it puts a dot for each\nof these and there's 25 dots because we\nhave 25 x values so we actually have\nzero and each of the different values of\nx y are then plotted here with the dots\nand we don't want to just limit\nourselves to dots\nyou can also do\nplus sign that's another option dots is\nmost common i'll actually like the dots\nthe best if we do the plus sign you see\nit puts a nice crosshairs or plus sign\non there and we can do a marker there's\na number of different markers you can\nuse\nand i think this one was it s is another\none\nwhich is a nice square and that's\nactually a good one s for square o for\nperiod okay that's just kind of weird so\nyou can see that probably on these\nmarkers another one is the number one so\nif we run that you'll see we now have\nthese little hatch marks\nand let's take oh let's just go with the\no on this one\nby the way this works with square really\nnicely some stuff we're going to do here\non just a second let's do\nmarker\nsize equals two and\nchange that to five and run that and you\ncan see here it puts a nice little tiny\ndot versus uh this size dot here this is\ninteresting because it said two i\nthought it would be bigger\nbut if you do 0.5 it gets even smaller\nand let's just do 10 to see what that\nlooks like run that looks huge so marker\nsize a lot of these are dependent on the\ndpi and the setups there's things that\nswitch around as far as the way the size\nshows up you got to be a little careful\nwhen you change one setting it can\nchange all the other markers and then\nlet's take our square on here\nand we'll do we have marker size so we\nalso have marker face we'll set that\nequal to red of course i mean change the\nso it's up one notch we'll run that\nwhoops must have mistyped something on\nhere and i did it's marker face color\nequals red and so when i run that you\ncan now see i have the squares on there\nwith the marker face color of course we\ncan mix and match these\ncome down here and we'll make this\ninstead of let's make this plus seven\nand we'll make this\nsize 15\nmarker face color\nequals\nand we'll do what green just because\nthere we go run very hard to actually\nsee what's going on there still 25 dots\nthey kind of overlap as you can see they\nprint them over each other of course if\nwe really wanted to make it look\nhorrible we could just make that really\nhuge\ngenerally though you want something a\nlittle bit smaller and cuter we'll just\ntry doing it this way there we go that's\ntoo small to even see the face so four\nyou can start to see the face on there\naround four and maybe an eight eight\nmight be a good number for this there we\ngo eight again that all just depends on\nwhat you're trying to show and display\nso we've covered a lot of stuff here as\nfar as our lines we've covered\nopaque with our alpha setting on there\ngive us some nice pastels you can see\nhow they overlap and how they cross over\nwe covered the line width different size\non there different formats for the line\nitself and these are all you can combine\nall these so you can have our line width\nequals two line style equals dash you\ncan bring this down here also to the\nmarkers and then we added markers in\njust entered a circle a\nplus sign the square a little tick which\nuses a one then we had a marker size and\na marker color face and we combine those\nyou see we get a nice different series\nof representations we also briefly\nmentioned color where you didn't have to\nuse like in here we use color black\nsomeplace up here and have to find it we\nuse the actual number for the color as\nopposed to i changed them to red and\nblue so you get very precise on the\ncolor if you have a very specific color\nset that you need to match your website\nor whatever you're working on all those\nare tools in the matplot library so we\nhave\none more piece to formatting the graph\nso we want to show you and then we have\ntwo big sections we're going to go over\nthe different graphs that they have\nalong with a challenge problem so let's\ngo to the last section we're going to\nlook at is limits we're going to limit\nour data\nso this first primer is going to paste\nin there we're going to create our\nsubplots one two so one row two columns\nwe're gonna do a figure size of ten\ncomma 5. this should all look familiar\nnow since we've done a number of them\nand we're going to go ahead and plot and\nthis is an interesting notation you\nshould notice here our axis zero so one\nwe've used instead of you can just\niterate through them but they're just an\narray so it's an array of zero is still\nthe axes of the first axes out of two\nand we're going to plot x\nx squared\nx x cubed lined with two so we're gonna\ngo ahead and just plot two graphs right\non top of each other without doing\nmultiple plots on here and we'll set the\ngrid equal to true one here let's go\nahead and run that and you can see here\nour two plots with the x value going\nacross\nand i'm going to do something similar\nand by the way as you can just if you\nlook at it you can see the grid on there\nthat's all that is\neasier to spot the data going across\nwe're going to take the same\ndata for axes one so we have our plot of\nx x squared x and x cubed line with two\nand this time we're going to take our\naxes one and do y limit\nit's actually set underscore y limit\nthis is the y axis so it's going to be\nan array of two two values and we'll do\n0 comma\n60 i'm just making these numbers up the\nguys in the back actually made them up\ni'm just using their numbers\nwe're going to set the x limit\nand we'll set the x limit as\ndon't forget our brackets there\n2 comma five\nso it's the same data going in and but\nwe're setting a limit on it let's go\nahead and run that and let's see what it\ncomes out of and here we have the y\nlimit zero to sixty so we're looking at\njust the lower part of this curve here\nup to here and we have the x limit two\nto five so that starts right here at two\nand you can see very different graphs\nthis is kind of nice because you could\nactually put one of these on top of the\nother if you wanted to draw focus to one\npart of a graph remember how we did that\nearlier one inside the other but just a\nquick note you can easily limit your\ngraph and re-kind of reshape the way it\nlooks quite easily and we can also add\nthat grid down there if you want a grid\nwe'll run that and add the grid in there\noops i guess you have to do the grid\nbeforehand\nswitch that there we go sometimes the\norder on this is really important so you\nmay double check your order when you're\nprinting these things out it also helps\nif i change it to one so in this case it\nmight not be the order i wonder if i'll\ngo back here as one there we go so\ndoesn't matter the order and grid but\nyou can set the grid for easy viewing\nhere nice setup on there but you can see\nhow we can limit the data\nso let's start looking at some other 2d\ngraphs and make this cell a markdown so\nwe run it as a nice pretty title to it\nand let's go ahead and create some data\nwith an np array we'll do\nzero to five on here there we go and\nlet's look at four common graphs we'll\nput them side by side so we'll do a\nfigure our axes equals plot subplots one\nfour columns and then figure size\nhopefully it'll fit nicely on here it\nseems to do pretty good on here and i'll\ngo and just run that since we're in\nthere run you'll see i have my four\nblank plots on here\nand we'll start with axes of zero let's\nset title\nand we want this to be a scatter plot\na scatter plot just means it has a bunch\nof dots on it so here's our axes of zero\ndot scatter easy to remember scatter a\nbunch of plots on there we'll do our\nn or we can do x or n there we go and\nlet's go ahead and do axes set title\nscatter already did that we're just\ngoing to do scatter\nthat's how you do it on there notice how\nyou create a scatter plot with simply\nwith the scatter control and we'll do\nlet's do the variable x\nx\nplus let's throw some randomness in here\nusually scatter plots are i have a lot\nof random numbers connected to them\nthat's why they do them on there and so\nthe bigger the x gets the bigger the\nrandomness so 0.25 times the randomness\nand what we should end up doing here is\nwith the scatter plot and you can see as\nyou go up it just kind of has some\nrandom numbers and moves up and down the\nline\nbut plus just the points so if you\nremember from back up here where we did\nmarker\nthis is plotting basically just the\nmarker so it's a scatter plot\nprobably less used is a step plot so for\nexes one we'll go ahead and do a step\nplot so you can see what that looks like\nand this time we'll use our n value\ninstead of x we generated that end value\nup here and so for this we have n\nn times two r n squared n times two n\nsquared line width equals two and if we\nrun that it creates a nice step up\nlet's see so we've got a scatter plot\nwe've got a steps plot let's do a bar\nplot\nand we'll use the same formula in n\nsquared alignment centered because you\ncan have them left or right with 0.5 and\nalpha if you remember correctly that's\nhow opaque it is let's see what that\nlooks like on there\nso we have some nice you can see here a\nnice bar plot it should look very\nsimilar to the step plot but colored in\nand we can change the width let's see\nwhat happens we do 0.9 run\nand if we take width out completely\nrun that you can see it starts coming\ntogether on there now we can change the\nalpha we can take the alpha out too and\nrun that so now you have the solid\ncolors and if we take out the center\nand run that everything you really can't\nsee the shift on here because that's\nactually the default on this but these\nare common settings for the bar graph\nlet me just put them back in there there\nwe go alignment center and alpha now i\ncan't say i've used the step craft very\nmuch there's certain other certain i\nguess domains of expertise require a\nstep graph but the scatter plot and the\nbar graph very common especially the bar\ngraph and we'll look at histograms here\nin just a minute so i use histograms a\nlot especially in data science but this\nis nice if you have very concrete\nobjects somebody how many people wearing\nyellow hats that kind of thing but if\nwe're going to do that let's go ahead\nand do the last one which i see a lot\nmore in the sciences certainly using the\ndata science but more like for mapping i\nsaw publication on uh solar flares and\nthey were discussing the energy and so\nfilling in the graph gives it a very\ndifferent look so we're going to do the\nfill between\nand it's just like you think it'd be\nit's fill between but with a underscore\nbetween them and we'll do x and x\nsquared and x and x cubed and we'll do\ncolor green and alpha again just in case\nyou had other data you want to plot on\nthere you can see it forms a nice\nsquared coming up here and also if you\nlook at the bottom one is your squared\nvalue the upper line is your cubed value\nand then it fills in everything in\nbetween\nif you remember from calculus this would\nbe if you had like a car a motor and\nefficiency they would talk about the\nefficiency going up and the loss and\nyou're looking for the space or the area\nbetween the two lines so it gives you a\nnice visual of that now let's look at a\nfew more basic two dimensionals so we\nhave our figure figure size on here\nwe're going to do a radar chart to be\nhonest i've never used a radar chart in\nbusiness or in data science i can't find\na reason to use one now so the first\nline for doing a radar chart we have to\nadd axes and it's a figure and with this\nthis actually creates our\noh let's let's run it so you can see\nwhat it creates it creates a nice looks\nlike you're on a submarine and you're\ntracking the hunt for red october or\nsomething like that and it needs all of\nthese the polar is the fact that we're\ndoing polar coordinates\nzero zero point six point six has to do\nwith the size if you take out any of\nthese things and run them you get just a\nbox if you take out the other half you\npretty much get nothing in there and if\nyou change these numbers and change them\na little bit you can see it gets bigger\nthey had 0.6 on here i'll go ahead and\nleave it as one because that's just kind\nof fun that's all about the size on here\nthe height and the width and then let's\ncreate some data t equals np line space\nand this is 0 to 2 times np times pi so\nif you remember that is the\ndistance across and we're going to\ngenerate 100 points\nso this is just the thing of data we're\nputting together then we simply do an ax\ndot plot and in this case let's do t\ncomma t\nwhich would be a diagonal line on a\nregular chart and we'll give it a nice\ncolor equals blue\nand line width equals three let's see\nwhat that looks like and we can see here\na spiral coming out remember this would\nbe just a diagonal line on a regular\nchart what happens if we take this and\ninstead of t\ntimes 0.5 there we go\nand you can see it slightly alters the\nway it spirals out we can do t times two\nspirals out a little quicker so it's\nkind of just a fun i've like i said i've\nnever used a\nradar chart it's a column but you can\nalways think of radar submarine kind of\nlooks like one of those or in an\nairplane\nand none of this would be complete if we\ndidn't discuss histograms oh my gosh do\ni use a histogram so much\nand we'll use our numpy that we have set\nas np to generate oh looks like we have\na hundred thousand variables we're going\nto set equal to n and of course we\ncreate our figure and our axes from\nsubplots 1 2 figure size 12 14. so we're\ngoing to look at two different\nvariations of the histogram and we'll\nset a title default histogram set our\ntitle there\nand then this is simply\nhist for histogram and we'll just go\nahead and put in our n in there and let\nme run this and see what that looks like\nand let's talk about what is going on\nhere so we generated an array here of\ndata one thousand random arrays it looks\nlike they're mostly between minus four\nand four\nand then it adds up each one it says\nzero you have thirty five thousand that\nare zero so that's what's most common on\nhere and we have 20 000 that are\nsomewhere in this range right here\nbetween the minus two and well it looks\nlike one minus two and somewhere between\nzero and one there's thirty thousand\nnumbers so all this is saying is this is\nhow common these variables are and this\ngives you this point in so many\ndirections when you're looking at data\nscience to go ahead and run your\nhistogram so you should always have your\nhistogram and you can always put limits\nand all the other different things on\nyour array just like you did on the\nother graphs on there and then we're\ngoing to do a cumulative detailed\nhistogram\nand all it is is a histogram let me just\ndo that\nand we set cumulative equal to true\nand bins equal 50. and i really want to\nhighlight the um the cumulative equals\ntrue is important but we can now choose\nhow many bins we have in the first one\nit kind of selected them for us in this\ncase let me go ahead and run this and\nyou'll see it has that prints the data\nout for us and here's our whoops\nmust have missed oh there we go it\ndoesn't help that i put it over the old\none there we go okay\nso now you have your default histogram\nand then we have a cumulative histogram\nand we should have 50 steps in there and\nlet's just find out if that's true not\nso much by counting them i'm not going\nto count them if you want to you can\ncount them let's just change it to 10\nand see what happens and we see here we\nhave now 10 counts of that\nand we could set that for 5.\nand run that\nand then we have our 5 on there and we\ngo ahead and take the cumulative equals\ntrue out just so you can see what that\nlooks like and let me run that on here\ntoo\nthat looks just like it did before i\nthink there's what one two three four\nfive six seven eight they have eight\ndifferent bins on here is what the\ndefault came out of\nput that back in there run\nand so now it should look almost\nidentical and it does and then we can\nput the cumulative back in see what that\nlooks like with the cumulative\nand run that\nand we can see how that shifts\neverything over and has a slightly\ndifferent luck\nwait it shifts at all to the right no it\ndoesn't actually shift it to the right\nit's cumulative so it's the total of the\ndifferent occurrences and so what that\nmeans is like if you consider this like\nfor the year of rainfall we have like\nday one you had a little bit of rain day\ntwo we have more rain and so if you look\nat the number this is a hundred thousand\nthirty five thousand so it's\naccumulative detail the histogram of the\ncurrents as it grows and rainfall is a\ngood one because that would be a\ncumulative histogram of how much rain\noccurred throughout the year and we're\ngoing to look at two more graphs we've\nalready looked at a bunch of them we\nlooked at our radar graph we've looked\nat scatter step bar fill in\nbasic plots we've looked at different\nways of showing the data and we can\nincrease the size of the line the look\nthe color the alpha setting so let's\nlook at contour maps let's put that in\nthere there we go draw a contour map and\nbefore we draw a contour map\nwe need to go ahead and create data for\nit and if you have contours your data is\nall going to have three different values\nso let's go ahead and create the data\nhere we have our you'd import your\nmatplot library your numpy so we have\nour numbers array\nand we'll import matplot.cm\nand that's your color maps so you have\nall these different color maps you can\nlook at there's like hundreds of color\nmaps so if you don't want to do your own\ncolor you can even do your own color map\nthey're pretty diverse and of course our\nplt we're going to our pi plot and to\ngenerate our different data we're going\nto create a delta\n0.025 and we'll start with x when we're\ngoing to create an array between -3 and\n3 and delta increments of 0.025\nand we'll have our y we'll do something\nsimilar and then we'll create our x y\ninto a mesh grid again these are all\nnumpy commands so if you're not familiar\nwith these you'll want to go back and\nreview our numpy tutorial and we'll do\nan exponential on here minus x squared\nminus y squared for z1 we'll do a z2 so\nwe have two different areas and z equals\nz1 minus z2 times two\nso we've created a number of values here\nand let me go ahead and run this and\nlet's plug that in so you can see where\nthose values are going so once we've set\nthese we're going to create our figure\nand our x from our plt subplots we're\ngoing to create the variable cs and this\nis going to be our contour so right here\ncs is our contour surface and we're\nfeeding it x y and z if you remember x y\nwe created as our x and y components\nusing our mesh grid and you know what\nlet's do this just because it's kind of\ngood to see this let's go ahead and\nprint\nx\nand let's print\ny and i always like to do this when i'm\nworking with something that's either is\nreally complicated in this case is what\nwe're looking at or you don't understand\nyet so we've created a mesh grid we have\nx y and when we're done with this we end\nup with here's our x and this set of\nvalues and our y so there's our x and y\ncoordinates and then we've also created\nz based on our x and y so we have x\ncapital x capital y and capital z is our\nthree components\nx and y being the coordinates well z is\ngoing to be our actual height since\nwe're doing a contour map so we created\nour contour map from our x y and z\ncoordinates we want to go ahead and put\nin a c label maybe we want to go ahead\nand do a title on here\nwe'll put that in our set title and this\nis a\ncontour there we go contour map\nand let's go ahead and run this and see\nwhat that looks like\nand you'll see we generated a nice\nlittle contour map there's different\nsettings you can play with on this but\nyou can picture this being you're on a\nmountain climb and here we have a line\nthat's represent zero maybe that's sea\nlevel and then moving on up you have\nyour contours of 0.5 and then -1 and\ndifferent setups little hills i guess if\nit's minus that's like a pit so i guess\nyou're going down into a pit at minus\nfive and minus one but on the other side\nyou can see you're going up in levels so\nhere's a mountaintop and here's like a\nbasin of some kind and in data science\nthis could represent a lot of things\nthis could also be representing two\ndifferent values and maybe profits and\nloss i don't know if i'd ever really do\nthat as a contour map but i'm sure you\ncan be creative and find something fun\nto do with a contour map and then we're\ngoing to look at one last map which is\nthe 3d map and those are can be really\nimportant as a final product because\nthey can show so much additional\ninformation that you can't fit on two\ndimensional graphs\nthere we go draw a 3d image and so we're\ngoing to import from our mpl toolkits\nthe implant 3d and the axis 3d we're\ngoing to import axis 3d this is what's\ngoing to let us work with the 3d image\nand this should look familiar we're\ngoing to create another figure just like\nwe did before figure size 14 by six\nthat's a good fit on the screen we'll go\nahead and run that\nso we have our figure and let's go ahead\nand take our x and we're going to set\nthat equal to fig dot add subplot that\nshould also be familiar from earlier\nand we're going to work with this sets\nthe settings for the projection we're\ngoing to use one two one projection 3d\nand we'll see what that looks like in\njust a minute and we just created some\nthree-dimensional data here before\nwhere we had x y and z capital x y and z\nso we're going to reuse that data we're\njust going to use that since it's also\nthis is also a three-dimensional image\nso let's use that for a\nthree-dimensional graph and we simply do\nax plot underscore\nsurface and our capital x\ncapital y capital z so there's our data\ncoming in and we're going to add some\nsettings in here we're going to do r\nstride 4 c stride 4 and line with 0.\ni'll show you what that is here in just\na minute let's go ahead and run that so\nwe can see our graph\nand of course it helps if i don't add an\nextra comma in there and you can see it\ngenerates this really beautiful\nthree-dimensional graph\nso let's take a little bit time to\nexplore some of these numbers we have\ngoing in here\nwe have the r stride 4 the c stride 4\nand the projection 3d projection 3d is\nthe important one because that's telling\nus that this is a 3d graph here so what\nare these first numbers one two one\nlet's just change one of these i'm going\nto change this to five\nand it's going to give me an error let's\nchange it to one\nand that didn't work let's change this\nmiddle one to three instead and you're\ngoing to see how it starts reshaping the\nsize and how it fits on the screen\nand we'll change the first one to two\nwe'll run that one\nand again it's changed the dimensions\nand the size and how it fits on here\nplay with these numbers to get a nice\nlook and feel for it part of it is the\ntilt and the angle\ni'll do seven on this one\nthere we go you can see it really\nshifted it there\nbut again that changes the size now fits\non the canvas\nbut we'll leave it at the one\ntwo and just so you get a good look at\nwhat we're talking about here this is\ncolumn width and index from before\nif we do one one one you can see that it\nnow spreads it out all the way across\nuses the whole setup on there so this\nhas to do with the size and how big you\nwant it to be now there's one term that\nwe didn't cover in this yet but we've\nused it throughout the whole setup\nand i'm just going to type that down\nhere even though we're not going to go\ninto detail and that's the term heat\nmap you might see that it's kind of\nstarting to lose ground as far as a\ncommon reference but there sure are a\nlot of people who still talk about heat\nmaps what is a heat map well it is\nsimply a color map that's all it is so\nif you ever see the term heat map\nthat refers to the fact this is in\ndifferent colors representing different\nheights\nthat one is in the heat map but you can\nsee up here we switched into\nlet me go back up here here we go this\none has different colors for the\ndifferent values\na lot of times you'll use like instead\nof x and y you might do a heat map\nwhere you have a fourth value and the\nfourth value represents the color and so\nyou'll see this 3d image and the nice\ncolors represented by heat map that's\nall it is so if you see the term heat\nmap that only means we're plotting some\nof the data in color to make it stand\nout or to give it a fourth dimension in\nthis case\nso we've covered a lot of things on\nmatplot and that brings us cover all the\nbasics so that brings us to practice\nexample and this is going to be the\nchallenge for you and let me go ahead\nand change our cell\ncell type mark down and run that so it\nlooks pretty\npractice example write a path python\nprogram to create a pie chart of the\npopularity of programming languages\nokay excellent\nand if you're going to have a challenge\nwe need some data and i'll just throw in\nour import our map library at the\nbeginning you should do that\nautomatically\nand so for our data to plot we're going\nto have our languages we're going to\nhave python we're going to have java php\njavascript c sharp c plus so those are\nsix categories and then we have our\npopularity oops misspelling there\npopularity we'll give the first one 22.2\npercent java 17.6 and i don't know if\nthese are real numbers they pulled\nmy guess is that they might have just\nbeen made up because i don't know\npython's really that much more popular\nthan the other ones maybe specific to\ndata science because python is very\npopular in data science right now\nbecause it has so many options the only\nother program that's highly used\nexclusively for data science is r so\npython's big and python also does a lot\nmore it's a full programming language\nwhere r is primarily for data science\nthey didn't put r in here so we have\npython we have java we have our php and\nyou can see the different values they've\ngiven it are different percentages\nand i did add these up does not add up\nto 100 it adds up to 71 percent or\nsomething like that\nand then we're going to give colors and\nwe've chosen these guys in the back\nbrought in these colors i'm not sure\nwhat these colors are we'll find out in\na minute so i'll be exciting but you can\nsee they're using the actual color\nvalues you can pull off of a color wheel\nor something like that you could have\njust as easily done blue red green if\nyou're too lazy to pick the exact colors\nand then let's go ahead and solve this\nand see we got here we're going to do\nsomething a little fancy just because we\ncan\nthe first thing we're going to do is\nwe're going to use a variable called\nexplode and you'll notice that there's\nsix variables in here so that matches\nour six different categories and the\nfirst one we've done is point one and\nthen zero zero zero zero zero point one\nwhen we put this in here under the\nexplode in the plot it will actually\npush that square out so it's a really\ncool feature to highlight certain\ninformation on a pie chart\nand this is simply\nplt.pi and we're plotting\npopularity there we go and before we add\nin all the really cool settings for this\nlet's go ahead and run it and you'll see\nwe generate a nice flat pie not too\nexciting there and then we'll go ahead\nand put in all the extras i talked about\nexplode we can explode one of the values\nout so here's our explode equals explode\nlabels as languages because we want to\nknow what the different colors mean\nhere's our colors equals colors\nour auto picture and this is standard\nprint format so that's a python setup on\nthere and that's just going to put the\nvalue on the pie slice and then we're\ngoing to add shadow because it just\nlooks cooler with a shadow gives a\nlittle 3d look and we'll do a start\nangle of 140. let's go ahead and run\nthis and take a look and see what comes\nout of that\nand look how that changes the whole\nsetup so here's our labels there's our\nvalue we put on there there's our slice\nit's pushed out there's our shadow a 3d\neffect\nand then we started at 140. we could\nalso rotate this let's just do this\nangle\n90\nand if we run it\nyou'll see the blue pie slice has moved\nup a little bit we could actually do\nactually let's just take the whole\nstarting triangle out and run it'll\ndefault to zero\nthis is what it looks like if it\ndefaulted to zero so depending on where\nyou want the highlighted slice to appear\nusually you want that to appear on the\nleft because people read left to right\nand so it draws a focus onto in this\ncase python and how great python is i'm\na little biased we're teaching a python\ntutorial so it should be understandable\nthat we're looking at python and one\nlast reference before we close you can\ngo over to the map plot library dot pi\nplot set up and if you go underneath\nthere the different functions on there\nyou can look this up on their website\nyou'll see a full list and this is why\nit's so important to go through a\ntutorial like this because this list is\njust so massive trying to figure out\nlike here's our bar plot there's a bar h\nyou can add barbs there's a box plot we\ndidn't cover\nc labels a totally different kind of for\nyour contour plot you can set up in\nthere if you go down here we have our\nfigures we used on there we showed you\nthe basics how to do the figure you'll\nsee some\ncloser references on those\nthere's a histogram down here hist\nthere's also the his 2d makes a 2d\nhistogram plot h lines all of this these\nare all the different commands that are\nunderneath of here and you can see it's\npretty extensive\nwe've covered all the basic ones so that\nyou know have a solid ground to look at\nthese different options so when you come\nto these functions some of them are\ngoing to look a little off or not off\nwill look unfamiliar but you'll still\nhave the availability to probably\nunderstand most of this and have a basic\nunderstanding of your matplot library\nand that brings us to the end of this\nvideo tutorial and data visualization\nfull course\nto learn more on such technologies\nplease subscribe to the simply loan\nchannel thank you for watching and keep\nlearning\n",
