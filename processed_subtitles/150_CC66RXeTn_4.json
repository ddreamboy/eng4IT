  "text": "what up done nerds i'm luke a data\nanalyst and my channel is all about tech\nand skills for data science and in this\nvideo today i wanted to cover my pathway\nfor becoming a data analyst if i had to\nstart over again and for this i'm not\ngoing to be only sharing the skills that\ni recommend learning but also my process\nfor learning different skills which i've\napplied and refined over my time in\nschool learning engineering to my time\nin the navy learning how to drive a\nnuclear-powered submarine and then more\nrecently to learning all the different\nskills of a data analyst in order to\ncontinue to gress further in my job this\nprocess has also been refined by my\ninteractions from others that have not\nonly gotten jobs as data analysts but\nalso hired others for these roles as\nwell my journey was filled with a lot of\nwasted time and effort and so i'm hoping\nthat this video helps save you effort\nand also time and learning the skills\nyou need to know for your job so let's\nbreak into my recipe for learning\nanything and it's an iterative two-step\napproach that i recommend taking that\ncan be applied to anything that you\nreally want to learn the process\nconsists of learning it and then using\nit so let's expand further into what you\nshould be learning as a data analyst and\ni feel that there are four general areas\nthat you should be focusing on that\nconsist of technical skills soft skills\nanalytical skills and domain knowledge\ndon't worry we'll go into all these\ngeneral topic areas in a bit but we need\nto move to that next step of actually\napplying it immediately after learning\nit and using it is it true that if you\ndon't use it you lose it\nis that a serious question which in this\ncase is quite literally true because the\ntools that i've learned in the past and\nhaven't applied i haven't been able to\nretain them so i feel like this is a\nreally key important aspect in order to\nretain that skill and you can use these\nskills in a variety of different ways\nsuch as coursework projects on coursera\nportfolio projects for your resume work\nprojects for your job and then also\nthrough teaching others now there's an\nadded benefit of this second step and\nthat's that because you've created\nsomething with your new skills you now\nhave something to showcase to an\nemployer as experience so when you're\nsearching for a job you can now display\nthis item that you created for employers\nto see i've rambled about this before\nbut i think that online courses and\ncertificates are great for this first\nstep in the process of learning things\nbut if you don't have experience to\nshowcase on a resume on how you use\nthese skills that you learned an\nemployer is not going to risk hiring you\nand all of this relates directly to the\nsponsor of this video coursera coursera\ndoes a great job of hosting courses so\nthat way you can learn the skills in\nthat first step of the process but also\nin that second step of using something\nit then goes and has projects available\nfor its specializations and certificates\nand this is great because you can not\nonly display your certificate or\nspecialization on a resume you can also\nshowcase those projects as experience\nfor employers to see so getting back to\nmy learning process so once you have\nlearned a skill and then used it it's\nthen time to iterate back and learn a\nnew skill so where do you actually start\nand what skill should you focus on first\nfor learning a skill my preference is to\nstart with those technical skills and\nthen also incorporate those other skills\nsuch as analytical or domain knowledge\nwhile you're learning a technical skill\nso why do i say start on a technical\nskill first so one i feel like they're\nmore tangible and they're easier to set\ngoals that you can actually accomplish\nsuch as you can write out what functions\nyou want to learn for excel and then\nlearn it i also find that technical\nskills are funner to learn and i have\nhigher motivation levels when actually\nsetting out to accomplish that and two\nthey allow you to apply other skills\nwhile actually focusing on that\ntechnical skill for example say you're\nlearning a technical skill such as like\nr you could also write a blog post about\nit and this would showcase and build on\nyour soft skill of writing so\ntechnically you're not only focusing on\ntechnical skills but you're also trying\nto incorporate those other skills as\nwell alright so let's jump into my\ntechnical skill roadmap so i recently\ndid a data analytics project where i\nwent through and scraped job posting\ndata from linkedin i was able to find\nthe most important skills for\nentry-level data analysts based on how\nmany times a skilled appeared in a job\nposting so my insights from this project\nwere this that excel and sql are the\nmost important skills to learn of a data\nanalyst as they comprise almost half of\nall job postings following in popularity\nare the bi tools of tableau and power bi\nand then also the programming tools such\nas python or r so from this my\nrecommended roadmap is this first i\nrecommend getting a brief overview of\nall the different tools i think this is\ngoing to help with later on identifying\ntools that you want to focus on based on\nwhat your passion and interest is in i\nlike the google data analytics\ncertificate because it teaches you a lot\nabout the popular tools of sql\nspreadsheets are in tableau and then\ngoing back to my recommendation on how\nto learn it not only teaches you about\nthese skills but then you also implement\nthese skills in a capstone project for\nthe certificate now this first step in\nthe process is all about breadth not\ndepths and the google certificate is\nperfect for this because you're not\ngoing to be a master of any of these\nskills once you complete it but you will\nhave a general overview of these tools\nand you also have an introduction to\nother skills as well such as soft skills\nand domain knowledge next it's time to\nget into a mastering skill and for this\nwe need to focus on either excel or sql\ni recommend these two most popular tool\nof data analysts because from a\nprobabilistic standpoint if you have\nthese two skills on your resume i feel\nlike you're more likely to get hired for\nan entry level data analyst job now\nregarding whether to use excel or sql\nfirst i really leave that up to you if\nyou're looking for recommendations for\nresources to learn these type of skills\ncheck out this recent video i did where\ni went over some top courses to learn\nthe skills of a data analyst next after\nmastering both excel and sql it's time\nto get into mastering other tools such\nas bi tools and programming languages\nonce again when selecting one of these\ntools i'd go off what your passion is\nselect one that you have an interest for\nand you really want to dive into and\nlearn and apply other skills with i\nthink it's important to understand that\nyou don't have to master every single\none of these skills here in order to\nland your first job as a data analyst my\nfirst job i landed with only the skills\nof excel but i continued to progress my\nskills and because of that i began\nand because of that i continued to\nadvance in my career as a data analyst\nbeing able to level up and get different\nopportunities based on the skills i was\nlearning so that's my roadmap for\ntechnical skills but what about those\nother areas of analytical skills domain\nknowledge and soft skills and what do i\nmean by these skills and how do i\nincorporate them while learning those\ntechnical skills let's break it down\nfirst up is analytical skills and by\nthis i mean things like problem solving\ncritical thinking research and then math\nskills so i get a lot of questions\naround this math skill whether more\nin-depth training or studies is needed\nprior to taking any courses or prior to\ndiving into the field of data analytics\npart of my life as a data analyst i was\nfortunate enough to be exposed to a lot\nof different math subjects so everything\nfrom algebra to more advanced\nmathematics like calculus and\ndifferential equations\nbecause of this and now being my role of\ndata analyst i can say that the most of\nthe math that i've applied to my job has\nbeen pretty basic math and has focused\non algebra probability and statistics i\ndon't think subjects like calculus and\ndiscrete math are necessary especially\nfor entry-level data analyst roles and\nthe good news is that for most secondary\nschools like high schools in the united\nstates you're exposed to subjects such\nas algebra and also other subjects like\nprobability and statistics so based on\nthis i wouldn't necessarily worry that\nyou don't have the math skills to get\nstarted instead if you don't know\nsomething in math you can then learn it\nor apply it in a project as you're going\nalong so getting back to how to apply\nanalytical skills in a project\nwhen i was learning excel one of my\nportfolio projects that i was working on\nin school was building a food nutrition\ncalculator this was a spreadsheet that\ncould tell you what to eat in order to\nbe healthy this project not only\nrequired learning excel it also applied\nprobability and statistics in\ndetermining what foods to recommend\nalong with basic algebra in calculating\nmacronutrient values of food this\nproject was not only great for teaching\nme the technical skill of excel but also\ntesting my analytical skills in solving\nthis problem of building this calculator\ninteresting enough this project got\nbrought up multiple times in different\njob interviews i were in specifically by\ninterviewees that were interested in\nphysical fitness and well-being and it\nwas really great because it allowed me\nto connect on a similar interest with\nthe interviewee next up is domain\nknowledge and this is knowledge of a\nspecific discipline or field so for\nexample i recently asked you all what\nfields you were transitioning from to\nbecome a data analyst and the results\nrange from students and business and\nengineering to those working in an\nindustry such as education and health\ncare from what i found you don't have to\nactually switch industries or domains in\norder to become a data analyst in fact\nwhat i found is those that have the most\nsuccess in becoming data analysts apply\nthose newly learned data analytical\nskills in the current domain or industry\nthat they're in as an example of this in\nmy first role i was working in the\nprocurement industry working only with\nthe skill of excel at the time i was\nlooking to improve my bi tools and an\nopportunity came up to build a solution\nusing power bi as i had a general\nunderstanding of this field of\nprocurement i was able to apply these\nnewly learned skills of power bi in my\nrole to build this dashboard but also i\nwas able to actually go more in depth\nand learn even more about this field of\nprocurement so for those that are\nworking in an industry or maybe going to\nschool to learn a certain subject i\nhighly encourage you to take a similar\napproach and dive into a tool while also\ndiving deeper into that domain so you\ncan apply those skills in a relevant\nproject last up is soft skills and this\nrelates to how you work and also\ninteract with other people with the\ncurrent pandemic this shifted the way\nthat we're interacting with each other\nand instead of doing the normal\nface-to-face interactions we've actually\nshifted this quite differently to using\nalternate forms of communication i\nactually think this is a positive in\nthat you can actually showcase these\nalternate forms of communication in your\nportfolio and in the projects that you\ndo so what do i mean by this well when i\nwas learning tableau i decided to make a\nyoutube series documenting my learnings\nthese videos were not only improving my\ntableau skills but also a way for me to\nimprove my soft skills of communication\nwhere i was getting first hand feedback\non my presentation skills now i'm not\nsaying that you have to make youtube\nvideos per se\ninstead what i'm saying is that you can\nuse social media in order to showcase\nthose soft skills that you have such as\nwriting posts or tutorials on medium\nsharing your code or processes on github\nor making short form content on\ninstagram or tick tock all these not\nonly have the benefit of working on\nthose technical and soft skills they\nalso are able to be used and showcase\nyour experience for employers to see how\nyou interact with others all right so\nthat's my roadmap on how i've learned to\nbecome a data analyst remember this is\nnot a comprehensive plan so you don't\nneed to learn every single skill that i\nshowed here today\ninstead i'd start small right so start\nwith that one technical still and add in\nanother skill maybe analytical or soft\nskill that you want to work on and build\na project from there iterate remember\nfor me one skill of excel was good\nenough to get my first job as an analyst\nand i feel the same can apply to you as\nwell as always if you got value out of\nthis video smash that like button and\nwith that\n[Music]\n[Music]\nnew video from ken on how to start in\ndata science yes\nevery year i like to refresh my advice\nabout how i feel about learning data\nscience\nthe data domain is changing\n[Music]\nlearn more about data science in the\nupcoming year thank you so much for\nwatching and good luck on your data\nscience journey\nwait a second we need a video like this\nbut for data analysts\nwhat i've done nerds i'm luke a dad\nanalyst and my channel\n",
