  "text": "ever wondered how google translates an\nentire web page to a different language\nin a matter of seconds or your phone\ngallery group's images based on their\nlocation all of this is a product of\ndeep learning but what exactly is deep\nlearning deep learning is a subset of\nmachine learning which in turn is a\nsubset of artificial intelligence\nartificial intelligence is a technique\nthat enables a machine to mimic human\nbehavior machine learning is a technique\nto achieve ai through algorithms trained\nwith data and finally deep learning is a\ntype of machine learning inspired by the\nstructure of the human brain in terms of\ndeep learning this structure is called\nan artificial neural network let's\nunderstand deep learning better and how\nit's different from machine learning say\nwe create a machine that could\ndifferentiate between tomatoes and\ncherries if done using machine learning\nwe'd have to tell the machine the\nfeatures based on which the two can be\ndifferentiated these features could be\nthe size and the type of stim on them\nwith deep learning on the other hand the\nfeatures are picked out by the neural\nnetwork without human intervention of\ncourse that kind of independence comes\nat the cost of having a much higher\nvolume of data to train our machine\nnow let's dive into the working of\nneural networks\nhere we have three students each of them\nwrite down the digit 9 on a piece of\npaper\nnotably they don't all write it\nidentically the human brain can easily\nrecognize the digits\nbut what if a computer had to recognize\nthem\nthat's where deep learning comes in\nhere's a neural network trained to\nidentify handwritten digits\neach number is present as an image of 28\ntimes 28 pixels\nnow that amounts to a total of 784\npixels\nneurons the core entity of a neural\nnetwork is where the information\nprocessing takes place\neach of the 784 pixels is fed to a\nneuron in the first layer of our neural\nnetwork\nthis forms the input layer\non the other end we have the output\nlayer with each neuron representing a\ndigit with the hidden layers existing\nbetween them\nthe information is transferred from one\nlayer to another over connecting\nchannels\neach of these has a value attached to it\nand hence is called a weighted channel\nall neurons have a unique number\nassociated with it called bias\nthis bias is added to the weighted sum\nof inputs reaching the neuron\nwhich is then applied to a function\nknown as the activation function\nthe result of the activation function\ndetermines if the neuron gets activated\nevery activated neuron passes on\ninformation to the following layers\nthis continues until the second last\nlayer the one neuron activated in the\noutput layer corresponds to the input\ndigit the weights and bias are\ncontinuously adjusted to produce a\nwell-trained network so where is deep\nlearning applied in customer support\nwhen most people converse with customer\nsupport agents the conversation seems so\nreal they don't even realize that it's\nactually a bot on the other side in\nmedical care neural networks detect\ncancer cells and analyze mri images to\ngive detailed results self-driving cars\nwhat seem like science fiction is now a\nreality apple tesla and nissan are only\na few of the companies working on\nself-driving cars so deep learning has a\nvast scope but it too faces some\nlimitations the first as we discussed\nearlier is data while deep learning is\nthe most efficient way to deal with\nunstructured data a neural network\nrequires a massive volume of data to\ntrain let's assume we always have access\nto the necessary amount of data\nprocessing this is not within the\ncapability of every machine and that\nbrings us to our second limitation\ncomputational power training in neural\nnetwork requires graphical processing\nunits which have thousands of cores as\ncompared to cpus and gpus are of course\nmore expensive and finally we come down\nto training time deep neural networks\ntake hours or even months to train the\ntime increases with the amount of data\nand number of layers in the network so\nhere's a short quiz for you arrange the\nfollowing statements in order to\ndescribe the working of a neural network\na the bias is added b the weighted sum\nof the inputs is calculated c specific\nneuron is activated d the result is fed\nto an activation function leave your\nanswers in the comments section below\nthree of you stand a chance to win\namazon vouchers so hurry some of the\npopular deep learning frameworks include\ntensorflow pytorch keras deep learning\n4j cafe and microsoft cognitive toolkit\nconsidering the future predictions for\ndeep learning and ai we seem to have\nonly scratched the surface in fact horus\ntechnology is working on a device for\nthe blind that uses deep learning with\ncomputer vision to describe the world to\nthe users replicating the human mind at\nthe entirety may be not just an episode\nof science fiction for too long the\nfuture is indeed full of surprises and\nthat is deep learning for you in short\nif you enjoyed this video do like and\nshare it also subscribe to our channel\nif you haven't yet as we have a lot more\nexciting videos coming up fun learning\ntill then\n",
