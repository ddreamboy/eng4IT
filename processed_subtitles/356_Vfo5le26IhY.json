  "text": "data science and machine learning is the\nhardest job of the 21st century with an\naverage salary of\n$120,000 per year according to LinkedIn\nthe data science job profile is among\nthe top five jobs in the entire world\nnow if you want to for into the world of\ndata science you need to have good\ncommand over statistics as it forms the\nbase of all the data science Concepts so\nwith the help of Statistics you can make\npredictions such as New York will be hit\nwith multiple tornadoes at the end of\nthis month or the stock market is going\nto crash by this weekend now all of this\nsounds magical doesn't it well to be\nhonest it just statistics and not magic\nand you don't really need a crystal ball\nto see into the future so keeping the\nimportance of Statistics in mind we have\ncome up with this comprehensive course\nby Dr abanda sarar Dr abanda sarar has\nhis PhD in statistics from Stanford\nUniversity he has Tau Applied\nMathematics at the Massachusetts\nInstitute of Technology being on the\nresearch staff at IBM let quality and\nengineering development and analytics\nfunctions at General Electric and as\nco-founded omix Labs we are uploading\nthis highquality classroom session by Dr\nabanda sarar from great learnings\nbusiness analytics and business\nintelligence course it has been ranked\nnumber one analytics program\nconsecutively for the past 4 years this\ntutorial will be on YouTube for only a\nlimited period of time so that Learners\nacross the world can have access to high\nquality content so please do subscribe\nto Great learn YouTube channel and share\nthe video with your peers so that\neveryone can learn from the best now\nwithout further delay let's have a quick\nglance at the agenda we'll start off by\nunderstanding the difference between\nstatistics and machine\nlearning then we'll go through different\ntypes of Statistics which are\ndescriptive predictive and\nprescriptive after that we'll understand\nthe different types of data available\ngoing ahead we'll understand the concept\nof correlation and co-variance\ncomprehensively\nfollowing which we'll head on to\nprobability and learn how to implement\nconditional probability with base\ntheorem and finally we'll look at two\ntypes of probability distribution\nbinomial distribution and poison\ndistribution so let's start off with the\nsession what you now need to do is you\nnow need to be able to get the data to\nsolve this\nproblem\nso therefore the statistical way of\nthinking typically says you formulate a\nproblem and then you get the data to\nsolve that problem the machine learning\nwe have looking at things typically says\nhere is the data tell me what that data\nis telling you many of my colleagues and\nI myself have run into this problem when\ngoing for interviews etc etc and so uh\num sort of statisticians say that um\nwe're not getting jobs out there and so\nI go to uh go to people who are hiring\nand saying that why don't you hire\nstatisticians and I reach an interesting\nconclusion to this entire discussion um\nthat sometimes around the way the\ninterviewer who's interviewing the\nstatisticians for a data scientist job\nask the\nquestion um here is my\ndata what can you say and the\nstatistician answers with something like\nwhat do you want to know and the\nbusiness guy says but that's why I want\nto hire you and the statistician says\nbut if you don't tell me what what you\nwant to know how do I know what to tell\nyou and this goes round and round right\nno one's happy about this entire\nprocess so there's a difference in the\nway these two communities approach\nthings my job is not to resolve\nthat because in the world that you will\nface you'll see a lot more of this kind\nof thinking than you'll see in this\nthinking because in this\nworld the data is cheap and the question\nis\nexpensive and you're paid for asking the\nright\nquestion in this world the question is\ncheap and the data is expensive you're\npaid for collecting the\ndata so sometimes you will be in a\nsituation where this is going to be\nimportant for example let's suppose\nyou're trying to\nunderstand who's going to buy my\nproduct you're asking the question let's\nsay that my products aren't\nselling and you want to find out\nwhy what will you\ndo get what data so let's say that\nyou're selling your I don't know what do\nyou want to sell\num you want to sell watches say so let's\nsuppose people AR buy buying watches\nanymore which is a reality correct so\nyou're a watch company who buys watches\nthese the entire business model of a\nwatches\ndisappearing do you have watches some of\nyou\nhave he has actually a surprising number\nof you\nhave maybe they do different things\nthese days right that that seems like a\nvery that that's a fitness device is not\nreally a watch at\nall so so something like this was\nactually with my daughter at lunch today\nso she got something like this I'm not\nsure my my my my wife who's an\nentrepreneur runs their own company she\ncame back from Delhi she came back with\ntwo of these I don't know where she\npicked them up so my my daughter the\nfirst thing she did she took one of this\nand she took this thing\nout because she thought of the whole\nwristband as an unnecessary\nidea I mean she that didn't occur to her\nI mean that's a separate thing that's a\nnice little beautiful red wristband Etc\nso a watch is a different thing but\nlet's say that you're a watch company\nnobody's buying your watches or fewer\npeople are buying your watches now how\nare you going to solve this problem or\nhow you going to process this\ninformation what do you want to do what\ndo you want to know\ntheel okay but remember I'm asking this\nquestion also from an analytical\nperspective So when you say that to\ncheck the model and see what is not sold\nthat assumes the whole data question so\nyou so first order you'll see\nsales for whom and when and how how do\nyou structure your data how will you how\nwill you arrange the\nproblem comp are your competitors sing\nokay that makes problems even harder\nbecause now you're going to look for\ndata that isn't with\nyou no no he's right he's right he's\nright maybe people are not buying\nwatches because they're buying something\nelse that's a reasonable\nthing but let's keep this problem simple\nlet's consider only data that is within\nyou we'll go outside not to worry but\nlet's say that I'm looking at my data\nwhat data do I want to see and what\nquestions do I want to ask of it let's\nso sales year by year types and then\nwhat comparisons do I want to do year on\nyear year on year region\nregion wise age with what purpose what\nquestion am I asking the data what\nsection of customers are buying my\nproduct or what section of customers are\nbuying my product compared to\nwhat what has changed in terms of the\nwhat are my biggest set of customers so\nthat's so that's one thing who who are\nmy biggest customers okay that's a very\ninteresting question to ask except that\nthat question implies that I needed to\nknow who my biggest set of customers\nsort of could have\nbeen but it's a good point where is the\nbulk of my sales coming from then\nsomeone else say something about time\nyou know is it going is it going down so\nyou can look at things like saying that\nfor which group of\ncustomers are my sales going down the\nmost for example you could ask that I'm\nnot saying that's the right question but\nthat's a possible question to ask so\nlet's suppose you follow that approach\nthat I'm trying to understand I know\nthat my are going down that's an obvious\nthing my CEO is telling my CFO is\ntelling me and if I don't stop this\nwe're all going to be out of a\njob correct the HMT factories in\nBangalore are not in good shape one of\nthem I think has become the income tax\noffice right somewhere in the mishwar\narea so that's going to happen to me if\nI if I don't do this well so I know my\nsales are going down but I don't know by\nhow much and particularly for whom so\nare there segments for which the sales\nare going down which segments are sales\ngoing down the most in which segments\nare they going down a little bit how\nfast are they going\ndown I can question I can ask questions\nof that\nsort now what conclusions at the end of\nthis do I want to be able to\ndo how do I need to how do I want to use\nthis\ninformation now for this you usually\nfollow something like a three-step\nprocess and you may have seen this and\nthis this covers both these sides and\nthese words should be should be familiar\nto you to some extent the first is\ncalled\ndescriptive the second is called\npredictive and the third is\ncalled\nprescriptive have these words been\nintroduced to you at least in this at\nleast you've read it I'm sure you you\nall Cruise the web and look at blogs and\nthings like that nothing new in this I'm\nsure but I just want to set a context\nbecause it's going to talk a little bit\nof what we descriptive there's a c\nhere so descriptive predictive and\nprescriptive now what is a descriptive\nproblem the descriptive problem is a\nproblem that says that describe for me\nwhere and I'm losing my sales and when\nI'm losing my\nsales it just describes the problem for\nme it tells me where the problem is it\nlocates it it isolates\nit the predictive problem says look at\nthis\ndata and give me an idea as to what\nmight\nhappen or what would happen if I change\nthis that or the other so let's suppose\nI do the following kind of idea I say\nthat let me relate my sales to my prices\nlet me try and understand that if I\nreduce my prices of my watches will more\npeople buy\nthem conversely if I make my Watches\nluxury items increase the\nprice of a\nwatch remove a low-end brand and make a\nwatch an aspirational thing a decorative\nitem a luxury item a brand item so that\npeople wear a watch not to see the time\nbut also as a Prestige statement as a\nfashion statement whatever it is if I do\nthis then what will\nhappen that's predictive I'm trying to\npredict something based on it I'm trying\nto say if something happens to let's say\none part of my data what will happen to\nthe other part of my data and then and\nbased on that the doctor carries out a\npredictive analysis of you because I see\nthis I now think you have this\nissue you have this thing going on let's\nsay I'm diagnosing you as being\npre-diabetic you're not yet diabetic but\nyou're happily on the way to becoming a\ndiabetic now because of this I now have\nto issue you a\nprescription I now should tell you what\nto\ndo\nso there's a data that comes from you\nthat data in some way is modeled using\nthe domain knowledge that the doctor\nhas and that model has translated into a\ninto an action that action is designed\nto do\nsomething typically it's designed to do\nsomething actually fairly\ncomplicated the first action the doctor\ntries to do is number one let's say Do\nno harm the hypocritic\noath first let me make sure that that I\ndon't do any unnecessary harm to the\npatient then let me shall I say optimize\nhis or her\nWelfare by making sure that I control\nthe blood sugar the best and that I\npostpone the onset of diabetes as best\nas I\ncan it's a complex optimization problem\nof some sort in a business also it's a\ncomplex optimization\nproblem right I need to be able to sell\nmore\nwatches but I also need to be able to\nmake money doing so I can increase my\nsales but if I increase my sales\nand my profits go down or my earnings Go\nDown based on the cost then that's a\nproblem but at the same time if I try to\nrun a profitable business and nobody\nbuys my product that also is not a\nparticularly good\nidea then there are other issues maybe\nin running the company I've got\nemployees that I want to keep on the on\non on the boards how do I run the\ncompany in such a way so that it needs\nthat particular labor\nforce I have finances to take care of I\nhave loans to repay how do I get the\ncash flow in order to repay the bank\nloans that I have so the prescription\nhas to meet lots and lots of\nrequirements if you're building an\nautonomous vehicle you'll have\nsituations saying the car has to do\nthis but it also has to follow certain\nother rules for example if it sees\nsomeone crossing the road it should stop\nbut it shouldn't stop very suddenly\nbecause if it stops very suddenly is\ngoing to hurt the car it's also probably\ngoing to hurt the\ndriver so it can it should needs to stop\nbut it shouldn't stop too suddenly it\nhas to follow the rules of the\nroad because otherwise the computer will\nsimply say oh you want me to avoid the\nperson crossing the road I'm just going\nto go behind the\nperson and you going going to tell the\ncar please don't do that because there's\na house next to\nit you can't just sort of do that oh you\ndidn't tell me that you just told me to\navoid the person you didn't tell me\nabout the\nhouse okay we'll put that as a\nconstraint in our program and see how\nwell it goes so prescription is\nproblematic another simple way of doing\nit might be to say that description is\nhow many centuries has Virat kohi scored\nlook up Crick info and it'll give you\nthe\nanswer prediction might be try to guess\nhow many centuries verat kohi will score\nin the World Cup prescription might be\nhow do we get vat kohi to score more\ncenturies in the world\ncup and as you can figure out you're\ngoing from a purely data BAS version of\nthe problem into something that's only\nnotionally about the data data will help\nyou but there's a lot more than the data\nwhen it gets to\nthat what we'll do today what we'll do\nnow once I've finished talking to you is\nwe'll we'll take a look at what\ndescriptive what the the descriptive\npart of analytics\nis so the descriptive part of analytics\nis talking about simply describing the\ndata without necessarily trying to build\nany prediction or any models into it\nsimply telling you the way it is this is\nhard this is in itself not necessarily\nan easy thing to do because you need to\nknow very well how to do that and what\nare the ways in which one looks at\ndata this is skillful in\nitself so for example let's suppose that\nyou are you're the I'm you're a do you\ngo to the doctor and the the doctor is\nlooking at you looking at your symptoms\nand the the doctor\nrecommends a blood test now how does a\ndoctor know what blood test to\nrecommend based on the symptoms based on\nthe symptoms but remember that\npotentially there's an enormous amount\nof information in\nyou all of us as biological things carry\nan enormous amount of information in in\nour blood in our neurons in our genes or\nwherever you know if you're talking\nabout Big Data as I said there's 2\nmeters inside every cell and there are a\nfew billion neurons in your head\nyou don't need to go far to see big data\nyou are big\ndata you are one walking example of big\ndata we all\nare right now in that big data what\nlittle data does\nthe doctor know to\nsee that's a descriptive analytics\nproblem the doctor is not doing any\ninference on it the doctor is not\nbuilding a conclusion on it the doctor\nis not building an AI system on it but\nit's still a hard problem because given\nthe vast amount of data that the that\nthe that the doctor could potentially\nsee the doctor needs to know that I I\nthis is interesting to me and this is\ninteresting to me and this is\ninteresting to me and this is\ninteresting to me in this particular\nway for example a blood test let's\nsuppose that I draw I draw blood from\nyou for a particular purpose let's say\nfor blood sugar correct leaving aside\nthe biology of how much blood etc etc to\ndraw\num\njust neither none of you I guess are a\ndo any of you are doctors here any\ndoctors in the\nroom doctor so I can say whatever I want\nyou won't understand what I'm saying no\nno but so but I'm old enough that this\nis a real problem for me so you have a\nyou have a large amount of blood that's\nflowing through you we all do this blood\ncarries\nnutrients what that does is that every\ntime there is a nutrient inflow the\nblood looks a little different\nso if you eat your blood looks a little\ndifferent because that's your blood's\njob the blood's job is to carry\nnutrients if you want to run you want to\nwalk if I'm walking around my legs are\ngetting energy from\nsomewhere the energy need from my legs\nis being carried from the blood and it\nis being generated through inputs that I\nget some of it because of the air that I\nbreathe from where it gets the oxygen to\nburn things some from the food that I've\neaten the nice lunch that that I had\nwhere it gets the calories to do that so\ntherefore based on what my energy\nrequirements are and based on what I've\neaten my blood is not\nconstant my blood content is what is\nknown as a random\nvariable what's random about it because\nit looks a different it looks really\ndifferent all the\ntime your blood at 12:00 is going to\nlook a little different 12:00 at\nmidnight is going to look a little\nlittle different from\n12:00 at noon because it's doing\nsomething a little\ndifferent the same phenomena is there\neverywhere if I were to for example\nmeasure the temperature of the oil in\nyour car or in your two- wheeler what do\nyou think that temperature will\nbe it depends first of all it depends on\nwhether the car is running or not it\ndepends on whether it has run or not it\ndepends on how much oil there is it\ndepends on how you drive it depends on\ntemperature rest of the car the answer\nis it\ndepends and the same is true for your\nbodily\nfluids so this becomes a slight problem\nbecause if it is\nrandom then from a random quantity how\ndo I conclude what your blood sugar\nis how does a doctor reach that reach a\nconclusion of any\nsort average of\nwhat average of particular duration so\nthere are multiple averages that you can\nget first of all there's a question of\nsaying that if I take blood from you how\nis the blood usually collected so the\nfotus comes and usually takes an\ninjection from one point let's say by\nsome strange accident this is Thoroughly\nin advised but let's say by say some\nstrange accident two different people\nare drawing blood from two hands at the\nsame time do not try this at\nhome but let's suppose they do do this\nwill they get the same\nblood IDE ideally yes it depends what\ntime\nsame right at the same time as I said do\nnot do this at home but at the same time\nyou're getting two different samples\nthere's not just a question of\ntime your blood is not going to look the\nsame even within your body at one period\nof\ntime even from the left hand even from\nthe right hand exactly the same period\nof time it's not going to look the\nsame there is a slight there is a slight\nproblem that somehow a little obvious\nthat that you know your your your heart\nis in the\nmiddle your heart is actually in the\nmiddle but it beats to the left\nwhy because the the heart is what the\nheart is both a pump and a suction\ndevice the pump side is on the left the\nsuction side is on the right so your\nblood pose out from your left side and\nit goes back in on the right side so\nthere's a slight asymmetry in your body\nbetween left and\nright one side tends to go out the other\nside tends to come in it's slight it\nmixes up all in the\nmiddle so one sampling idea is that I'm\ntaking a sample of blood from you and\nit's just one\nexample the second question is as you\nwere saying it's a question of time so\nyou can average over time if you average\nover time this is really easier you can\nsay I'm going to do this maybe before\neating after eating reg after eating so\nfor those of you who have blood pressure\ntest for example oh sorry blood sugar\ntest once they ask you to do it fasting\nand then they ask you to do it some 2\nhours after\neating do they tell you what to\neat sometimes with glucose okay\nsometimes they don't they they sort of\nsay that based on what you naturally eat\nlet me figure out what you are\nprocessing they expect you to eat a\ntypical meal and not go and eat you know\nlarge amounts of KFC if that is is not\nwhat you normally eat just eat what you\nnormally eat a vegetarian eat normal\nvegetan eat normal food and then figure\nit out let's see how how good your body\nis at trying it out so it's saying do a\nnormal thing and I'll take another\nnormal\nsample then one of you said something\nvery interesting they average things out\nnow what does averaging\ndo neutralize that's an interesting word\nto use neutralizes things Prov a general\nprovide\ncontext provide context context of what\ncontext there a good point so so what is\nthe doctor trying to do so let's let's\nsimplify things a little bit and say\nthat let's suppose that the doctor has a\nthreshold let's give it a number let's\nsay the doctor says that if your blood\nsugar is above 140 I'm going to do\nsomething if your blood sugar is say\nless than 140 I'm not going to do\nanything I don't know whether this is\nthe right number or not but just let's\nmake it up\nnow the doctor is going to see from you\na\nnumber it may be a single reading it may\nbe an average it may be a number of\nthings how is the doctor going to\ntranslate what they see from you and\ncompare it to the 140 how is that\ncomparison going to be\nmade maximum number of\npeople Maxim so let's suppose I have\njust one\nreading so let's suppose that I have one\nreading and that reading oh I don't know\nis\n135 I've just got one reading from you\n135 what does that tell\nme no test required one AR one argument\nis it's simple let's take a very machine\nlearning computer science view to this\n135 is less than\n140 ahuh so now he's saying yeah but you\nknow\nwhat let's say that 135 and another guy\nwho say 14 120 there should be something\nthat says that this 135 is a little bit\nmore trouble\nthan 120 closer to the threshold as he\nsays so maybe in other words this\nthreshold isn't quite\nas as simple as I thought it\nwas so I can solve this problem in one\nof two\nways one way to do this is to make this\n140 a little range\nthis is something called fuzzy\nlogic right in other words the question\nyou're asking becomes fuzzy not as crisp\nyou're not fiddling with the data you're\nfiddling with the boundary you're\nfiddling with the\nstandard the other way to do that is to\ncreate a little uncertainty or create a\nlittle plus minus around the reading\nitself around\n135 saying that if this is\n135 and let's suppose that I go and get\nanother reading and the second reading\nthat I get is say\n130 and the third reading that I get on\nthe day after that is say\n132 and I'll say\nOkay seems to be fine I might say but\nlet's suppose after\n135 the guy goes and I do my usual thing\nand I measure it again and this time it\ncomes out as\n157 and I do it again and it comes out\nas\n128 and I do it again it comes out to be\n152 so in both cases 135 was probably a\ngood number but in One cases 135 was\nwearing very little and the other cases\n135 was wearing a\nlot which gives me different\nideas as to how to process it so what\ndescriptive analytics talks about\nessentially is trying to understand\nunderstand certain things about data\nthat helps me get to conclusions of this\nkind a little more\nrigorously now to be able to quantify\nwhat these plus minuses are is going to\ntake a take us a little bit of time and\nwe will not get there this residency\nwe'll get their next\nresidency to say that in order to in\norder to say it's not 135 or 135 plus\nminus something that question now needs\nto be\nanswered but to do that I need to have\ntwo particular instruments at my\ndisposal one instrument that I need to\nhave at my disposal is to be able to\nknow what to measure I need to say what\ndoes an error mean I need a statement\nthat says that maybe I'm 95% confident\nthat something is happening I'm 95% sure\nthat this is below\n140 I need a way to express it and that\nis the language of\nprobability so what we will do tomorrow\nis we'll introduce a little bit of the\nlanguage of probability\nit'll be sort of unrelated to what we're\ndoing today so there's going to be a\nlittle bit of a\ndisconnect but what we're going to do is\nwe're going to create two sets of\ninstruments one instrument that is\npurely descriptive in\nnature and one set of instruments which\nis purely mathematical in nature so that\nI can put a mathematical statement on\ntop of a\ndescription and the reason I need to do\nthat is because the pure description is\nnot helping me solve the problem that\nI've set itself that I have set\nso therefore what will happen is you\nwill see in certain medical\ntests you will not see points like this\nyou will see\nintervals your number should be between\nthis and this your chestal number your\nHDL whatever should be between this and\nthis you won't see a number you'll see a\nrange the typ typifies the variation and\nin certain cases you will see thresholds\nor maybe the it's just a lower limit or\nan upper limit but you'll also see a\nrecommendation that says Please do this\nagain in other words I'm going to\ncompare I can't compare one number to to\none number one number to one number is\ntypically a very bad place for any kind\nof analyst to be in because you got no\nidea of which is error prone and where\nthe error is so therefore what happens\nis you try to improve one of those\nnumbers and so either by filling around\nwith the range or by getting more\nmeasurements and you'll do that and\nyou'll see that as we go along a little\nlater so this is a context\nfor for what we have uh in terms\nof terms of data let's see so this is a\nset of files that has been\nloaded uh it's a very standard set of\nfiles it's not mine to be honest uh I\njust want to make sure that I'm doing\nwhat I'm supposed to be\ndoing so so for reasons that are more to\ndo with security my understanding The\nNotebook will not\naccess your\ndrives so keep it on your desktop and\nnot complicate\nlife\nso uh and there is this\nnotebook it's called cardio goodness of\ngood the word statistics refers to the\nidea that this is comes from the\nstatistical way of thinking\nwhich as I said opposed to the machine\nlearning we have thinking is tends to be\na little more problem First Data next\nwhich means we worry about things like\nhypothesis and populations and sampling\nand questions like\nthat and the descriptive part refers to\nthe fact that it is not doing any\ninference it is not predicting anything\nit's not prescrib anything it is\nsimply telling you what is\nthere with respect to certain questions\nthat you might POS possibly ask of\nit now what is the context to the\ncase the market research team at a\ncompany's assigned the task to identify\nthe profile of the typical customer for\neach treadmill product offered by the\ncompany the market research team decides\nto investigate whether there are\ndifferences across product line with\nrespect to customer\ncharacteristics exactly what you guys\nwere suggesting that I should do with\nrespect to the watch understand who does\nwhat entirely logical the team decides\nto collect data on individuals who\npurchase a treadmill at a particular\nstore during the past 3 months like\nwatches they're now collect looking at\ndata for\ntreadmills and that is in the file in\nthe CSV\nfile so what you should have is you\nshould have a CSV file in the\nsame um\ndirectory and through the magic of\npython you don't have to worry about\nthings like\npath\nbefore we get\nthere remember because we're looking at\nthis statistically before we get the\ndata we should have a rough ideas as to\nwhat we're trying to do and so they say\nthat here are the kinds of data that we\nare looking at the kinds of products the\ngender the age in years education years\nrelationship status annual household\nincome average number of times a\ncustomer plans to use a treadmill each\nweek average noriz a customer expects to\nrun walk each week on a self-rated\nFitness scale on 1 to five where one is\nin poor shape and five is in excellent\nshape some of this is data some of this\nis\nopinion right some of this is opinion\nmasquerading as data like for example\nnumber of times a customer plans to use\na\ntreadmill hopeful wishful thinking it's\nstill data you're asking\nsomeone how many times will you use\nit her Rose daily no problem seven times\na week oh we'll see huh but it's still\ndata it's come from\nsomewhere so so what has happened the\nway to think about this is to say that I\nwant to understand a certain\nsomething and the certain some certain\nsomething has to do with the\ncharacteristics of customer uh customer\ncharacteristics and to do this you can\nthen use either you can either take\nlet's say a marketing point of view who\nbuys you can also take a product\nengineering kind of view what sells in\nother words what kind of\nproduct should I make Etc in business as\nyou probably know for those of you are\nany of you\nentrepreneurs one hand\nup there one hand up the closet\nentrepreneurs from what I could figure\nout right sometimes it's unclear what\nthat word means in other words you think\nyou are or you're not confident enough\nto call yourself one or you're doing\nthat uh in in it space if you're an\nentrepreneur for example in um in in\nphysical product space or even in\nsoftware space one of the things you\noften think about is What's called the\nproduct Market fit which is you're\nmaking\nsomething how do you match between what\nyou can\nmake and what people will\nbuy because if you make something that\npeople do not buy that doesn't make any\nsense on the other hand if you identify\nwhat people buy and you can't make it\nthat also doesn't make too much\nsense so the conclusions that we will\ndraw on this we will not draw on today\nbut the purpose is to be able to go\ntowards conclusions of that kind either\nisolate products isolate customers and\ntry and figure out what what they tell\nus pandas generally has a fair amount of\nStatistics built into it that's what it\nwas originally built\nfor numai is something that was built\nmore for mathematical problems than\nanything else so some of the\nmathematical algorithms that are needed\nare there there are other stat side\nplots in metal plot life or c Bor and\nmany other things that you have seen\nalready um python is still figuring out\nhow to arrange these libraries well\nenough uh the the shall we say the the\nthe programming bias sometimes shows\nthrough in the\nlibraries so I for one do not remotely\nknow this well enough to know what to\nimport up front but a good session you\nknow what to import up front and you do\nall this up front so you don't get stuck\nwith what you want to do the naming is\nup to you if you like the names as they\nare then that's fine you want a standard\nset of\nnames so when you wrote the data set if\nthis is in the right path just this will\nwork do\nCSV it's usually smart enough to convert\nExcel forms into\nCSV in other words if you have this as\nexcels and things like that it's usually\nsmart enough but if it isn't then just\ngo in and save an XLS file as a CSV file\nand operate that way in case it doesn't\ndo it on its\nown but more often than not what you see\nis that when you when you when when\nJupiter sees it it'll see an any excels\nfile as a CSV file or go and make the\nchange\nyourself or you can have other XLS other\nrestatements in it as well you can\nchange functions inside it and you can\nfigure out how much to head what this\ntells you is there's the head and the\ntail of the data this is simply to give\nyou a\nvisualization of what the data\nis um this gives a sense of what\nvariables are available to it um what\nkinds of variables they\nare we'll do we'll see a little bit of a\nsummary after this\nEtc so for example some of these are\nnumbers income what is\nincome income is annual household income\nthat's a\nnumber sum for example let's say gender\nm male female this is a categorical\nvariable this is not entered as a\nnumber it's entered as a text field if\nyou are in Excel for example right at\nthe Top If you go in and you see that it\nwill tell you how many\ndistinct entries there are how many\ndistinct settings there\nare so usually what happens right at the\nbeginning and a data frame like this if\nit is created this is a data frame if a\ndata frame is created when it gets\ncreated the software knows as to whether\nit is talking about a number or whether\nit is talking about\ncategories there are certain challenges\nto that you can see one particular\nchallenge to\nthis\num what does this 180\nmean\ncounts why do you think there are so\nmany decimal places that comes here 14\nyears of experience 16 years of\nexperience why is it going\n0\nthat's yes it does this because it sees\nother numbers where those decimal places\nare\nneeded so what it does is what any\nsoftware typically does is when it sees\ndata it sort of says that at what\ngranularity do I need to store the\ndata sometimes this is driven by your\ncomputer your 64 bit your 32bit and\nthings like\nthat but what it does is it means that\nthe data is stored in the data frame to\ncertain digits now usually you don't see\nthat you'll see it in this way but\nsometimes for example when you say\ninclude equal to or and and you ask for\na full description the data comes out in\nthis slightly irritating\nway h because of something here because\nof let's say the income field or any of\nthat now when it recommends when it\nlooks at the descriptions of this what\nis the description that it is reporting\nand how does it choose to report out the\ndescription in this particular situation\nso let's take a little bit of a closer\nlook at\nthis one thing\nhere look at the way it's done here so\ncount unique top frequency and then\nthere are certain things here mean\nstandard deviation minimum 25% 50% 75%\nand\nMax when it sees a variable like\ngender it reports out lots and lots of\nn what does that tell you right off the\nbat it can't do that which means it's\nnot a\nnumber this is not a number in other\nwords if you ask me to find the mean of\nsomething and you're giving me male and\nfemale as inputs I don't know what to\ndo which is an entirely reasonable stand\nto take for any reasonable algorithm\nright it it requires another kind of\ndescription for it to\nwork but the problem we describe this\nsyntax is that it's asking for the same\ndescription for all of them whether it's\nin significant digits whether it's in\ncolumns etc\netc so it's chosen this description and\nit says that that's all that I'm going\nto give\nyou but where it makes sense\nlet's say for example I look at\nage now for age I've got 180\nobservations and it is calculating\ncertain descriptions for\nit\ncorrect so what are the discriptions\nthat is calculating let's look at these\nis calculating a desription like say\nminimum minimum is what 18 maximum is 50\nthese are easy to\nunderstand\nthen let's look at something really\ninteresting suppose I want to report one\nnumber one representative\nage for this data\nset this is like asking the question how\ndo I get a representative blood sugar\nnumber for\nyou I can give you a minimum and a\nmaximum but to do the minimum the\nmaximum I need to draw blood many many\ntimes from\nyou but let's suppose I want to this I\nwant one representative age for you\nsomebody asks you what is your blood\nsugar you want to give them one\nnumber similarly somebody's looking at\nthis data and ask the question give me a\nrepresentative age how old is your\ntypical user or what age do you want to\nbuild it for or you're even asking a\nyou're even asking let's say a product\nquestion you're a product designer and a\nproduct designer building a\ntreadmill now how do you design a\nproduct those of you\nEngineers based on based on the weight\nnow very good what weight who's weight\nhuh who's the\nuser what is the weight of the user he's\ngot a good point as as a design engineer\nI need to know what weight will be on\nthat\ntreadmill now what is the answer to that\nquestion Max us who visit the gym huh so\nthere's a question of saying that if I\nwant to measure a variable by one number\nhow should I even frame that\nquestion what makes\nsense what is the one\naverage no Max in this particular case\nyou might argue the max is the is the\nright number because I want to be able\nto\nsay if I can support him I can support\nanyone but there's also a downside to\nthat I've now engineered that product I\nYou could argue that I shall shall I I\nsay over engineered that\nproduct I'm sorry fact of safy a factory\nof safety okay all right so let's\nsuppose that you are you are doing this\nfor a\nmattress you all sleep on mattresses\nwe're all relatively wealthy based on\nthe fact that we're here so we probably\nsleep on a\nmattress not everyone's fortunate enough\nto sleep on a mattress but let's suppose\nyou do sleep on a mattress how much\nweight should that mattress be designed\nto Bear if you over engineer it what\nwill happen happen is that number one\nfor for for a reasonable weight let's\nsay weight a lot below that that\nmattress is not going to\nsink let's say that you design it for\n100 kilos now if you have 50 kilos or 60\nkilos that mattress is not going to sink\nfor you because it's going to feel\ncomfortable for someone who is 100 kilos\nand for someone who's 50 kilos you're\njust going to bounce on\nit you're going to feel it soft\nsilkiness or whatever it is you want to\nfeel from the mattress it won't work\nso what to\ndo that's a hard problem it's a\ndescription but it's a hard problem who\ndo I Engineer\nfor and so therefore uh people have\ndifferent ranges of what I mean to\nrepresent it so here's one version of it\nthis is what is called a fiveo summary I\nreport out the minimum the 25% point the\n50% point the 75 % point and\nthe maximum variable by variable I\nreport five\nnumbers I report the\nlowest what does 25%\nmean 25% of my data set or the people\nare younger than\n24 the youngest is\n18 25% or a quarter of them are between\n18 and\n24 a quarter are between 2 24 and\n26 a quarter between 26 and 33 and a\nquarter are between 33 and\n50 this is what is known as a\ndistribution this is what is known as a\ndistribution statisticians love\ndistributions they capture the\nvariability in the data and they do all\nkinds of things with it so I'm going to\ndraw typical shape of a\ndistribution we'll we'll make more sense\nof it later on this is a theoretical\ndistribution distribution for example\nlet's say has has a\nminimum has a\nmaximum has say 25% Point has a 50%\npoint it say 75% point in terms of\nprobabilities there's 25% here 25% here\n25% here 25% here if you want to think\nin terms of pure description this is not\na probability it's just a\nproportion if you want to think in terms\nof probabilities what this means is that\nout of 180 out of 180 people if I draw\none person at\nrandom if I draw one person at random\nthere's a 25% chance that that person's\nweight is going to be\nbelow below\n24 sorry age 24 correct if you want to\nthink in terms of probabilities we'll do\nthat\ntomorrow but this is a\ndescription so what this description\ndoes is it gives you an idea\nas to what value to use in which\nsituation so for example you could\nsay that I'm going to use 20\n26 as my representative\nage if I do that what is the logic I'm\nusing this this 25% this 50% point so to\nspeak this is called the\nmedian\nthis is called the median and we'll see\nit median means the age of the average\nperson first\ns take the middle person and ask how old\nare\nyou the age of the average person I\ncould also ask for the average age AG of\nthe\nperson which is what which is the\nmean which is 1 /\nn X1 + xn now this is\nalgebra what you have to do is you have\nto put n equal to\n180 this is the first age the second age\nthe third age up to\n180 1 by 180\nage\n1 plus age 11\n18 this is called the mean this value is\nwhat 28.7\nn the average age is about 28 years or\n28 and a half years 28.8 years but the\nage of the average person is 26 yes so\ncan you please repeat the median and the\nthe difference between the\ntwo describe what is the age of the\nperson so I described the median as the\nage of the average\nperson and I describe the mean as the\naverage age of a\nperson now he's looking at me like\nsaying you have to be kidding me right\nthat's\nconfusing I admit to it the easy way to\nunderstand it could be this what is the\nmean add them all up divide by how many\nthere are what is the median sort them\nfrom the smallest to the largest pick\noff the\nmiddle if they're an even number what do\nyou do you take the average of the two\nmiddle ones if they're the same it'll be\nthe same number if they're not it'll be\na number between\nthem so sometimes the median may show up\nwith a 0. five or something like that\nfor that reason if there is an ing\ncounts but there are an even number of\ncounts now which do you think is\nbetter dep you're giving the right\nanswer it depends you'll figure out that\nI like that\nanswer they both make sense they both\nmake sense it depends on what what\ncontext you're going to use it\nfor in certain case yes you said that\nMed basically the mean of the it's it's\nthe it's the age of the average person\nit's a reading from the average person\nso what is the parameter we are saying\nit is average person how we are getting\nthat aage okay if you're talking in\nterms of parameters so he used an\ninteresting term he's saying what is the\nparameter I'm after parameter is an\ninteresting word parameter refers to\nsomething what generally in a population\nit's an unknown thing that I'm trying to\nget after for example blood sugar is a\nparameter it exists\nbut I don't know it I'm trying to get my\nhandle on\nit correct so if I'm thinking in terms\nof of of\nparameters then these are different\nparameters so let's let's look at a\ndistribution here I'm not sure whether\nthis will pick up things I hope\nso so the median is the is the median is\na parameter such\nthat on this side I have 50%\nand on this side I have\n50% this is the\nmedian the\nmean is what is called the first moment\nwhat that means is think of this as a\nplate of\nmetal and I want to balance it on\nsomething where do I put my finger so\nthat it balances it is the CG of the\ndata the center of gravity of the\ndata\nyou can understand the difference\nbetween these two now if for example I\npush the data out to the right what\nhappens to the median nothing happens to\nthe median because the 50/50 split\nRemains the Same but if I push the data\nout to the right the mean will change\nit'll move to the right your lever the\nlever principle right if there's more\nweight on one side I have to move my\nfinger in order to counterbalance that\nweight so these are two different\nparameters if the distribution for\nexample is what is called symmetric\nsymmetric means it looks the same on the\nleft as on the right then these two will\nequal because the idea of going half to\nthe left and half to the right will be\nthe same as the idea of where do I\nbalance because the left is equal to the\nright so when the mean is not equal to\nthe median that's a signal that the left\nis not equal to the\nright and when the mean is a little more\nthan the median it says that there is\nsome data that has been pushed to the\nright\nand that should be something that you\ncan guess here because the mean and the\nmedian to some extent are what 24 26 Etc\nthe lowest is 18 that's about six 6\nyears 8 years less than that but what is\nthe\nmaximum 50 that's 25 years beyond the\ndata is pushed to the right a little\nbit instead of saying push to the right\nthe right technical term is Right\nskewed there are there are shall I say\npeople are more not\naverage on the on the older side than on\nthe younger side there was a hand up\nsomewhere I was just confused with the\nstatement that Medan would not move but\nthen you explain yes so so therefore one\nreason that the median often doesn't\nmove is because it is not that sensitive\nto\noutliers so let's suppose for example we\nlook at us us and we ask ourselves what\nis our mean income or median income and\nwe have that each of us make a certain\namount of money we can sort that up and\nset and put that in now let's suppose\nthat Mr mukes am money walks into the\nroom now what is going to happen to\nthese\nnumbers mean is going to go up right he\nalone probably makes a very large\nmultiple of all our incomes put together\npossibly I don't know how much you make\nI know how much I\nmake but what's going to happen to the\nmedian it's going to stay almost almost\nthe same the typical person may move by\nat most\nhalf because what is the typical person\ngoing to be the typical person is going\nto be an actual individual in the room\nor maybe an average of two individuals\nin the\nroom and that person is not going to\nchange\nyes yes that's that's one conclusion we\ncan draw draw on this there are other\nplots below which will also show the\nsame thing you're not being able to draw\nthat conclusion good logical reason I\nhaven't shown you the full data we'll\nsee the histogram we'll do that so hold\non to that\nquestion the conclusion was drawn is\nthat there are two pieces there are two\nthings to do see here one is if I simply\nlook at this without seeing any more\nGraphics where is the middle of the data\nfrom a median perspective at\n26 correct now from 26 look at the\ndifference between 26 and the\nsmallest 18 between 18 and 26 that's 8\nyears this 8 years contains 90\nobservations because there's 180 total\nnow what is on the opposite side of this\n26 to 50 that's how many years 24 24 24\nyears this 24 years now contains how\nmany observations same\n90 so there are 90 observations that are\nbetween 18 and\n26 and there are 90 observations between\n26 and 50 so if I were to draw a picture\nwhat would what would that picture look\nlike yes exactly as you're drawing it\nright we can say on left this usually by\ndefinition is called right\nskewed this is a problem that bab has\ndoes this mean it's left skewed or right\nskewed as a word right it's called right\nskewed more data to the\nright sorry more data is a dangerous\nword huh no that's it's the same number\nof observations I'll say the data is\npushed to the\nright more variation or right more\nvariation on the right side is probably\na safer way of putting it yes so\nskewness is often measured in various\nthings one measure of skewness is\ntypically for example mean minus median\nmean minus median if it is\npositive it usually corresponds ress\nmean minus median negative usually\ncorresponds to left\nskewness this is a statistic iCal rule\nbut sometimes it is used as a definition\nfor\nskewness there are many definitions for\nskewness skewed data sometimes causes\ndifficulties in analysis because what\nhappens is the idea of variation\nchanges being variation on one side\nmeans something really different than\nvariation from the other side um by the\nway um what's happening to you with\nrespect to things like books are you\ngetting books are you not getting books\nare you have no idea what the books\nare you got one book which is\nwhat which is the statistics book okay\nI'll take a look at that book later so\nthis book right okay show me the\nbook\nokay comment one very nice book comment\ntwo not a python\nbook right that doesn't make it a bad\nbook so if you're looking for help on\nhow to code things\nup this is not the right\nbook get a book like think stats or\nsomething like\nthat but if you want to understand the\nstatistics side to it it's an excellent\nbook so everything that I'm talking\nabout is going to be here I might talk\nabout which chapters and things like\nthat at some\npoint and I might talk about how to use\nthis in the book so for example at the\nback of this book there are lots in\nthere are\ntables there are tables at the back of\nthis book which we'll learn how to use\nand then I'll try to convince you that\nyou shouldn't use them\nbut remember many of these methods are\ndone in ways in which either you don't\nhave access to\ncomputers or if you do have access to\ncomputers you don't have them shall we\nsay at\nruntime in other words when I want to\nrun the application on it I can build a\nmodel using a computer but I can't run\nit within\none the runtime environment for\nstatistics is often done when there are\nno computers around\nthe build environment can include\ncomputers but the runtime environment\ncannot a lot of Statistics is done under\nthat kind of\nsituation even\nprobability yes very much so very much\nso okay so definitions of skewness and\nthings like that do it do it in the way\nyou usually use a book which means you\ngo to the index and see if the word is\nthere and then you go back and figure it\nout and it'll give you some ideas as to\nhow that works it's it's a nice book\nit's one of the best best books that you\nhave in business statistics but it's not\nnecessarily a book that will tell you\nhow to code things up that is not a\ndeficiency of the book not every book\ncan do things of that sort there are\nother books around that will tell you\nhow to quote things up but will not\nexplain what you are doing it's\nimportant to know what you are doing\nit's also important to know why you're\ndoing\nit but books can't be written with often\neverything in mind yes can you suggest\nsome book that which tell us how we can\nthink that way the thinking is here I\nthink this is good for thinking I I\nwould absolutely recommend this book on\nthe thinking side because the problem is\nlies that in which situation what we\nneed to yes and that answer I think is\nvery very good here where you won't get\nis it'll say do this and it won't give\nyou the python syntax to do it that that\nwill not be here so if you can solve\nthat problem through some other\nmeans I used to have a colleague in in\ncorporate life who had a very big\nsticker on his board it said Google\nsearch is not\nresearch right now nobody agrees with\nhim\nanymore so I suppose that when in doubt\nyou do what normal Homo sapiens do today\nwhich is you Google for an\nanswer so one possibility is that you ex\nyou you you understand something from a\nbook such as this and if you want to\nunderstand the syntax just Google for\nthe term say python that term whatever\nit'll probably give you the code things\nare very well organized these\ndays uh there's also the question and I\nshould give you a very slight warning\nhere not to not to discourage you from\nanything but in the next 9 months or\nthereabouts the the duration of your\nprogram there's going to be a fair\namount of material that will be thrown\nat\nyou correct the look and feel will\nsometimes be like what we would what we\nwould often call it MIT as drinking from\na fire\nhorse you can if you want\nto but you'll get very wet\nso therefore pick your battle if you\nwant to understand the statistic side of\nit please please go into the depth of it\nbut if you try to get into equal depth\non every topic that you want to learn\nthat will take up a lot of your\nprofessional\ntime now the reason we do the statistics\nfor first one it's it's a little easier\nfrom a computational perspective\nalthough harder from a conceptual\nperspective so we begin it this way but\nhold on to that idea and then as you\nkeep going know see if this is something\nthat you want to learn more on and if\nyou can you're welcome just write to us\nor let us know or let anyone know that\nis just coming let her know and we'll\nget the references to you but if you\nwant to for say for the first few\nresidencies please read the book and see\nwhat happens if there are doubts yes but\nit's it's a well-written book it's in\nit's it's instructor is one of our\ncolleagues here you know if you want we\ncan also help explain\nthings\nso this is the summary what did the\nsummary tell you the summary gave you\nwhat's called the five numbers five\nnumbers that help you describe the data\nminimum 25 50 75 Max we'll see another\ngraphical description of this it also\ndescribed for you a mean there is also\nanother number here and this is this\nnumber is indicated by the letters\nSTD STD refers to standard deviation\nSD refers to\nstandard\ndeviation and what is the formula for a\nstandard\ndeviation STD is equal\nto the square root\nof\nlittle bit of a\nmess but Two Steps step one calculate\nthe\naverage step two take the distance from\nthe average for every\nobservation ask the question how far is\nevery data point from The\nMiddle if it is very far from the middle\nsay that the deviation is more if it is\nnot far from the middle say that the\ndeviation is less deviation being used\nas a synonym for variation I'm talking\nabout variation variation can be more or\nvariation can be\nless more than the average less than the\naverage if someone is much older than\naverage there's variation if someone is\nmuch younger than average there is\nvariation so therefore both of these are\nvariation so what I do is when I take\nthe difference from the average I Square\nit so more than xar becomes positive\nless than xar also becomes\npositive then I add it up and I average\nit there's a small question as to why it\nis n minus one and that is because I'm\nI'm Divi I'm taking a difference from an\nobservation that is already taken from\nthe\ndata now if I've squared when I have\nsquared my original unit was in\nage when I have squared this has become\nage\nsquared so I take the square root in\norder to get my measure back into the\nscale of years so the standard deviation\nis a measure of how spread a typical\nobservation is from the\naverage it is a standard deviation where\na deviation is how far from the average\nyou\nare and because of this squaring you\nneed to work with a square\nroot in in in sort of modern machine\nlearning people sometimes use something\ncalled a mean absolute deviation mad mad\nvery optimistically\ncalled so what mad is is if you don't\ntake a square you take an absolute\nvalue and then you do not have a square\nroot outside\nit and that is sometimes used as a\nmeasure\nof how much variability there\nis so why it is squ why is it why we do\njust we Square it because we want to\nlook at both positive and negative\ndeviations if I didn't Square it what\nwould happen is it would cancel out what\nwas the word that one of you used\nneutralize right I love that term your\npositive deviations would neutralize\nyour negative\n[Music]\ndeviations\nyes seen the posi and thetive this\nnumber is going to be positive if say X1\none so let's look at the first number\nhere so if I look at the head command\nhere when I did the head command here\nwhat did the what did the head command\ngive me the first few observations now\nthis is an\n18yearold this probably sorted by H this\nis an 18y old correct now I'm try I'm\ntrying to explain the variability of\nthis data with respect to this 18y old\nwhat is the what is the what why is\nthere variation this 18 number is not\nthe same as 28 and 18 is less than 28 so\nwhat what I want to do is I want to go\n18\nminus 28.7 what I'm interested in is\nthis\n10 this 10e difference between the\ntwo now the person the oldest person in\nthis data set is how old 50 when I get\nto that row this 50 will also differ\nfrom this 28 by 22\nyears so I'm interested in that 10 and\nI'm interested in the\n22 I'm not interested in the minus - 10\nor a minus\n22 we can I can do that I can do that in\nother words what I can do is I can look\nat I can represent 18 - 28 as 10 and I\ncan represent 28 - 50 as 22 and that is\nthis as I said 1 / n -1 absolute X1 -\nxar plus plus absolute xn - xar that is\nthis with n minus one and this is done\nas I'm saying this is what is called\nmean absolute\ndeviation and many machine learning\nalgorithms\nuse this you are correct in today's\nworld this is\nsimpler now when standard deviations\ncame up first this was actually a little\nharder but people did argue about\nthis I think well 150 maybe more abouts\nI forget my history that much there were\ntwo famous mathematicians one named ga\nand one name\nllas who argued as to whether to use\nthis or whether to use\nthis laas said you should use this and\ngaus said you should use now the reason\ngaus won was simply because gaus found\nit easier to do\ncalculations why is this easier to\ncalculate\nwith because Newton had come up with\nCalculus you know a century or so before\nthat and so for example let's that you\nwant to minimize variability which is a\nwhich is some something that we often\nneed to do in analytics which means you\nneed to minimize things with standard\ndeviation which means you need to\ndifferentiate this function the the\nsquare function is differentiable you\ncan minimize it using calculus this is\nnot so therefore what happened was gaus\ncould do\ncalculations but laas could not and laas\nlost and gaus won the definition of the\nstandard deviation\nwe haven't much used 25% or 75 so as in\nas in\nokay why do we not do that\nso today this entire argument makes no\nsense because today how do we minimize\nanything our computer program you don't\nuse any\ncalculus you ask you run fmen or\nsomething of that sort you basically run\na program to do it\nso therefore this argument that's you\ncan both do calculations equally well\nwith this as in as in that so today what\nis happening is that lass's way of\nthinking is being used more and more\nthis one is a lot less sensitive to\noutliers this one what it does is if it\nis far away the 22 squares to 484 or\nsomething like that which is a large\nnumber so the standard deviation is is\nis often driven by very large deviances\nlarger the devian the more it blows\nup and so therefore this is often very\ncriticized if you read for example the\nfinance literature there's a guy called\nTalib Nasim Talib he writes his book\ncalled the black Swann and Fool by\nRandomness where he left and right\ncriticized the standard deviation as a\nmeasure of\nanything so today this argument doesn't\nmake a great deal of sense and when in\npractice something like this makes sense\nit's often\nused so a lot of this is done\nhistorically it it looks this way\nbecause of a certain um\nhistorical definition and then it's\nnot it's hard to\nchange so today in in you know centuries\nafter gaus sad people like me are trying\nto explain it having trouble doing\nit because there's a logic to it right I\nmean and that logic doesn't hold at all\nanymore now yes in simple terms is that\n18 how far generally is that from the\nmedum how far how far on the\naverage is an observation from the\naverage confusing statement again he's\ngoing to be\nunhappy but how far on the average is an\nobservation from the average if that\nanswer is zero that means everything is\nat the\naverage but you asking the question how\nfar from the average is it is an\nobservation on the average if I take\nyour blood pressure how far from your\naverage blood pressure is this\nreading if this is exactly equal then I\ndon't need to worry about variability\nevery time I measure blood pressure I'll\nsee the same\nthing what is your average bank balance\ndon't tell me that but but but you know\nwhat I mean right you have an average\nbank\nbalance your your bank account manager\nor your bank actually tracks this what\nyour average bank balance\nis but you're not actually your B\nbalance is almost never or very very\nrarely equal to your actual average bank\nbalance it's more and it's\nless how much more how much less is\nsomething that the bank is also\ninterested in in order to try and figure\nout you know how much of your money so\nto speak to get out\nthere because the bank is going to make\nmoney by lending it out correct but when\nit lends it out it can't give it to\nyou so it makes an assessment as to how\nmuch money it's I don't want to get into\nFinance now but you get the drift\nH so\ntherefore then it is a measure of that\nit is not the only measure of that so\nfor example here's another measure so\nyou remember this 25 number and the 75\nnumber that you're asking about let's\nsay that I calculate a number that looks\nlike this let's say\n33\nminus let's say 33 is a 75% Point minus\n24 so 33 - 24 let's say this is my 24\nand this is my 33 between this how much\ndata\nlies\n50% why because this is 25% and this is\n25% this now contains 50% this is\nsometimes called the inter quartile\nrange inter quartile range big word\nright now why is it called an inter\nquartile range the reason is because\nsometimes this is called Q3 and this is\ncalled q1 Q3 stands for upper\nquartile you can understand quartile\nquarter so upper\nquarter and this is the lower\nquartile and the difference between the\nupper quartile and the lower quartile is\nsometimes called the inter quartile why\nis it called the range because what is\nthe actual range of the data the range\nof the data in this particular case is\n50 minus\n18 and 50us 18 which is your max minus\nyour Min this is simp sometimes simply\ncalled the\nrange range is maximum minus minimum\ninter quartile range is upper quartile\nminus\nlower quartile and these measures are\nused they do see certain uses based on\ncertain\napplications you can see certain\nadvantages to this for example let's\nsuppose that I calculate my five point\nsummary with my five point summary I can\nnow give you a measure of location which\nis my\nmedian and I can give you two measures\nof dispersion which is my interquartile\nrange and my\nrange so those five five numbers have\nnow been\nTwisted to give me a summary number\nwhich is the\nmedian and a range\nnumber interestingly I can also draw\nmental conclusions from that for example\nI can draw conclusions from these five\nnumbers in the following way 24 and\n33 half my customers are between 22 and\n24 and\n33\nso if I want to deal with half my\ncustomers I need to be able to deal with\na range of about 9 years within this 9\nyears is all that I'm interested to get\nthis right so if I'm building my if I'm\nbuilding my my my machine I'm going to\nmake sure let's say that the 33y old is\nokay with this and the 24 year old is\nokay with\nthis will the 50-year-old be okay with\nthis no may not be\nbut if I want to make the 50-year-old\nokay with this I'll have trouble with\nthe\n18-year-old so I can do a lot with even\nthese five\nnumbers we'll see more descriptive\nstatistics as we go\nalong by the way this is only for age I\ncan do this for you know usage I can do\nthis for Fitness I can do this for\nincome I can do this for Miles income is\ninteresting here's the median income\n$50,000 and the mean income about\n$53,000 if you see income in almost all\nreal cases the mean income is going to\nbe more than the median\nincome the per capita income of India is\nmore than the income of the typical\nIndian see what does this command do if\nI say my data. info what this is doing\nis my data first of all is a data frame\nthat I created just to review I read the\nPDF file this way now this is a\ndescribe and this here is info now\ndescribe and info in the English\nlanguage are similar things description\nand\ninformation and this is interpreted in\nthe software is two completely different\nthings information is like your variable\nsetting it's like your integer field\nyour real field it's setting like that\nit's giving you information on the data\nas\ndata the word data means different\nthings to different people to a\nstatistician data means\nwhat to a statistician data means a\nnumber to an IT professional what does\ndata\nmean bytes information you know I've\nlost my data I don't particularly care\nwhat the data is I've lost my data so\nthis is that information it tells you\ntells you about the data it's an object\nit's a description it's a 64-bit stored\ninteger it's an object so it tells you\nabout numeric\ncategorical it tells you about the kind\nof data that's available nonnull fields\nin other words there are objects in the\nfield\nEtc there are so many integer types\nwhich are stored at 64 because this\ncomputer is probably capable at 64 and\nthere are three categorical\nvariables this is a this is shall we say\na data object summary of the of what is\nthere in that data frame not a\nstatistical\nsummary useful in its own\nway particularly if you're processing it\nand storing it for those of you who are\ngoing to go into Data um sort of\ncuration like carers this kind of a\ndatabase is a\nnightmare because typically what happens\nis when you store real data you in in\naddition to data you often store what's\ncalled a data\ndictionary sometimes that's referred to\nas metadata data about the data because\nsimply storing a bunch of numbers is not\nenough you have to say what the numbers\nare about this adds a layer of\ncomplexity to the metadata you now have\nto store not only what the varable is\nabout but what kind of a variable it is\nso many professional organizations say\nis that archival data should never be a\nmixture of both numerical and\ncategorical objects and they pay a price\nfor that numerical things should become\ncategorical or categorical Things become\nnumerical but what happens is if you are\nstoring large volumes of It And\narchiving it and making it available for\npeople who have not seen it before it\nsometimes gets convenient so therefore\nfees like this are often useful to see\nhow big a problem you have\nright now I want to plot a few things to\nplot you can plot anything Sion I think\nis coming a little\nlater but this\nplot this is from M plot\nlibrary and it is plotting through a\ncommand called\nhist hist\nmeans histogram which you've already\nseen you've covered his histograms right\nI think we seen histograms so this is a\nhistogram now histogram as a\nsyntax has bin sizes and figure\nsizes so what you can do is you can play\naround with these and see the\ndifferences in what this histogram does\nbut there's a certain default that shows\nup and that default is quite good and\nhere is a histogram distribution of the\nage this is not a set of numbers this is\na\npicture this is a picture what does this\npicture have this picture has a set of\nbins and it has a set of counts within\neach\nbins between these two numbers between\nsay 10 and whatever this is let's say 22\nor thereabouts I have a count of let's\nsay\n17 so it gives a count and it does this\nby getting a sense of how many bins\nthere are and plotting this shape it's a\nlittle bit of an arc to write a\nhistogram\nprogram there there's a there's a python\nbook out there I think things chatter\none of it in which sort of the first\nonethird of the book is basically how to\nwrite a histogram code It's a Wonderful\nbook but because it treats this example\nit got terrible\nreviews reviewer said why do I want to\nlearn how to code a\nhistogram and the book's author is I'm\nteaching you how to write a code a\nhistogram is an is an example of how to\ndo that and I tend to agree if you want\nto test yourself of your understanding\nof data and your understanding of any\nprogramming language and any\nvisualization language quote a histogram\nin\nit and have\nfun so so it's it's a nice Challenge\nfrom many perspectives the data\nchallenge the language challenge the\nvisualization challenge all of that yes\nso you said Aral data should be\nnumerical many companies do that that\nthey that they want archival dat data to\nbe have only one data form only one\nformat why is that so because as I said\nwhen you store data how do you store it\nlet's say that you've generated an\nanalysis the analysis is done correct\nand you've decided not to destroy the\ndata you're going to keep the data in\nyour company's databases or in your own\ndatabase how will you keep it you can\ntake a technology let's let's let's pick\nan example let's say what's pick an\nexample SQL Excel whatever let's say\nExcel let's say I keep it in Excel now\nif I keep it in Excel what will I now do\nso let's say I have an Excel spreadsheet\nlet's say my cardio data set let's say\nthis data set now in addition to the\ndata what do I need to store with\nit\ninformation yes metadata how do I store\nthat metadata yes so one possibility is\nI can have a text file like that like I\nhad at the top of this describing all of\nthis which is typically what happens in\nExcel storage it describes this and it\ndescribes there's one file calledd and\nanother file called descript or\nsomething of that sort which basically\ndescribes the variables and the idea is\nthat they have the same name and one\nextension gives you the data the other\nextension gives you the description of\nthe variables that are in this\ndata correct now this is good now what's\ngoing to happen on that data certain\ncode has been\nrun that code is going to assume certain\nthings about the\ndata what do you want that code to\nassume about that\ndata whatever you want that code to\nassume about that data should be\navailable in the data\ndictionary now if that code is stable\nenough to realize that whatever Fields\nyou give me I will run on that's cool\nbut if that Cod requires you to know\nwhat kind of data is being used let's\nsay discrete data let's say continuous\ndata in the future you'll be doing\nthings like linear regression logistic\nregression linear regression will make\nsense if the variable is a number\nlogistic regression will make sense if\nthe variable is a zero or a\none if you have that problem now in the\nmetadata you need to be able to tell not\nonly what business information this\nvariable contains but also what kind of\na computational object it is so the code\ncan\nrun so therefore what people often say\nis that I'm going to make it very simple\nand I'm going to assume that my entire\ndata frame consists of only one kind of\nvariable so that when I run any\nalgorithm on it I know EX ly what kind\nof data input that algorithm is going to\nget but I'm saying it's a practical\nanswer that many companies often often\nhave and I've worked in a couple of\ncompanies at at least one company where\nthis was very seriously done so we had\nto we had to when we put data back in we\nhad to convert it and for in the\nsituation that I was in it wanted\neverything in categories so what we\nwould do is we would take continuous\ndata and we would do what's called Fine\nclassing which means that we would\ndivide not into four pieces but into 10\npieces desile one desile 2 desile 3\ndesile 4 up to desile 1 and every\nvariable was stored now not in its\noriginal numbers but as 10 9 8 7654321\nso let's suppose that I tell his income\nis n what that means is I know he's in\nthe ninth\ndesde 10% of the people or more have\nincome more than him 80% have less than\nhim he's in that bracket and all\nvariables were stored that way now what\nhappens is every algorithm knows that\nevery variable is going to be stored\nthat\nway and you can keep writing algorithms\nthat way otherwise what would have to\nhappen is every algorithm will need to\nbe differently and let's say you're\ndoing credit scoring let's say you're\ndoing CRM models you're doing something\nof this sort and youve built a very\nsophisticated CRM model that tracks your\ncustomers and it works now suddenly\nyou've got a new variable coming in the\nTwitter\nfeed and suddenly nothing\nworks what to do go back and rebuild\nthat entire model\nthat's going to set you back 3 4 months\nthat's going to set you back a few\nthousand so you say no any variable that\nhas to go in has to go in in this form\nand if it goes into this form my\nalgorithm can deal with it so when in\nsuch case it might not affect the I mean\nthe efficiency of the model that we\ngenerate yes yes and in practice I'm\ngoing far away from topic now in\npractice an profession analyst has to\nstruggle between doing the right thing\nbadly and the wrong thing\nwell you want to do the right thing well\nbut the right thing well is going to\ncost you time money data and\neverything so you struggle between\nsaying\nthat I'm going to get a flawed model\nquickly built on a new data set or I'm\ngoing to get an inefficient answer on a\nModel that's already been built and\nlet's see how far it\ngoes and so these are more cultural\nissues with how an an analytical\nsolution is often deployed in companies\nthey vary very much from industri to\nIndustry they vary very much from um\ncompany to company from the culture of a\ncompany to a culture of company they\ndepend on regulatory environments in\ncertain environments an auditor like\nentity comes in and insists on seeing\nyour data show me your data let's say in\nfinances is sometimes happening regulat\nagency let's say Reserve Bank of India\ngoes into a bank and says show me your\ndata all this npas Etc show me your\norder book show me your loan\nbook correct and now that has to be done\nand the decisions you made have to be\ndone in a way that is patently clear why\nyou have done this so very often people\nsay I don't want to make the best risk\ndecision I want to make the most obvious\nrisk\ndecision which may not be the same thing\nat\nall but I'm being\naudited\nso that's a practical question and and I\ndon't have a clean answer to that but I\ndo know what\nhappens is it\nright\nno it's\nnot\nbut we live in a world that has that\nkind of imperfection my one of my\nteachers his name was Jerry Friedman\nyou'll see some of his work later on he\ncame up with algorithms like projection\nPursuit cart Mars gradient boosting he\ncreated many of the algorithms that\nyou'll be studying one of my teachers at\nStanford when he ran our Consulting\nclasses he would say this solve the\nproblem assuming you had an infinitely\nsmart client and an infinitely fast\ncomputer after you've done that solve\nthe real\nproblem when you do not have an\ninfinitely smart client and you do not\nhave an infinitely fast computer this\nwas in the early 1990s where computer\nspeeds were a lot slower\nand we didn't have powerful machines\nlike this\naround so a lot of this is done in in\nthat kind of situation where where you\nare uh where you struggling for\ncontinuity when you're figuring it out\nimagine yourself as an analytics manager\nand I hope many of you will be and you\nhave an analytics team sitting in front\nof you correct you're looking at them\nand you're looking at them in the eye\nand you know how much you're paying them\nand you know that half of them are going\nto leave at the end of the year\nwhat are you going to do with regard to\nthe modeling and things like\nthat your first order of business is\ngoing to be to ensure continuity in some\nform keep it simple\nright keep it simple keep it obvious for\nthe next bunch of people who are going\nto come in and for that you'd be willing\nto trade a little bit of make it\nright so now the new person coming in\nwill now not want to solve a very\ncomplicated kind of situation this is\nnot where you want to be but and I do\nnot want to depress you on day one but\nit's also the fun part of the profession\nright it's also what makes\nit interesting and sort of interesting\nand exciting right it's not all bad okay\nso the histogram command summaries of\nwhat these histograms are and each gives\nyou a sense of what the distribution is\nand as you can see from most of these\npictures most of these variables when\nthey do have a skew tend to have a right\nskew maybe education has a little bit of\na left\nskew maybe education a little bit of a\nleft CU that a few people are educated\nand most people are here but even\n[Music]\nso right now here's an interesting\nplot\num mro life has this as well but seor\nhas a better version of it this is\nwhat's called a box plot you've seen a\nbox plot\nthere's a box\nplot um people are unsure as to where\nthis box came\nfrom because there's a transtion called\nbox who's used this before but this box\ncame from it used to be called a box and\nwhisker plot these are the\nwhiskers this whisker will go this is\nthis is the\nmedian this is the upper quartile the\ntop edge of the\nBox the bottom edge of the box is the\nlower\nquartile the end of the\nwhisker is 1.5 times the interquartile\nrange above the\nbox right if you want a\nformula s of the whisker the length of\nthe whisker is 1.5\n*\nIQR should I have a break now a little\nbit maybe\nhuh so we okay 345 whatever we'll go\nafter there\nLe yeah I haven't stopped I just got\ndistracted\nso 1.5 *\nthe if so it goes up to that if a point\nlies outside\nit the point is shown outside\nit if the data ends before\nit the whisker also\nends\ncorrect what is the whisker okay what is\nthe\nwhisker all right let me explain another\nway the whisker is the\nmaximum the top of the whisker is the\nmaximum the bottom of the whisker is the\nminimum\nokay not okay\nokay some of the points are outside\nso this point here now what is this plot\nhere age for males so what this means is\nthis is the minimum 18 or whatever it is\nand this is the maximum 48 or whatever\nit is minimum the maximum so if you see\nnothing else on the box plot no other\npoints other than just the box and the\nwhisker then your five point summary is\nsitting\nthere that's it right now what happens\nif you see points like\nthis outliers what is an outlier an\noutlier is a point that lies more than\n1.5 times the interquartile range above\nthe box so this whisker will not extend\nindefinitely it'll go up to 1.5 times\nthis\nbox and then it'll stop and if any\npoints are still left outside it it'll\nshow them as\ndots you can treat this as a definition\nfor what an outlier\nis same\nthing same thing in the other direction\nthe logic is\nsymmetric no no that means this it\nhasn't it's the data is ended here the\ndata the data is ended here is was there\nany other number tried instead of 1. I\nsuppose so and you can change it you can\nI won't try it now but you can go to the\nbox plus syntax and change that\nso you can go to boxplot syntax and you\ncan change that\n1.5 it's not hardcoded into the\nalgorithm I'm I'm I'm I think 95% sure\nas statistician I'm never sure about\nanything but but I\nbut but it's it's it's a parameter in\nthe in in in the uh you should be able\nto pass the parameter in the Box\nfunction default is\n1.5 you should be able to change it\nand what's the color part that's the\nmedi which one the color\ncoloror oh no these these two colors\nthese two colors are because I've asked\nfor two\nthings I've asked for male and feale if\nI if I had three of them that's okay but\nhow\nthe the oh this this one here oh this is\nQ3 the lower is Q3 and the upper is\nsorry lower is q1 and the upper is Q3 so\nthis qu qu range so so for males between\nthe bottom bottom whisker to the end of\nthe box is a quarter of your data the\nbox is half your data and the top of the\nbox to the end of the whisker is quarter\nof your\ndata so the middle line is the middle\nline is the\nmedian the middle line is the median\nthere is also function inbox plot you\ncan play with where it'll give you a\nDOT and that dot is the a\nmean I mean you can you can you can ask\nboxplot to do that but but a mean is not\na general standard component in the\nfiveo\nsummary it's a different\ncalculation not a\nsort but if you want to you can make box\nplot to give a DOT on the mean as well\nby\ndefinition\nyes so so mean Medan so half the data is\nbetween um 24 and 34 or whatever that\nis half of all my all the men in my\nsample are between those two\nnumbers I think box plot doesn't allow\nyou to change the shape of the\nbox I think that is\nset that's sort of central to the idea\nof a box plot it does allow you to\nfiddle with the size of the whisker but\nI don't think it allows you to fiddle\nwith the size of a box in other words if\nyou change that to something else let's\nsay the 20% point to the 80% Point 80/20\nrule that's no longer a box\nplot it's another interesting plot the\nsignificance of it is exactly this as we\nhad seen before the significance of it\nis is that the data looks like\nthis it's right\nskewed think of the picture so this is\nyour q1 and this is your Q3 this is your\nQ2 or the median then the median is\ngoing to be closer to q1 than it is to\nQ3 in the same way that the minimum will\nbe closer to the median than the maximum\nsame idea this is a summarization for\nnumbers if you were to summarize for\ncategorical\ndata what's called a cross tab or a\ncross\ntabulation this is simply how many\nproducts are there\nproduct category 195 498 and 798 they've\ngot three kinds of treadmills and\nthey're trying to understand which who\nwas using what kind of treadmill our\nbusiness problem is to understand who\nwas using what products this is a cross\nstab what is this this is something that\nwill be used for categorical variables\nno box plot will make sense here there\nare no\nnumbers so now you can ask interesting\nquestions here if you want to and you\ncan think about how to answer it is that\nfor example you can ask a question is\nthere a difference between the\npreferences of men and\nwomen\npossibly is there a difference in the\nproducts that they\nthat irrespective of gender is there a\nproduct that that they\nprefer you can ask all kinds of\ninteresting questions and you can find\nways to answer it which we will do not\nin this residency but next time around\nfor those we can ciz it also categorize\nfor those preferences\nso this is simply once again this is\ndescriptive all this has done is it has\nsimply told you the data as it\nis what I'm saying is that if for this\nif you want to do a little more analysis\non it you now have to reach a conclusion\nbased on\nit so for example one conclusion to ask\nis is that is that do men and women have\nthe same preferences when it comes to\nthe fitness product they\nuse now that's a question to answer that\nquestion it's enough to look at the data\nbut just looking at it will not give me\nthe answer I need to be able to find a\nstatistic to figure that out a statistic\nthat does what that in some way measures\nthat\ndifference let's say measures the\ndifference between men and women or what\nwe will do is not measure that what\nwe'll do is we'll measure that if there\nwas no difference between men and women\nwhat should this table have looked\nlike\nand then we'll compare the difference\nbetween these counts and that\ntable but that's the interesting part of\na statistical statistic which we'll do\nthat's called a k Square test it's\ncoming up in the next residency but\nthat's the prediction part or the\ninference part of this description this\nis just the description you can do a\nsimilar thing\nhere this for example is for um marital\nstatus and\nproduct what product you\nuse are you not very dependent whether\nyou're partnered or sing what is marital\nprodct maybe it has to do with age or\nmaybe they're correlated should you use\none as opposed to the\nother\nokay right you can use counts as well if\nyou see instead instead of instead of\ndoing it this way instead of seeing it\nas a table if you want to see it as a\nplot you can ask for counts so there are\nthings like count plots and bar\nplots which allow you to do counts in\nthe lab you'll do probably a few more of\nthese this is simply another\nvisualization of the same\nthing uh for those of you who like\nthings like pivot tables in\nExcel\nh of Microsoft has made you know wonders\nof us\nall in corporate life they were I was\ntold that you know you can have um you\ncan have a master's in in in Bachelor\nmaster in anything engineering is good\nEtc and it's nice if you have if you\nhave you know phds in a few areas but\nwhat you really need is a PhD in\nPowerPoint\nengineering I mean that's a necessary\nqualification for\nSuccess so certain tools have been used\nso therefore those tools have been\nimplemented in many of these softwares\nas well this is the pivot table version\nof the same data set this is the last\nsort of not last but still this this is\na this is a plot uh let me show you this\nplot and then we'll end or we'll take a\nbreak this is a plot that is a very\npopular plot because it is a very lazy\nplot this plot requires extremely little\nthinking pair plot of a data\nframe right you don't care what the\nvariables\nare you're telling it nothing about the\nplots You're simply saying figure out a\nway to plot them Pair by\npair and it does\nthat so for example how would you read\nthis plot on this side so it creates a\nmatrix the rows are a variable and the\ncolumns are\nvariables what is\nthis this is age versus age age versus\nage makes no sense so what it plots\nthere is a histogram of age\ndoesn't like the Gap nature abols the\nvacuum I suppose python does as\nwell so it now\nplotter what it should have plot is age\nversus age you're right it should have\nbeen a 45° line H but a 45° line is a\nuseless graphic particularly if the same\n45° line shows up in the\ndiagonals so to make a more interesting\ngraphic it plots the histogram\nthere this\nanalysis this kind of analysis sometimes\nhas a name associated with it the name\nis\nunivariate univariate means I'm looking\nat it variable by variable one variable\nat a time when I'm looking at age I'm\nonly looking at age it's called\nunivariate analysis it's just a word uni\nas\nin uniform same form unicycle cycle with\none wheel things like that univ variant\nhuh unit but for the other set of data\nalso replicate the same kind of pattern\nif I'm going to give other set of data\nanother set of data it'll replicate the\nsame it'll replicate the same nature of\nthe data there'll be histogram here\nagain so yes so\nwhat it will do is remember that this\ngraph the nature of the graph so let's\nlet's see\nthis right so where is gender\nhere where is gender\nhere\nis it\nthere is gender is gender in my\ndata it is\nthere so when I did past plot my\ndata what did it do with\ngender yes remember in\ninfo when we did info here\nremember how it has stored the\ndata no not any\nhere so it had product gender and\nmarital status it had identified as\nobjects in the data\nframe when it had formed the data\nframe so now what does it tell you about\nthe about the\ncommand the pair plot\ncommand only yes it will it will ignore\nthose\nobjects so in answer to your question if\nthe data frame has been stored has been\ncaptured with integer 64 basically\nintegers or numerics in it it will\nplot if it's only objects he'll probably\ngive a null plot yeah\nhow\nsay again AG\nis why like that this is the histogram\nthis is the same plot this plot is the\nsame\nas which\nplot this one it's the same as this one\nhere age no this is not age versus age\nthis is just\nage age versus age would have been a 45°\nline but it's not plotting\nthat it's not plotting that in the\ndiagonal it is not plotting age versus\nage in the diagonal it is simply\nplotting AG's own\ndistribution yes with the count so what\nit is doing is it is essentially running\nhist on age all each observation and\nputting it on the diagonal yes what\ncan\n20 again there is a b there is a bin\nwhat can\nthat from each bin it's a count count of\npeople in that\nage it's a count of the number of people\nwho are in that age group here this is\nage no this\nmiles this is\nage this is age so say let's say between\nhere between uh let's say say\n40.5 and 43.5 whatever these numbers are\nthere are three people it's a remember\nthe histogram is a visual thing you can\ndatamine a histogram if you want to\nwhich means you can se you can find out\nwhat those are and you can see it inside\ninside histogram just ask for a summary\nof that it'll give you what the features\nare of that histogram but the histogram\nis not meant to be used that way it's\nmeant to be used as a as an optical\ndevice to see the shape to see the count\nit's an art to do a\nhistogram if you change the bins a\nlittle bit the histogram will look a\nlittle\ndifferent so I would suggest that unless\nyou've got a lot of experience in this\nor you really enjoy the programming do\nnot fiddle with the histogram it shape\nwill\nchange I'll show you a little later\nafter the break not change the histogram\nbut what shape\nis no not not in default you can go in\nand change it on\nsize but the bin width Etc the binwidth\nof histogram takes a little more to\nchange right so you can there's stuff\nout here you can find other things in\nwhich you can play\nthis so there are ways to do\nit okay so quickly ending we're losing\nour\nfood so these different plots and we'll\ncontinue after the break the rest of it\nis simply an X versus y so for example\nthis is age\nversus\neducation this is age versus education\nso the second graph from the first one\nis just rotated yes he's right if this\nis education on the Y AIS and age on the\nx-axis or vice versa then these two\nplots one and two and two and one are\njust mirrored images of each\nother a mirror image\nrot you right depends on where you look\nwhere you put the mirror but\nyes mirrors so I remember when I was a\nwhen I was a kid mirrors would confuse\nme so I would ask a question like this\nthat when I see a mirror left and right\ngets switched but top and bottom\ndon't I never understood\nwhy you\nknow huh due to gravity you can think I\nmean left and right gets switched but\ntop and bottom don't I thought it was\nsomething to do with a mirror and then I\nthought it was something to do with my\neyes you know maybe because they left so\nI looked at it this way and that didn't\nhelp so yes it's an important point when\nyou do symmetry it's a good catch it's a\ngood catch to realize that there aren't\nso many plots there actually only half\nas many plots because the plot on this\nside of histograms and the plot on the\nopposite side of histograms are the same\nthere was another question that one of\nyou asked is that many of these seem to\nlook like rows and columns\nin the sense that what are these rows\nnow what does this row look what does\nthis mean it means that this variable\nFitness this variable Fitness actually\nhas very few numbers in\nit it has a number 1 2 3 4 and five now\nwhy is that because remember how I\nDefine Fitness it's my perception of\nwhether I was fit or not in my original\ndefinition of the variable\nhere you go self-rated and fitness and\none to five scale where one is in poor\nshape and five is in excellent shape\nthis was the created data so in this\ndata set I now have that this variable\nin\nit these kinds of variables sometimes\ncause difficulty in the sense that there\nare some there's a word for it these are\nsometimes called ordinal variables so\nsometimes data is looked at sort of you\nknow\nnumerical and\ncategorical and categorical is sometime\ncalled\nnominal and\nordinal nominal\nmeans it's a\nname name of a person North Southeast\nand West gender male female Place Etc\nit's a variable essentially it's a name\nordinal is it's also categorical but\nthere is a sense of\norder there is a of order dissatisfied\nvery dissatisfied so there's an order\norder therefore\nordinal this variable the fitness\nvariable can if you wish be treated as\nan ordinal categorical\nvariable so for example the liquor scale\nis that so the seven point scale not\nsatisfied very dissatisfied dissatisfied\nmoderately dissatisfied neutral sat\nmoderately satisfied satisfied very\nsatisfied mark one this generates a data\nfrom a scale of say 1 to 7 or 0 to 6 so\nit'll show up in your database as a\nnumber like for example here you can say\ninstead of 1\nto5 very unfit moderately\nunfit\nokay relatively fit very fit instead of\ngiving one to five give it that way and\nyou code it up this way your choice so\nsometimes when you have data that looks\nlike\nthis the data the python or any database\nwill recognize it as a number because\nyou've entered it as a number but you\nanalyze it as if it is a\ncategory so the opposite problem also\nsometimes exists in that sometimes you\nget to see a categorical variable show\nup as a number but you know it's a\ncategorical variable a zip code is an\nexample a zip code shows up as a number\nbut it's obviously not\nyou can't add up zip\ncodes\nright you take two places in Bangalore\nand you want to find a place between\nthem that's not the average of the zip\ncodes it might be close but you can't do\narithmetic with zip codes the other\ndifficulty with zip codes is that they\ncan be many of them which means that as\nyour data set\ngrows the number of zip codes also grows\nso the number of values that a variable\ncan take grows with the data and this\nsometimes causes a difficulty because\nwhat happens is that in the statement of\nthe definition of the variable you now\ncannot State how many categories there\nwill be\npresent so you know that there will be\nmore zip codes coming you just don't\nknow how many more zip codes will be\ncoming but you also know it's a\ncategorical variable so you can't treat\nit like a number and so there are some\nspecial types of you know problems like\nzip codes that require special types of\nsolutions so the plot itself is a very\nvery computational plot if it recognizes\nit as a number it plots\nit if you don't want to make it plot as\na number change it to a character most\nsoftwares including python will allow\nyou to do\nthat now this is in some way a graphical\nrepresentation of it for the for the end\nof this session we can talk a little bit\nabout the numbers associated with it so\nhere for example my data age you can\nalso go you know do age if you want to\nand things like\nthat this is the\nmean um 27. 7888 is the mean so you can\nextract it there are functionalities of\nthe mean that can be that can be\nrecovered like trimming etc etc that if\nyou want to you can calculate the\nstandard deviation you remember the\nstandard deviation formula that strange\nformula that I wrote on the board this\nis the standard deviation formula if you\nwant to calculate the standard\ndeviation you can do this for other\nvariables as\nwell this is an interesting\nplot so I don't want to go too far into\nthis plot but it's an interesting plot\nright in\nseon there's a warning on the\ncode this is called or what they're\nreferring to is a distribution\nplot so this is a plot\nthat tries to look at not what the data\nis but what the distribution is so\nremember I was drawing these odd\npictures pictures like this and drawing\nlines on it those were\ndistributions so what he trying to do is\nit's trying to go after the distribution\nof the\ndata now what does this mean it means\nthat it says this it says that there is\nan underlying\ndistribution of the age variable this\ndistribution is a distribution you do\nnot\nknow however you have a sample from that\ndistribution how big a\nsample about 180\nobservations from that sample of\n180 can you guess at what that\ndistribution\nis in other words can you give me a\ncurve it's an answer to that\nproblem and it gives a\ncurve why is the raw data not\nenough so the raw data is not enough\nthen this goes to the heart of what the\nstatistical problem\nis is because I am interested not in the\nage of this particular group of\npeople I'm interested in the\ncorresponding age of another very\nsimilar group of people\nwhy what is the problem I'm trying to\nsolve I'm trying to solve the problem of\nwho is buying my cardiac equipment now\nwhen are these people going to buy my\ncardiac\nequipment at some point in time okay now\nwhat is my\ndata but for whom is this data who have\nI got the data\nfor people already right people have\nalready bought so I have a problem my\nproblem is I want to reach a conclusion\nabout my future\ncustomers based on my old\ncustomers how to do\nthis what mathematical logic allows me\nto say something about the\nfuture based on the\npast yes in short the way to do this is\nto assume that there is what is called a\npopulation we'll talk more later at this\nstage to assume a\ndistribution to assume that there is a\ndistribution from this\ndistribution I have seen a\nsample today from this distribution I'll\nsee a sample\ntomorrow the people are not the\nsame because the people who are going to\nuse my cardiac experiment cardiac\nequipment yesterday are not what going\nto use it next year if it was a same I\nnever have a growing\nbusiness there's no point analyzing data\nof customers unless I want them to buy\nmore things or I have new customers\ncoming\nin so what is common between my observed\nset of data and the data for my new\ncustomers that commonality is what you\ncan think of as a\ndistribution so he says that from from\nthis can you give me a sense of what\nthis distribution is and from this\ndistribution I can think of other\npeople\ncoming so what we'll do tomorrow is\nwe'll talk about a few distributions\ncertain few specific distributions and\nhow to do calculations in the\ndistributions for now what this graphic\ndoes is it simply calculates that\ndistribution for\nyou I'll explain very very briefly how\nit does that won't go into too many\ndetails what it does is it takes the\naverages of\npoints yes so you mean that for a sample\ndistribution cannot be\ndone I'm saying that for a\nsample why so why is not the sample the\ndistribution\nitself why am I not saying it's a good\nquestion why am I not saying ignore the\ncurve why am I not saying that the\noriginal histogram which I've seen three\nor four times before why is that itself\nnot the\ndistribution that's similar to the\nfollowing question let's suppose that\nyou have done a blood pressure test and\nyou've gotten a few\nmeasurements you've been tested twice\ntoday let's say prear you know before\nbreakast after breakfast next week also\nyou have done this let's say you have\ndone this for whatever be your reason\nyouve done this say once a week for a\nmonth so now you got four\nreadings no not four read eight readings\nnow these eight\nreadings is that the\ndistribution no you\nhave yes so there's something something\nthat says yes if I want to understand\nwhat my blood sugar is and what it will\nbe going forward if I do not get treated\nthen certainly there's a relationship\nbetween this and what will happen in the\nfuture for example if I behave exactly\nthe same way if I eat exactly the same\nway or I exercise or not exact exercise\nexact exactly the same way if I smoke if\nmy lifestyle is exactly the same as it\nis I would expect my readings to be the\nsame but what about it is going to be\nthe same and what about it is different\nI don't quite know yes it is true that\nthose eight\nnumbers are a representation of the\ndistribution but they're not the\ndistribution itself if they were the\ndistribution itself I would be forced to\nsay that in the next month I would have\nexactly these eight\nreadings but I know that's not true\nbut I also know that from these eight\nreadings I can say something about what\nwill happen next\nmonth it's not that there's useless\ninformation\nthere so if my readings this month for\nexample are let's say 110 120 115 125\nlet's say good health 130 Etc I know\nthese these are my readings I know with\nsome idea perhaps that that if things\nbecome remain the same next month they\nwill not start becoming 22 20 210 215\n230 they will not become\nthat how do I know that because I have\nthis readings this\nmonth so the idea of a distribution is\nto be able to abstract away from the\ndata the the random part and the\nsystematic part and the systematic part\nis what remains as the distribution\naround it there's going to be a random\nvariation and that random variation is\ngoing to exist from data set to data set\nlike this month and next month like this\nbunch of customers and and another set\nof customers who buy cardio equipment\nmaybe from another branch of my\nstore if I am for example uh running\nlet's say a chain of stores let's say\nthat I'm oh I don't know not to pick\nnames but let's say I don't know\nReliance fresh or something of that sort\nand I want to understand how my stores\nare doing let's say I take five or six\nstores and I study them extensively how\ndo I know that those results are going\nto apply to the remainder of my 500 600\nstores what is common between these five\nand the remainder how are they\nrepresentative of it what part of it\napplies to the rest and what part of it\ndoes not how do I extend it how do I\nextend your blood pressure readings to\nthe next blood pressure\nreadings how do I figure this out that\nis the heart of Statistics that's called\nstatistical\ninference to abstract away from the data\ncertain things that remain the same and\ncertain things that do not so a\ndistribution is an estimate of that\nunderlying true distribution of\nage and so it's not as rough it's\nsmoother how smooth is something that\nthe plot changes that the plot figures\nout on its own like histogram but you\nare free to change\nit you are free to change it there are\nfun there are functions within it\nfunctions within this plot and that's\nit's a it's a fairly sophisticated\nfunction which you can do which you can\ndo many things with I mean it's a fairly\nsophisticated thing there are many many\nfunctions available within it so for\nexample this bin of histogram this\nallows you to say where should the\nboundaries of those his the histogram\npart of it\nbe whether you want to plot it or not\nwhether you want to plot that that what\nI was calling a distribution the\ngaussian kernel density estimate it's a\nsophisticated way of saying the same\nthing and there are functions available\nto put into that so you can change this\nit's it's one of the one of the most\nsophisticated plotting functionals that\nyou'll be able to\nsee I wouldn't suggest doing it now get\na little more experience in doing this\nbut gaussian will not make too much of a\ndifference what will happen is if if\nthere is if there is no smoothing out\nhere it'll look like a it'll look like a\nnormal distribution this little these\nlittle Wiggles will go away me um it's\nbetter gives you a Smo curve we will\ndiscuss that a little later as to when\nmaybe tomorrow as to when it's a good\nidea to do that and when it is not H\njust hold on to that question in a\nlittle bit we haven't talked about the\ngaussian distribution yet I'll deal with\nthat when the gaing distribution comes\nfor now what this is is it gives you a\nvisual representation simply a\ndescriptive\nrepresentation of the underlying\ndistribution hence a distri hence a\ndistribution plot distribution you\nalways want to compare with the like the\nsamples eight samples if take an example\nyou distributed them then you're taking\na current\nsample the current yes so if my\ndistribution is\ncorrect let's suppose in an Ideal World\nif my distribution thinking is correct\nthen here's what would happen if I take\nmy old new old Aid data and I do a\nhistogram sorry I do a dist in the new\ndata I do a disc again these two should\nbe very\nsimilar the histograms may be different\nyeah but the distributions should be\nsimilar if I've done my analysis\ncorrectly does that mean the variance is\nI wouldn't use the word variance I'd say\nvariability it means that there is a\nthere is a s this is called sampling\nvariability in other words there's a VAR\nvariability that is due to the fact that\nyou've taken a\nsample there is an underlying truth but\nyou're not seeing that truth because\nyou're taking a sample there is an\nunderlying level of your blood sugar but\nyou're not seeing that because you've\ntaken only a very small sample of your\nblood a few milliliters where there are\nliters flowing around and at only for at\na few second in time there are many\nhours in the\nday there are so many other things that\nyour reading could have been but if it\nis a good if it is a good sample then\nwhat would happen is that I'll be able\nto cover this\nvariability so if I want to get a sense\nof what your blood sample actually is\nand I want to sample this well what I\nwill do is I'll take samples in\ndifferent kinds of situations one thing\nthey cover for example before eating and\nafter eating that that they cover I\nmaybe maybe I want to cover other things\nas well for example in certain kinds of\ndiseases they're very conscious as to\nwhere to take the blood\nfrom because the the metabolism in the\nblood changes based on what certain\ndiseases and I won't make for example\nyou draw the blood near the liver the\nliver is the body's filtration\nsystem so essentially you want to figure\nout the nature of the blood when it\nflows into the into the liver and and\nthen after it flows out of the liver in\norder to understand whether the liver is\nfiltering your blood correctly or\nnot now to do that you need to draw the\nblood in very specific\nplaces so in order to do that therefore\nyou your experimentation should cover\nall of that what does that mean for\nexample in business terms let's say that\nyou're looking at sales data and you\nwant to understand your sales\ndistribution well don't focus on certain\nsales people look at your bad sales\npeople look at your good sales people\nlook at your high selling products look\nat your no selling products cover the\nrange of\npossibilities if you do not cover the\nrange of possibilities you will not see\nthe distribution and if you do not see\nthe distribution you will not know what\nwhere the future data will come from and\nif you don't know that you'll not be\nable to do any prediction or\nprescription for\nthat histogram is just a summary this is\nalso just a summary but the histogram\nsummary applies to just this data set\nthis distribution is pretending to apply\nto a little bit more what is the\ndefinition of it definition of\ndistribution the definition of a\ndistribution doesn't apply to the data\nso a distribution function so to speak\nis just this so for example it's\nsometimes defined this way f of x is\nequal to the probability that X is less\nthan or equal to X this is sometimes\ncalled a distribution function f of x is\nequal to the chance that age is less\nthan or equal to say 15 age is less than\nto 16 a to 17 and now let me confuse you\neven more h\nF ofx this is the derivative of x the\ndifferential of X is the density\nfunction which is the area under the\ncurve this is called the density\nfunction which is what this plot is\nplotting this is sometimes called the\ndensity function the density function so\nthe distribution function is the\nintegral of the density function and the\ndensity function is the derivative of\nthe distribution function if you're very\nmaty in all of\nthis huh so so what they're plotting is\nplotting the density function I showed\nthe so this is actually called the\ndensity function the reason I'm calling\nit a distribution function is because it\nsays distribution here I was hoping not\nto confuse you clearly I failed go\nahead\nyes that's the\nidea\nyes ah now you now you now you've hit\nthe problem of Statistics bang on the\nhead how do I get an idea of a\ndistribution that applies to everyone\nbased on only one sample sitting in\nfront of\nmezen that is the million dollar\nquestion and that is why people like me\nexist right that is the whole point of\nthe\nsubject and it is a hard\nproblem it is a hard problem because you\nare trying to draw a\nconclusion outside your\ndata\nyou are you're not nobody is interested\nin your data nobody's interested in your\ndata right everybody's interested in\ntheir data or in their\nproblem nobody's interested in your data\nnow but you still have to analyze the\ndata that is in front of you and reach a\nconclusion that makes sense to them the\nbank has to look at its at its you know\nportfolio and figure out what his risk\nstrategy should be the clothing store\nneeds to figure out look at its sales\nand figure out what loads it should\nmake great learning has to figure out\nits course reviews and figure out which\nfaculty members to keep you have to look\nat your uh your expenditures and figure\nout how much salary to negotiate\nfor huh how will you do all of\nthis how do you do all of this by the\nway based on some sense of distribution\nright so so when you go and you\nnegotiate for a salary now you're not\ngoing to negotiate for you know 100 cres\nyou might but you say no one's going to\ngive me that anyway\nso maybe you're good enough I don't know\nbut but but what you do is you\nessentially say you do roughly something\nlike the following you figure out how\nmuch money you need and how much money\nyou are\nexpecting and that to Drums to some\nextent is based on your expenditure and\nwhat you want to do your expenditure is\nalso based on that you have a certain\nincome and you're spending based on this\nyou're doing all of this on a on a on a\nregular basis H you're standing on the\nroad correct you're standing on the road\nand you're trying to decide whether to\ncross it how do you\ndecide experience you got past data and\nthat data is telling you please cross\nthe road how that data has not seen that\ncar H k53 3619 with his driver has not\nbeen seen by your data set how are you\nCrossing because you're making the\nassumption that while I have not seen\nhim I've seen many others like\nhim so so there there's this story right\nso you\nknow um a taxi driver is is is is going\nat night on the road etc etc and he's\njust running left right left right so\nred\nlight cross no issues ETC it just keeps\ngoing the the driver the passenger is\ngetting very\nscared\nstop the the driver he says in Hindi\napologize for the\nlanguage and I'm the lion of the road\nwho will stop me he goes through all the\nred lights and then there's a green\nlight and then he\nstops and then he says why will you stop\nnow the guy\nsays so the guy on the other side so\nhe's logical right so his data is saying\nthat there are people who cross the red\nlight so therefore if I'm standing in\nlight there's red light on the other\nside cars are going to cross that red\nlight\nright very\nlogical so therefore and we do this all\nthe time so while we are not trained as\nstatisticians at least normal people are\nnot they behave like one based on the\nexperience now your objective and the\nobjective of an analytics professional\nis to translate this logic into a\nalgorithm into a procedure the that the\ncompany and the computer\nunderstands and that is not easy for\nstarters let's say that you that you\nthat you are here and you say that this\nis an average right this is the mean age\nthis is\n28.78\nA8 and you could say that this is an\nestimate of the mean of the\ndistribution this is not this is the\nmean of the data but you are not\ninterested in the mean of the data why\nyou not interested in the mean of the\ndata because you're not interested in\nthis particular set of 180\npeople but you are interested in the\naverage age of my customers so now the\nquestion becomes what does the age of my\nnew customers have to do with the number\n28 are they related yes you would say\nthat they're they're like a copy of what\nI\nhave now that's interesting so they if\nthey like a copy of what I have then\nwill I see 28.78 again and now you'll\nsay probably not there a copy but not\nthat much of a copy most likely ah now\nwe\ntalking so now How likely is most likely\nand what about it is going to be the\nsame and what about it is going to be\ndifferent y AIS of the distribution so\nthe y- axis of the distribution you'll\nsay is the same Al so for example you\ncould say that this 78.8 is an estimate\nof the population distribution which\nmeans that yes it comes from the history\nprog it comes from the same data history\ncomes from but it also comes from this\ndistribution but there's also this\nnagging feeling that I do not know for\nsure I do not know I don't know what\nthis new data is going to be so what\nwill happen is we will not give the\nanswer 78 28 sorry we will not give the\nanswer\n28.7 we'll give an answer that is like\n28.7 plus minus something we'll say I do\nnot know what the population mean is but\nI'm going to guess it's around 20\n8 I know it is not going to be exactly\n28 but 28 isn't useless for me\neither it's going to be around by by\naround\n28 how much around\n28 now certain criteria come in what\nwill this depend on it will depend on\nthe variation of the data if the data is\nstandard deviation if the data is very\nvariable this plus minus will be large\nand the nature of the data right same\nyes the nature it will depend upon\nhow many things I'm averaging over if\nthis was\n180 I'm so sure if this was\n18,000 I'll be even more\nsure if this was 18 I'd be less\nsure so it depends on how much data is\nbeing averaged over the more data I have\nthe Sher I am about the repeatability of\nit the Sher I am that I will see\nsomething similar\nagain it depends upon how sure I I want\nto be if I want to be 95%\nsure if I want to be 99% sure if I want\nto be 99 the more sure I want to be the\nbigger the the the the tolerance I must\nhave on my on my interval and those are\nthings we'll get to so those are also\ndesriptions but those desriptions are\nheading towards being able to predict so\nnow if I give you this 28.78 I've given\nyou a description of the data but I'm\nnot given you a\nprediction if if I've now given you\n28.78 plus minus something I've now\nbegun to give you a\nprediction H today is about descriptive\nanalytics we're not we're not predicting\nanything we'll get there but this plot\nis in some way a first measure of of of\nof looking at this idea of a population\nand of a distribution associated with\nthe\npopulation this is\nyeah huh\nif the if the variation less this Curve\nwill be\nSharp flat means variation is\nmore if the curve goes this way it means\nthat there is a lot of variation I'm\nunsure about the middle in that case you\ncan't get the proper prediction it's\nharder you need more\ndata data is more\ndefinitely not\nthe variation of the average would go\nless so let's suppose that you have no\ncontrol over your diet I'm not accusing\nyou of\nanything it happens to humans but let's\nsuppose that you are doing a job in\nwhich your lifestyle is very varied you\ntravel from place to place you eat in\ndifferent hotels sometimes you don't eat\nat all sometimes you stress out a lot\nsometimes you're naturally going after\ntrains and sometimes you're sleeping for\n12 hours in a row your life is highly\nvariable now let's suppose and there's\nnothing wrong with that many people have\nvery varied lives but let's suppose I'm\nnow trying to measure the blood sugar of\nsuch a\nperson what must I\ndo\nnow try to other variables or at the\nvery least what I need to do is if I\nsimply want to get a good blood pressure\nmeasurement is I have to measure it\nunder many different\ncircumstances or I could argue I don't\ncontrol your circumstances\nI can control your circumstances so I\ncan say for example that go and measure\nit at this time or go and measure it\ntake a\nglucometer take a glucometer and before\ngoing to bed do this H or after you've\njust had a very hard day do this I can\ngive certain instructions to cover all\nthe corners or I can simply say I don't\nknow but what you need to do is you need\nto measure your blood pressure or sorry\nyour blood sugar say every 6 hours and\nthen tell me what happens but you need\nto to do this often because I expect\nyour blood sugar to be highly\nvariable simply because your body is\nbeing put through a enormous amount of\nvariation in a business situation let's\nsuppose that you've introduced a new\nproduct you do not know if this new\nproduct is going to sell or not what\nwill you what will you do I mean how\nwill you measure it you've just\nintroduced\nit based on past data you'll do that but\nyou've just released it you can measure\ncurrent dat\nno different situation I've just\nreleased the product all that is over\nall that is over I now have just\nreleased this this watch in the\nmarket what typically happens is people\ntrack the market very very closely\nnumber number of History the ads number\nof sales made everything the reason is\nbecause they're not sure how much this\nwill sell see the question is what\nchanged what changed was your product\nrelease now the competitor could be\nreacting immed immediately my point is\nnot my point is not that there are many\nthings to look at which you should my\npoint is that when there is a change in\nthe distribution when there is when\nthere is an un unknown distribution\ncoming in front of you whose variation\nyou do not know you tend to get more\ndata you sample more frequently or you\nget more data you you you you figure\nthis out H we do this all the time for\nexample let's suppose for those of you\nwho who have kids let's suppose your kid\nis is going to a new school what will\nyou\ndo you'll ask more questions to them\nyou'll get more data you'll find out\nwhat is happening in school what are the\nteachers like it because there's too\nmuch variability standing in front of\nyou now with those answers and then you\ndo a few trips to the school you're now\na little more you know you may like it\nyou may not like it but you're at least\nmore more informed that distribution is\nnow known to\nyou so you get more and more\ndata\nthat's why you get the experience that's\nwhy you start getting that\nexperience if you have that experience\nalready in other words if you know the\ndistribution very very well and you're\ncomfortable with\nit it'll take time to get there and\nthat's why this big data world is\nbecoming so interesting that by the time\nyou've understood a problem the problem\nis not important\nanymore there's a new problem now this\nis good right that's why you guys have\njobs huh but also means that the answer\nto that is it also means that when you\nhave new data you solve a different\nproblem you don't solve the older\nproblem\nbetter which is what a statistician to\nsome extent is trained to do that as you\nget more and more data get the\ndistribution better get a better idea of\nthe\nunknown make a better product but the\nalternative view is make another\nproduct solve a different\nproblem if you have more data so the CEO\nis now saying I have more\ndata give me\nmore more of what solve another problem\nfor me give me new customers that I can\ngo after and things like that so\ntherefore that problem is is a problem\nthat statistic Big Data people often and\nand it's not an easy problem to go\nafter that as you have more and more\ndata coming in how do you utilize it how\nhow do you how do you how do you make\nefficient use of this information do you\nget tighter estimates of what you're\ngoing after you're doing sentiment\nanalysis of text many people do text\nanalysis you'll write you know Twitter\ncode in Excel and you'll do Laten\nsemantic analysis you'll look at\npositive net you know net sentiment\nscores and things of that and now the\nquestion will be that you know that this\nis going to change people's opinions are\ngoing to\nchange correct\nso over what granularity do you expect\npeople's opinions to say the same do\nthey change every day if they change\nevery day there is no point looking at a\nperson over an average of days because\nthat average is\nnothing every day is a different opinion\non the other hand if their opinions\nchange let's say on a monthly basis then\nyou can look at Daily averages and\naverage them you'll get a better\nestimate of that monthly\nrating so so so you have to make a guess\nas to whether I'm estimating a changing\nthing or whether I'm estimating a solid\nthing\nbetter and that's not a that's not an\neasy thing to\ndo it's is a I know it's happened to me\nI don't know whether it's happened to\nyou or not but there are times in my\nlife where I have simply not had\nhaircuts what that means is I've gone 6\nMonths 8 months a haircut has been like\na weight loss program\nright I'm not cared what I look like I'm\nnot sure I do now but you know when\nthings become very unhygienic I go and\nget a\nhaircut there have also been times in my\nlife when I've been a lot more conscious\nof what others think about me you can\nimagine what points in my life so now I\ngroom I'm very careful I get my hair\ndone and you know I'm all correct and\nI'm getting my hair cut much more\nregularly now what am I doing so in the\nsecond case what I'm doing is I'm trying\nto make sure that I'm reaching a certain\ndistributional\nstandard in other words there certain\nTarget distribution that I have and I'm\ninterested in getting there I'm\nintolerent of variability I'm saying\nthat I'm going to estimate this\ndistribution I'm going to stay close to\nit in the first case I was not I was\nperfectly okay with the\nvariability and in certain cases you\nwill be okay with the variability and\nyou will not want to estimate a\ndistribution of this type and in certain\ncases you will you will want to\nestimated very very\nwell you'll want your hair to be done\nvery correctly you'll want your product\nto be targeted to a very specific age\ngroup you'll want to know that when I am\ntargeting to this particular age group\nwhat advertisements do I want to show\nyou'll want to advertise it on\ntelevision and you'll want to know who\nis watching the program on which you\nadvertising\nthis are they are they College people\nare they professionals are the old\npeople sitting at home who will use this\nand therefore where will I advertise my\ncardio product there times when you want\nto know this very very precisely or as\nprecisely as you\ncan so\ntherefore this number this mean number\nand this number from a description\nperspective from a description\nperspective is perfectly okay it is just\nthe\naverage but from an inferential\nperspective it's just the beginning of\nthe journey it's just one number and\nwe're going to have to put a little more\nbells and whistles around this go ahead\nyou have lots of questions clearly uh\nusually what we read is\nthat a variable with not normal\ndistribution should not be taken further\nin the stud okay so we haven't talked\nabout normal distributions we will do\ntomorrow but\nso statisticians need to make\nassumptions about their data one of the\nassumptions is what he's talking about\nit assumes a certain distribution it\nsays that I'm going to assume that the\ndata has a normal distribution is an\nassumption now why do statisticians make\nassumptions like that one reason they\nmake assumptions like that is because\nthey make the calculation becomes easier\nnow just because the calculation becomes\neasier doesn't mean the calculation is\ncorrect because if the assumption is\nwrong the calculation is also going to\nbe\nwrong but because of the Assumption you\ncan do many of these calculations and if\nyou don't make those assumptions these\ncalculations now become difficult or\neven impossible given the data at hand\nso a lot of the tests and a lot of the\nprocedures that we'll be talking about\nare going to make certain assumptions\nwe'll see one in about an hour or\nso and if that assumption is correct I\nwill have a strong model but if that\nassumption is wrong I will still have a\nmodel that\nis that that is indicative so there was\nan econom I think Paul Samuel said I'm\nnot entirely sure who but someone who\nsaid No George box I think the box and\nthe box box he said that um all models\nare wrong but some models are\nuseful right so the question is it may\nstill be\nuseful if in many cases the distribution\nis expressly allowed to be not normal\nthe domain tells you that let's say that\nyou are in an engineering domain you\nknow the data has a certain shape and\nthe engineering domain tells you that\nit's a shape and the shape is sometimes\ncalled a wable distribution what that\nmeans is that if you reporting out let's\nsay the failures of something you're\nreporting out the failures of gas\nturbine blades as I spent a number of\nyears doing that we had to report out a\nviable distribution we didn't report out\na normal distribution we had to report\nout a viable\ndistribution in the finance industry you\nreport out a log normal distribution\nmeans and variances of it every industry\nhas its own favorite distribution\nbecause every industry has its own\ngeneric data\nform now even within the industry a\nparticular data set could violate that\nrule and then it becomes interesting\nthat as a statistician do you now use a\nhigher power tool set a more powerful\ntool set to solve\nthat this leads to certain complexities\nthe first complexity that often runs\ninto is which one and do I different do\nI do it differently from someone\nelse is like a doctor who looks at a\npatient and says that uh you know what\nthe textbook says that I should do it\nthis way but I like this guy he looks\ndifferent H I've never seen anyone like\nhim before more so let me ignore the\ntextbook and treat him this way I think\nhe'll get\nbetter now could he could I be right I\ncould but I'm taking a\nrisk so every time you're making an\nassumption on your own and following\nthrough on it you're taking a very\nsimilar risk you could be right for that\nparticular case but the Precedence you\nhave far fewer precedences to go on and\nas a result of which later on when you\nextend it Beyond to someone else you're\ngoing to have to you're going to find it\nhard to do\nso so therefore people often make\nassumptions and distributions in a sort\nof in a sort of historical sense that\nthey've known that this has worked\nmoderately well over a period of time\nand they're very hesitant to change it\nfor particular\ncases sometimes they're not allowed to\nin regulatory terms they're not allowed\nto uh any accountants\nhere accountants right so accountants so\nyou know this so if you're an accountant\nyou have to do your books in a certain\nway right let's say that you're\nmeasuring cash flow there there is there\nis a certain way in which you will\nmeasure cash\nflow right now you may say that in this\nparticular month your business was done\na little differently so I'm going to\nshow better cash flow this way if you\ncan you know you're running into\ntrouble now you may be right you may be\nright in the sense that that may\nactually a better way better way of\ndoing it but but as soon as you go out\nof CFA CFA as soon as you go out of a\nvery standard way of doing\nthings things will be a\nproblem and the same kind of logic\napplies to often statistical analysis as\nwell so as a result of which like an\naccountant you are you are doing the\nright thing approximately most of the\ntime in in in in machine learning\nthere's a term that you might see\nthere's a term that's often called like\nsupervised unsupervised Etc is called\npack\nlearning pack\nlearning it's a it's a deeply technical\nfield and pack stands for probably\napproximately\ncorrect probably approximately\ncorrect I'm not telling you anything if\nI'm wrong don't blame\nme but I'm probably approximately\ncorrect and the probabilistic part comes\nfrom statistical thinking the\napproximately part comes from machine\nlearning thinking and and and it's a\nit's a it's a deep field it's a serious\nfield but it it it puts a probabilistic\nstatement or an approximation so\ntherefore at the end of the day whatever\nmethod you use there has to be a sense\nof how generalizable it\nis you will do that um you'll do that\nfairly soon in in a couple of months\nyou'll do a first\nhackathon and your first hackathon all\nyour hackathons will have a certain feel\nto them a common feel for hackathon is\nI'm going to give you a data set you\nbuild your model on the data set and I\nam going to have a data set that I'm not\ngoing to show you and I'm going to tell\nyou how well your model has done on my\ndata\nset and you have a day or 6 hours or\nwhatever to fill around with your data\nset and show Improvement on my data\nset this is what you'll do you'll do it\ntwice I think in your in your schedule\nwhat does that mean it means that by\nbeing very good on your data set doesn't\nnecessarily mean you are\nsuccessful you have to be good on my\ndata set but I'm not going to give you\nmy data\nset this is not as impossible as it\nsounds this is a very standard problem\nand this is a typical problem you will\nnot find this hard you'll find this very\neasy by the time you get there no no no\nnot a problem you all will your\npredecessors will you will you'll get\nyou know 96 99 what whatever percent\naccuracy not to worry technically this\nis not hard how oh so right so there are\ntwo answers to that one is if the mean\nis different from the median then you\nask no\nno mean being equal to the median from a\ndistribution sense means that these are\nthe two\nnumbers okay if the distribution looks\nlike this and I have a I have a\nparameter mu we we're going to do this\nlater when when statisticians use a\nGreek letter they're referring to\nsomething that they do not\nknow right It's All Greek to\nthem so mu is a population parameter it\nexists but it is\nunknown it exists but it is unknown now\nif the distribution is nice and\nsymmetric like this then this unknown\nthing in the middle can be estimated\nusing a mean or it can be estimated\nusing a median now the question becomes\nwhich is better and the answer to that\nroughly speaking is this that if there\nare many outliers if this distribution\ntends to sort of spread out to the tals\nthen use a\nmedian because of the reason that I said\nthe median becomes stable to\noutliers if this distribution has a more\nBel shape curve of this particular kind\nthe mean is more efficient at this a\nbetter answer is what if the nature of\nthe distribution is not that but it is\nlike this then the the median may be\nhere and the mean may be here now you're\nasking different question now it's not a\nStatistics question it's a common sense\nor a science likee question which one\nare you interested in are you interested\nin per capita income or are you\ninterested in the income of the typical\nIndian correct for example let me ask\nyou this how much time or give me one\nnumber one representation of the amount\nof time that you spend on a\nwebsite I'm asking for one number don't\ntell me the number but think in your\nhead as to how you would answer\nthis how much time do you spend on a\nwebsite by a website what I mean is this\naage yes but what does average\nmean so how would I do this so so here\nhere's what I'm asking you you're\ncruising the web every day let's say so\nwhat I'm asking for is a number like\nthis that and the amount of time that\nyou spend on a website you go to\ndifferent websites and you spend a\nvariable amount of time on each of these\nwebsites for whatever be your purpose\nsometimes you're just passing through\nsometimes you're seeing a video\nsometimes you're sending an email blah\nblah blah whatever and every session I'm\nthinking of as a different website and\nyou go to if you go to Google twice then\nI thinking I'm thinking of that as two\nwebsites so session wise so to speak now\nI'm asking for representative\nnumber so how would you come up with\nthat number what's what's what's a fair\nanswer to\nthat a mean so if I do the mean here is\nhow I would do it on a given day I would\nso the first website I've gone to I'll\nfind out how much time I spend there\nsecond how much time I spend there third\nhow much time I spend there fourth how\nmuch time I spend there and I add this\nup and I divide that's the mean right\nwhat would be the\nmedian the median would be i' look at\nall those times and I sort it and i' put\nthis in which is going to be\nlarger\nit depends is correct but in this\nparticular case so think of your think\nof your typical browsing habits now\neveryone's browsing habit is different\nhuh but just think of it and Network\npeople who deal with network traffic\ndeal with this problem on a on a regular\nbasis so here is what usually\nhappens most of your sessions are\nactually quite\nshort for example a query you go to a\nwebsite and you post a you post a query\nor you go to your Gmail and you check\nwhether there's been a new email or you\ngo to a favorite website news site and\nsee whether something new is there or\nnot most of the actual Pages you visit\nyou don't spend a lot of time on\nbut sometimes you go to a website and\nyou spend a lot of time on it let's say\nyou write an email let's say you see a\nvideo so what does your data look like\nmany small\nnumbers and a few big\nnumbers this is what is called a heavy\ntail distribution the distribution the\nhistogram sometimes looks like\nthis heavy\ntailed this is the right tail this is\ncalled a tail of a\ndistribution a tail to a statistician is\nnot an animal\nthing a tail is usually refers to the\nend of a distribution\nsomething called a heavy tail\ndistribution and and network traffic is\na is an example of a typical example of\nheavy tail so now here is what happens\npeople in this particular case the mean\nand the median are carrying very\ndifferent kinds of\ninformation the median is essentially\nsaying that for a typical website that\nyou go to how much time do you spend on\na typical\nwebsite now the if that number is low\nthat is an indication that most of the\ntime you are shall we say\ncruising or\nbrowsing on the other hand if you if\nyou're looking at the mean and that\nnumber is high then you know that you're\nspending a lot of time on certain very\nspecific\nwebsites and this points to two very\ndifferent kinds of\npeople so the mean and the median are\ncarrying different kinds of of\ninformation with them both\nuseful so in answer to your question it\ndepends on what you're going\nafter and and and in certain things you\nwill see one of them being naturally\nused as opposed to the other there's\nalso a third one called the mode which\nis which is actually harder when we when\nwe were sta students we study M median\nmode and the mode is the peak of the\ndistribution what is most likely\nand the reason the mode isn't talked\nabout much is because the mode actually\nalgorithmically is very hard to get at\nthe mean is a very simple algorithm the\nmedian is a very simple algorithm the\nmode is a harder\nalgorithm you can think about how to\nwrite a program for the mode if you want\nto it's it's a much harder algorithm so\nthe mode essentially what is the mode of\nthis distribution for\nexample so let's take a look at one of\nthem this is what\num this is income for\nmen what is the modal income the modal\nincome is\nhere it's some somewhere around 55,000\nwhere this maximum\nis correct for women it's here maybe\njust less than\n50,000 so you understand what the mode\nis it is the it is the highest frequency\nor the most common value\nbut in practice that's actually a little\ndifficult to do if I give you a set of\nnumbers how will you calculate the\nmode but will you see a spike what is a\nspike so I'll give you all your\nages how would you calculate the mode so\none possibility is you you'll look at\nthe age and ask which age is the\ncommonest where the count count of the\nAG where the count of the age is more\nbut that almost almost means that your\ndata is not\nnumerical you're almost thinking of the\ndata as being categorical because you're\ncounting how many observations there are\nat a\nvalue the idea of a numeric is that it's\nsort of continuous it's not chunked that\nway so for data that is chunked up or\ncategorical you can easily calculate the\nmode but something that is not and so\nthe mode therefore has become less\nfashionable because it's not a very easy\nthing to go after when we were in\ncollege the more was something actually\nquite easy to calculate here's the way\nwe would calculate the mode here is the\nhistogram and the way we would calculate\nthe mode is this we draw a line from\nhere to here we draw a line from here to\nhere left to left take the highest\nclass draw this cross line draw this\ncross line and here is the\nmode this is the way we would do the\nmode in the pre-computer\nera right I went to college where we\ndidn't have any lap laptops and things\nlike that running a program meant\nrunning to the computer center with\npieces of\npaper so many of these things were done\nby hand and this is something very easy\nto do by manually this is not that easy\nto do on a\ncomputer the logic\nis Twisted you have to figure out what\nthe binwidth\nis therefore you have to make therefore\nhis estimation of mode and his\nestimation of mode will be different\nfrom the same data set that is not going\nto be true for the mean or for the\nmedian and as soon as two different\npeople find the same answer to the same\ndifferent answers to the same question\nyou know there's a problem with the\nstatistic so therefore this\nis so so the mode isn't done as much\nthese days these are the histograms sort\nof my data histogram it's this is a way\nof separating out the histograms in\nother words looking at the histograms by\ndifferent column equal to income\nessentially means at which variable the\nbuy says which gender so it's and they\ngo Side by size because they essentially\ntell you as to what the difference in\nthe distributions is so what does this\ntell you I could have plotted a uh a dis\nplot here as well or other code could\nhave but this has says that there is a\nlittle bit of a difference between the\nmale and the female distributions in\nshape as well as in the actual value so\nto speak and so from a descriptive\nperspective you can keep doing analysis\nof this kind to see whether there is a\ndifference not just in the in gender\nvariable but in other variables as\nwell do people travel the same amount of\nmiles on different um on different\ndevices a plot like this will tell you\num to compare these\ntwo what we can do in the next residency\nor you can do as an assignment after\nthat is you can say is there a\nstatistical difference between the miles\nof\nproducts that are traveled or that are\nused\nfor between the different products in\nother words is there a difference\nbetween these three products in terms of\nhow much usage they see and you can\ncompare three distributions and we will\ncompare three distributions in\ntime okay now the last idea I want to\ntalk about\ntoday is we've done we we've talked\nmostly about univariate which is one\nvariable we saw a little bit of a plot\nbut I want to talk about shall we say by\nvariate by variate means two variables\nat a time if you want to talk about many\nvariables at a time that's called\nmultivariant but before we get to many\nlet's get to\ntwo so we've we've looked at one notion\nor we've looked at two Notions we've\nlooked at the notion of\nlocation location means that if there is\na distribution what is its middle and\nthat can be mean or median we have\nlooked at\nvariation like standard deviation range\nand\nan interquartile range but when I look\nat distributions of two variables\nthere's a little bit more to\nit there is a relationship between the\ntwo variables that I want to want to be\nable to capture a sense of relation or a\nsense of correlation that how do I\nmeasure whether one variable is related\nto the other variable or not remember\nI'm still\ndescribing I'm still trying to find a\nnumber like a mean like a standard\ndeviation I'm trying to simply describe\na number if that number is this\ncorrelation is high if that number is\nthis correlation is low what should that\nnumber be there are many many ways of\ndefining such a\nnumber here is one and is there in the\nbook Let's\nsuppose so I'm going to do this slightly\nabstractly so I've got I've got numbers\nthat look like this\nX1\nthese are my points so for\nexample if I look at say a\nplot here let's take one of these\num this is say miles and\nincome the amount of exercise done and\nincome each of these points has an x\ncoordinate and a y coordinate\nthese coordinates I'm calling X1 y1 X2\nY2 X3 Y3 X4 y4 x180 y18 you\nunderstand there pairs of\nobservations this is say X1 y1 this is\nsay X2\nY2 this is say X3 Y3 the pairs of\nobservations this way\nright now\nxar is\nwhat 1 /\nn\nX1 + xn and I'm going to write this\nsimply because I'm going to have to\nwrite something a little more\ncomplicated now summation I is equal to\n1 2 n x\ni if you don't like the sigma notation\nthat's fine you can write it with\ndots I add a little complexity\nhere Y Bar which is the average is\nsimilarly summation I is = to 1 2 n y\ni\nokay now I'm going to write something\nhere I'm going to write\nsummation x i -\nxar y i - y\nbar I'm going to write that down I'll\ntell you why I'm writing that down\nbut look at\nthat what is X i-\nxar it's it's sort of like a variation\nor a spread of XI from its\naverage similarly Yi minus y bar okay\nnow when is this\nterm x i - xar y i - Y Bar when is it\npositive when both of these are\npositive or both of them are negative\nright now both of them are positive\nmeans what both of them are positive\nmeans XI is above\naverage and Yi is above\naverage\nright both negative\nmeans XI is below average or Yi is below\naverage\nso imagine a data set that looks like\nthis where is xar and Y bar somewhere in\nthe middle\nhere here is one line Sorry here is a\nline and here is another\nline for all the points\nhere XI is above its average and Yi is\nabove its average\nfor all the points here XI is below its\naverage and Y is below its average which\nmeans all these terms or most of these\nterms are going to be positive I may\nstill have a point for example say this\npoint where it is\nnegative but when my data looks like\nthis this number will\nbe\npositive what happens when my data looks\nlike this\nwhen my data looks like this then XI is\nabove its average sorry Yi is above its\naverage and XI is below its average that\nmeans one of these is positive and one\nof these is negative that means this guy\nis\nnegative so when the data looks like\nthis this becomes negative\nwhat happens if the data looks\nlike\nthis the positives and the negatives\nwill this number being negative means\nwhen one is high the other is\nlow for example let's say height and\nweight height and weight means what the\ntaller you\nare the heavier you are the relationship\nbetween the\ntwo my doctor says that I'm about four\nor 5 kilos over\noverweight I say no doctor I'm about 2\nin too\nshort I don't have a weight problem I\nhave a height problem your\ninterpretation\nso so\ntherefore so if you want to therefore\nget a statistic that captures whether\nyour data whether your variables are\nmoving together or in opposite\ndirections opposite directions for\nexample might be something like say\nweight of a car and mileage of a\ncar bigger cars have lesser\nmileage which means that if you have an\nabove average weight\ncar that's probably has a lower average\nlower than average\nmileage so this particular\nmeasure this is an\naddition when I divide it by 1 / n\nminus1 to take an average effect this\nthing is called the co-variance of X and\nY this is called the co-variance of X\nand Y covariance are very heavily used\nin certain\nareas um they're heavily used for\nexample in um you know Dimension\nreduction in principal components you'll\nsee that in time um they're used in\nfinance for portfolio management and\nthings of that sort this is called a\ncovariance of X and Y what is the\ncovariance of X and\nX the co variant of X and\nX which means instead of Y I'll just put\nX this becomes 1 / n minus 1 summation I\n= 1 to n x i - xar into x i -\nXR which means x i - X bar\nsquared which is the square of the\nstandard deviation this is sometimes\ncalled the variance of\nX which is the same as the standard\ndeviation of x\nsquared so that thing that before I took\nthe square root that's called the\nvariance with the square root is called\nthe standard deviation without the\nsquare root is called the variance by\nthe way it's all there in the\nbook H so in case you didn't get it you\ncan see the video or you can read the\nbook or these are very standard\ndefinitions so the covariance is a\nmeasure\nof the nature of the relationship\nbetween X and Y if the covariance is\npositive they're moving in the same\ndirection if the covariance is negative\nthey're moving in opposite directions if\nthe Coan is\nzero then many things can happen either\nthe data looks like this there's no\nrelation or maybe the data looks like\nthis not a normal distribution this is\nnot a distribution this is say\nprice and\nprofit for example what is the\nrelationship between price and profit by\nthe way\nprice huh so this is the theoretical\nrelationship between price and profit on\nthis side as price goes\nup your profit increases because you're\ngetting more money per product and on\nthis side with even higher price fewer\npeople buy your product so your profit\ngoes\ndown now for such a thing there when I\nthe average is somewhere here so the\ncorrelation also becomes zero another\nway to think of it is it's positive on\nthis side and negative on this side so\nif this is zero it doesn't mean that\nthere is no relationship it could mean\nthat there is a complicated relationship\nsomething that is positive on one side\nand negative on the other side and not\nthat\nsimple I once remember doing an analysis\num in which we were trying to find out\nit was about attrition why people leave\ncompanies and inside it there was a\nmodel that we were trying to for some\nreason trying to find out the\nrelationship between or trying to\nunderstand where people\nstay do they stay close to the office or\ndo they stay far away from office and\nnow what do you think is relationship\nbetween say\nexperience and distance to home higher\nThe Experience closer the\ndistance the\nexperience is the\nhome tenor or experience okay um we had\nnormalized for that in other words think\nof it as just experience but we were\nlooking at populations in which\nexperience Loosely translates to age but\nyou're right there could be people who\njoin join the company very old I agree\nwith that but let's simplify life and\nsay that you have a data set in which\nyou experience uh and here's what we\nfound\nthat that early on in their\ncareers people live close\nby in the middle they moved\naway and towards the end they again\nbecame\ncloser now this was an observation\nthere's no signs to this this was just\nsimply scene in that particular\ncompany this particular thing would\nhappen but remember the point is not to\ndescribe the point is also to predict to\nunderstand and things like that so we\nhad we had to build a story around this\nwhen we went to the CMD and said that\nyou know here's what we had done uh so\nso so you can make up a story around\nthis and the story we made up correctly\nor\nincorrectly I don't know is that in the\nbeginning to some extent people have low\ndependencies you typically coming you're\nunmarried Bachelor ET you're also ready\nto work a lot harder so staying close by\nis\nconvenient you get a PG or you get an\napartment you stay close to you stay\nclose to work because staying further\naway from work gets gets you no\nparticular benefit it's just\ninconvenient but as you as you reach in\nsome way Mele so to speak things become\nvery\ncomplicated there is a spouse here he\nshe may have a job there are kids there\nare schools there's kinds of houses that\nyou can afford and so this solves a more\ncomplicated optimization problem and you\nmay not be able to find a solution to\nthat problem close to\nwork but people who survive even longer\nin the company earn enough to solve this\nproblem through other\nmeans and then what happens is they move\nback to work\nagain you know bu a villa close to Etc\nand now there are multiple\ncars to take you know people elsewhere\nkids are often grown\nup so the number of dependencies are a\nlot less you may agree with the story\nyou may disagree with the story but the\npoint is that there's a complicated\nrelationship you're trying to explain\nbased on what the data is now the use of\nit I won't talk about much so this this\nnumber is a number whose sign positive\nor negative tells you about the nature\nof the\nrelationship but only the sign tells you\nthe value is much harder to\ninterpret the reason is because I can\nmeasure these things in what whatever\nunits I\nwant suppose I'm measuring you know you\nknow height say height and and weight\nand I measure height in in in centim and\nweight in kilog that's one answer but I\ncan measure height in feet and weight in\npounds and get a different answer I can\neven make this number Much Higher by\nmeasuring height in millimeters and\nweight in milligrams I don't know why I\ndo that but I get so this as a value is\na entirely dependent upon the units of\nmeasurement which makes it a problem so\nwhat statisticians do when they reach\nthis situation is that they normalize\nthings they make the unit go away so the\nway the unit goes away is you divide\nthis by the standard deviation of X and\nyou divide this by the standard\ndeviation of\nY now I can do this on the board without\nwriting anything again but I would\nsuggest you write the whole formula\nagain huh when I divide this by the\nstandard deviation of x the standard\ndevation of Y now the units cancel\nout now this value becoming one means XI\nis one standard deviation above\naverage in whatever beats units and Yi\nis say two standard deviations above\naverage in whatever its units the unit\nhas gone away this number is called the\ncorrelation between X and\nY and the correlation between X and Y is\na number between 0 and I'm sorry is a\nnumber between Min -1 and\n1 the\ncorrelation is between Min\n-1 and\none if the if the data looks like this\nthen it is one if the data looks like\nthis then it is minus\none this is the\ncorrelation it is a measure of the\nrelation reltionship between two\nvariables measured in this very peculiar\nway it is not just a measure of the\nrelationship it is a measure of what I\nwould say the linear relationship\nbetween X and Y a nonlinear relationship\nor a strange relationship could cancel\nout positive and negative and end up\nwith zero or a low\nnumber so if the correlation is close to\n+ one there is a strong positive\nrelationship between the two strong\npositive relation means what if one of\nthe variables is above average then the\nother is also very likely to be above\naverage and vice\nversa so what I can do\nis this is the when I do my data and I\ndo do core as a function\nright this gives what is called the\ncorrelation\nMatrix again it'll calculate it only for\nthe things with\nnumbers if it doesn't in other words if\nyou give it a data frame and this\ndoesn't happen then just make sure that\nyou only take the subset of it which has\nonly the numbers do not calculate\ncorrelations for things that aren't\nnumbers if they're not numbers there are\nother ways to calculate assoc iation\nwe'll see that later as\nwell now based on this what do you see\nfirst of all the correlation between age\nand age is\none why well it's a 45 Dee line\nright by definition it is one that this\nis a number that comes from one data set\nwith one kind of relationship what does\nthat say anything about the Practical\nworld so to speak it's another way of\nstating saying what I've been saying all\nalong how does your data have anything\nto say about these relationships outside\nthe\ndata the problem is a little clearer\nhere maybe but the problem exists for\nanything so for example there is a\ncorrelation of 28 between education and\nage H 28 means that there is a positive\nrelationship but a not a very strong\none where is that where is that\ngraph this is\nage education was a second one right\nso this one right or this one whichever\nway this shows that there is a weak\npositive relationship between\nthem when one goes up the other does\nhave a sight tendency of going up now I\nshould warn you that there is no sense\nof causation here there is no sense that\nif x goes up then y goes up because\ncorrelation of X and Y is the same as\nthe correlation of Y and\nX\ndefinition this is a symmetric concept\nit makes no attempt at causation that's\na different thing\naltogether so this is a positive this\nthese this is a positive relationship\nit's a weekly positive relation\nrelationship this is about usage and\neducation is about\n40.4 income and education is about 62\nmiles and usage is about 48 miles and\nfitness is about 78 let's see miles and\nfitness this is Miles and Fitness\nnothing in this data set has a negative\ncorrelation but you might have seen it\nif one was negatively correlated to the\nother negative related to the\nother close to\nzero you're looking for low correlations\nright so age and usage for example is a\nvery low\nnumber age and miles in other words age\ndoesn't seem to have much to do\nwith things shall we\nsay other than income but age and income\ndoesn't really have much to do with your\nproduct per se it'll be useful in when\nyou do clustering later on variables\nlike that are useful to try and\nsegment H Rich old\npeople always an interesting segment\nyes population is zero\ncorrelation means zero that there is no\nrelationship between the variables it\ncould mean for example that a plot that\nlooks like this let's pick a variable so\nuh closest to zero is what age and\nusage uh so age and usage is\nwhere usage\nand this one now this age and Miles that\nalso is prob thing low probab\nthis\none no there's no relationship between\nthem in the sense that there probably is\na relationship in the variability in\nother words there's more variability\nhere than here but if I want to draw a\nline through this the line doesn't have\na positive slope or a negative\nslope there's no there's no idea that\nsays that if one of them is above\naverage the other is also likely to be\nabove\naverage so low correlation means that\nthere is no sense that one being above\naverage Rel to the other being above\naverage no increasing no\ndecreasing correlations are notoriously\nhard numbers to interpret but they're\nalso very useful summaries particularly\nfor large\ndata the question that he asked is to\ndoes this make any sense in the real\nworld has two components to it component\none is your relationship between the two\nrelated to a linear\nconcept\nso for example uh I was talking about\nheight and weight what is the what\nshould be the relationship between\nheight and\nweight linear so if I plot height versus\nweight I should see a straight\nline\nokay how she's going to say not\nnecessarily\nokay removing outliers we're all\noutliers aren't we okay um have any of\nyou heard of a concept called the BMI\nbody mass index in this DNA you have all\nheard of body mass\nindex what is body mass\nindex height by height by\nby no there's no age in\nit height by weight squared height by\nweight squared\nnow so BMI is height by weight squared\nnow if BMI is height by weight squared\nwhat what does that tell you about the\nhuman body height by weight squared is\nwhat is called\nBMI and this number let's say should be\naround 25 if you are healthy what does\nthat tell\nyou if you are taller what will happen\nhow will your how should your weight\nincrease no there's a square\nhere half the half the rate so roughly\nthis should mean let's say that this is\ncorrect let's say roughly that this is\ncorrect if this is correct what does\nthat mean it means that height is\napproximately 25 into weight squared if\nyou're\nhealthy that means if I see a bunch of\nvery healthy people and I plot their\nheight versus the weight I should see a\ncurve like\nthat not a straight\nline she's figuring this she's saying\nnow why why why why if I'm twice as tall\nas should be twice as\nheavy yes if you want to give it a fancy\nname correct no you're right right right\nthat is a parabola undoubtedly\ntrue now you now you could argue as to\nwhy is it height by weight\nsquared that's a slightly different\nquestion why isn't it say weight by\nheight so let's suppose that you so\nweight by height means what so let's\nsuppose that these two they're not the\nsame\nwell let's suppose that there so so so\nso these two so this is a certain height\nthis is a certain height if I put this\non top of this what happens to the\nweight if these two are exactly the same\nthis is going to double or if I take two\nof these I don't see two of them I\napologize but anyway okay so here's one\nmore so these two so if I do if I put\nthis on top of this this doubles so\ntherefore if I look at objects such as\nthis then by doubling the weight and\ndoubling the height so height by weight\nit remains a constant correct\nso if I'm looking at BMI for bottles\nthis way it should be weight by\nheight so if you were a\nbottle your BMI would be weighed by\nheight okay now imagine that you are a\nfootball now if you're a football and\nyour height doubled how much bigger\nwould you\nbe\nyou understand the problem this is a\nfootball it is now twice as high how\nmuch heavier is\nit by factor of what huh by so the Vol\nheight has doubled volume has gone up by\nwhat no no huh p r what no 4 by3 P CU it\nhas grown up by by a cubic\nFactor so now for a ball the BMI should\nbe weight by height\ncubed so you're not growing like a\ncyinder\nand you're not growing like a\nfootball you're growing like something\nbetween a cylinder and a football we all\nare not you\npersonally\nso which is why it looks like\nthat right babies grow like\ncylinders we don't we don't grow like\nbecause if we grew like cylinders we'd\nbe a lot\nthinner think of yourself imagine\nyourself when you are you know five or\nsix and now double your height You' be a\nlot\nthinner right similarly you don't grow\nlike a you you don't you don't grow like\na football as well imagine you s five or\nsix and now imagine you grew in every\ndimension in the same way You' be a lot\nfatter than you are now so therefore\nthis relationship depends on the\nempirical relationship between height\nand weight for for the data that is\navailable which is of humans\ngrowing and so empirically people have\ndiscovered that this is the object that\nshould be\ninvariant this is an example of what's\ncalled Dimension\nreduction two variables are being\ncombined into one which is carrying\ninformation for you but it relies on a\nnonlinear relationship between the two\nthat is not going to be P only picked up\nby the\ncorrelation so the correlation goes so\nfar and no further it is not one of the\nmore analytically useful things very\noften we do test a hypothesis is the\ncorrelation Zero versus is the\ncorrelation not zero to ask whether the\ncorrelation is real or what is often\ncalled\nspurious and in a later class I think\nabout two or three residencies from now\nyou'll spend some time on things like\nspous correlations in other words I'm\nfinding a relationship between X and Y\nbut is it real or is it due to something\nelse it yes it could start as a basis\nfor a causation it it gives you some\nsummary of the data it is at best a\ndescriptive measure of\nAssociation sometimes people want to see\nit in in another form this is what's\ncalled a heat map it is exactly the same\nthing as a correlation except that in a\nheat map it gives you nice\ncolors it gives you nice colors and you\ncan change those colors so to speak um\nhere's the index of what the color\nis minus one is pale blue positive Etc\nand and positive was in the same\ndirection so it gives you a sense of\nwhat the color is so sometimes when you\nhave lots and lots of variables this is\ntwo fewer set of variables for a heat\nmap to be useful um so for example let's\nsuppose that you're looking at a product\ncatalog a few thousand products and\nyou're trying to find the correlation\nbetween sales of those products across\ntime and across geographies and you give\na display of you know where and so you\ndo a heat map and you find those regions\nwhere the products are sort of\nclustering up we often do it in medicine\nthrough what is called micro are we\nessentially we look at data from genes\nand let's say there are thousands of\ngenes and and you look at the expression\nlevels of each of these genes and you\nsay these are the genes that have been\nexpressed and these are the genes that\nhaven't been so if you are doing\ncorrelations of thousands of variables\nor hundreds of variables often a nice a\nnicely arranged set of variables with a\nheat map gives you a good picture of the\ndata so heat map in this form is exactly\nthe same as a correlation except that it\nadds colors to the numbers so that\nyou're not looking at the numbers you\nget a visual picture of\nit so the you so so so the traditional\nchoice of it is hot is related so red is\nrelated and white is\nnot but there are many ways in which you\ncan change the the coding of the heat\nmap\ncolors okay now comes to some extent a\ntool that is\ndescriptive however it is the first\npredictive tool that you will see I will\nnot want to use it like a predictive\ntool but I'll still show it so let me\nshow you what the end product\nis the end product is I want to\nsummarize the relationship between say\nmiles usage and fitness VAR like\nthese right now in predict in\nrelationships of varibles such as this\nkind here's an equation miles is equal\nto -\n5.75 + 20 into usage + 27 into\nfitness this is shall we say a targeted\nequation what is this equation as far as\nI'm concerned today this is this is a\ndescription of the\ndata but the description of the data\nwill be used in order to predict how\nmany miles my instrument will\nrun so think of what the instrument is\nthe instrument is going to be is an\nengineer designed instrument and I'm\ntrying to figure out how much it will be\nused how many miles it will be used to\ndo that I will figure out whether people\nconsider themselves fit or not and how\nfrequently they use it\nand using that I want to get an equation\nfor the number of miles this will\nrun is there a descriptive way of\ngetting at that\nequation so what this does this kind of\nan equation is what's called a linear\nregression\nmodel this is your first\nmodel this is going from descriptive\nto\npredictive I haven't run it yet I\nhaven't run it yet I'm just saying what\nI'm trying to\ndo self-rated Fitness on a one to5\nscale I'll get there so maybe I\nshouldn't have shown you the output\nalways dangerous to show good people\noutput never show output moral of the\nstory so so what I want to do\nis keep it deliciously vague huh so Y is\nequal to Beta plus beta 1 X1 plus beta 2\nX2 I want to fit an equation of that\ntype why do we have multiple variables I\ncan do it with one variable maybe life\nis simpler with one variable you have\ngiven\nme\nso you can you can in the code AS you'll\nsee you can you have one variable you\ncan have two variables you can three\nvariables you can have any number of\nvariables I think they've chosen two to\nsay that you I once had um we going from\nbyar distribution multivar distribution\nso he did all of byari distributions\nthen at the end he said now put 2 equal\nto\nn and we were telling him sir it doesn't\nwork that way if you do it for N I can\nput n equal to two but if you want me to\nput 2 equal to n in which two do I put\nwhich n h so he's saying I'll show you\nit for two but if I show it for two you\ncan do it for one and then you can do it\nfor three you can do it for any but we\ncan try it for one also if you want\nto so let's look at that and what what\nwhat am I trying to put\nhere I'm trying to\nput miles\nhere and I'm trying to put usage here\nand I'm trying to put Fitness here I\nforget which was where but anyway these\ntwo\nvariables how am I using it to describe\nso you want to you might want to think\nof it this way if I give you three\nvariables how do do I describe the\nrelationship between\nthem if I give you three variables how\ndo I describe the relationship between\nthem there are three\nvariables in the form of something like\nthat is one way of doing\nit now does that mean that in reality as\nyou might say that there is a\nrelationship between these three things\nno correctly so receiving prise maybe I\ndon't know not\nnecessarily correct not necessarily\nso when you do linear regression in the\nfuture any regression for that matter\nthere will be three uses of it use one\nit is simply\ndescriptive it will simply describe the\nnature of the relationship to you it\nwill make no causal inference no sense\nthat this causes this it it will give\nyou no predictive model it simply\ndescribes and we'll discuss how it\ndescribes two it predicts predicts means\nwhen I put in another value of\nx and another value of X1 and another\nvalue of X2 I will get a different value\nof y which means that I've looked at\ndata from all of you and a new person\ncomes into the room with a new X1 and X2\nand I'll put then her her number in and\nI will predict her why that is the\npredictive use of the of a Mor\nthird\nprescriptive in order to get a different\ntargeted\nY what changes should I make in my X X1\nand\nX2 to get different usage of the\nequipment what behavioral changes do I\nneed to make in people to get them to\nuse more an even more complicated use of\nthe same thing so the same model the\nsame principle can be used for different\nuses I am using it simply as a\ndescription simply as a way to\nsummarize not\nunivariate not\nbivariate but trivariate or\nmultivariate I can do that with the 3X3\ncorrelation\nMatrix but if I choose to do it this way\nnow where is my where is the what number\nam I looking\nfor Fitness is is here average number of\nmiles a customer expects to walk or run\naverage number of times the customer\nplans to use so I'm going to give it\nthis variable and this variable and try\nand get an outcome for the middle\none getting it the way to do it is\nsomething that I won't talk about too\nmuch so there's a there's there's\nthere's SK learn which is you know one\nof the one of the learning modules that\nthey learn in the sense of supervised\nlearning import linear model regression\nlinear model as a function and the\nslightly irritating big function here\ncalled linear model which is inherited\nfrom linear model you're giving it a y\nwhat is the Y the thing on the left hand\nside of the equation what is the X the\nthing on the right hand side of the\nequation what is r fit r fit means\nregression\nfit\nH and this fits my X and Y and this\noutputs something it doesn't output\nanything at this point in\ntime now I have my regression\ncoefficients and my regression\ncoefficients are 20 and 27 my regression\nintercept is - 56 and my mil predictor\nis - 56.5 4 + 20 usage plus 27 Fitness\nhow is this interpreted from a purely\ndescriptive perspective\nit means that for\nexample if usage Remains the\nSame and my fitness goes up by one\nunit then my miles goes up by\n27 if my fitness Remains the Same and my\nusage goes up by say 1 hour or one unit\nthen my miles goes up by\n20 what does minus 56 means if you don't\nuse it at all and you have zero Fitness\nyou have run minus 56\nmiles makes no sense but nether does\nzero\nFitness so the model is not necessarily\nwritten in a way in which this intercept\nmakes sense which is why in the software\nThe Intercept is not treated as a\ncoefficient The Intercept is a part of\nthe equation but is not one of the\ncoefficients that you\ninterpret this is pure\ndescription how does it how does it what\ndoes it do in case you are asking can I\nhope you\ndon't what it does is\nthis what it does is it looks at the\ndata and what is my data my data is say\ny1 X1 X2 and it says this it looks at y1\nsorry Yi minus beta minus beta 1 X1 i -\nbeta 2 X2 I whole SAR this is my\nprediction or the equation beta KN plus\nbeta 1 X1 plus beta 2 X2 this is my\nactual what prediction is the closest to\nmy actual in what sense find the\ndifference between the prediction and\nthe actual Square it and then minimize\nit with respect to beta 1 beta not beta\n1 and beta 2 so what are bet beta not\nbeta 1 and beta\n2 their variables or their parameters\nthat are estimated in such a way that if\nI estimated this way this plane is the\nclosest to the\ndata in what sense in the sense that the\ndifference between the predicted and the\nactual is the smallest don't worry you\nwill do this\nagain you will do this again this is a\nvery important thing in supervised\nlearning in prediction mode in\ndescription mode all that is necessary\nfor this to happen is that it describes\nthe nature of the relationship between\nmiles usage and fitness describes in\nwhat way in addition to the\ninterpretation of the numbers there's\nalso something else interesting here the\npositive sign what does the positive\nsign mean it means that as Fitness goes\nup miles goes up as usage goes up miles\ngoes summarize the relationship between\nthree variables treating one of them as\na\noutput this is a descriptive use of\nlinear\nregression as a way to describe data is\nthe description\nreal to be\ndecided to be confirmed to be\nanalyzed to be\nunderstood right you do not know it is\nempirical\nit is based on data why is it why is it\nnecessarily\ntrue is there a logical reason why this\nis to be the case yes you can do it with\none you can do it with you can remove\nit so if I remove it what\nhappens so what would you do you guys\ncan do it with there you would move it\nhere instead of instead of usage and\nfitness just have one of them there I\nhave not given you any idea as to\nwhether the description is\ngood I've not told you whether this\nmodel is a good model or a good equation\nin the same way that I did not tell you\nwhether the correlation was good or\nwhether the mean was\ngood I've not given any quality\nassessment to\nanything these are ways to\ndescribe the quality of the model how\naccurate is my mean how good is my\nprediction these are things that are\ngoing to be inference and pred we'll\ncome we can't answer those questions\nbefore we get to probability the middle\nhere sense of language on it\nyes\nH Fitness and usage\nas h\nHuh huh that's true so you're saying\nthat it it doesn't make sense for\ncertain values which is true which may\nwell be as I said I am not saying that\nthis is a good predictive model what\nwill happen is you will you will what\nwill happen you will study a model like\nthis and you'll ask certain\nquestions what questions might you ask\nfor example here's a question that you\nwould ask you asked a question that if I\nfit a model like that is this\ncoefficient that is in front of this\nvariable actually equal to\nzero because if it is actually equal to\nzero\nthen there is no relationship between\nthe output and that\nvariable so what we do is we ask for a\nstatement of this kind if say Yi is\nequal to Beta + beta 1 X1 + beta 2 X2 I\nasked for the statement is beta 1 equal\nto\nZ and these are called\nhypothesis because if beta 1 is zero\nthen this number should not be in the\nmodel and therefore this variable has no\npredictive power over this variable\nwhich is where the analytics part\nbecomes\ninteresting but to answer that question\nI need to have a sense of how do I know\nwhether this is zero or\nnot and to answer that question I need\nto have a sense of what the error around\nthat number is so this number is not 20\nit is 20 plus minus\nsomething in the same way that my mean\nof 28 age of 28 was not 28 it was 28\nplusus something this is also similarly\nnot 20 it is 20 plusus something and if\nthat plus minus something includes zero\nthen I can't say that this is not\nzero if on the other hand that plus\nminus does not include zero I can\nsay it's a predictive model that's\ncoming but for now this is simply a way\nto describe\ndata and like for means like for\ncorrelations like for standard\ndeviations and for linear regression all\nof these all will now see an inferential\nphase to them the mean must see a plus\nminus the regression coefficient must\nnow see a test is it equal to zero or is\nit not equal to zero all these models\nall these estimates will now be put into\nan inferential test into predictive test\nhow is how useful is it for new\ndata because just describing current\ndata is not going to be good enough for\nme I'm writing an equation like\nthis I want to write this\nequation I want to write\nmiles is equal to Beta KN plus beta 1\ninto\nusage plus beta 2 into\nfitness I want to write\nthis the code now tells me what these\nnumbers\nare this number is -\n56 this number is plus 20 and the third\nnumber is plus\n[Music]\n27 that's it you can call it intercept\nbased on what your whatever your term is\nyes yes yes in X just put in another\nvariable do comma another variable it\ncan be any\nnumber try it out I mean you can do it\nnow if I don't want to FID around with\nthis I won't plot it my Purp Pur is to\nif I could plot it I would but remember\nthere are three\nvariables remember there are three\nvariables why am I doing this because in\ntwo variables I can plot it I can also\nlook at many variables at a time and see\na correlation but if I have three\nvariables plotting things becomes\ndifficult if I have four variables\nplotting things becomes even more\ndifficult but you still do it I think\nyou have Tableau or in your um\ncurriculum maybe I'm not sure but\nvisualization technique can still help\nyou but if you got a 10 variables then\nplotting is not a way to do it so how do\nI express the relationship between 10\nvariables by arbitrary equations like\nthis what does it mean this intercept is\nif this is zero and this is zero what is\nthis but as we had said this zero\ndoesn't make sense and this zero doesn't\nmake\nsense but this this is simply a line\nthat goes through the data if I have\ndata that looks like this for example\nall it does is it fits this straight\nline what is The Intercept where it cuts\nthis axis does it make any sense maybe\nmaybe not this is the place where the\ndata makes sense but the equation is\nwritten so that it cuts the line\nhere correct if I find a relationship\nbetween height and weight and I write\nthe equation as Y is equal to bet or say\nweight sorry is equal to Beta\nplus beta 1 into height what is beta 1\nbeta 1 is the weight of someone who has\nheight\nzero makes no sense right but giving me\nthe freedom to have a beta 1 here allows\nme to get a much better line because I\ncan move this line up and down in order\nto get the best\nfit it allows me an extra\nflexibility don't\nworry in fitting good models you will\nhave enough experience in doing this my\npurpose is just to show you it as a way\nto describe three variables in one shot\nI am again I'm not building a models if\nI do it for two of them just miles and\nusage just just two of them this is an\nequation an equation just of this\nkind with one variable you wouldn't do\nthis because there's nothing to model\nright there's no equation between one\nvariable criteria for doing this\nremember my purpose is not to use this\nto select which variable to model when\nI'm calculating means and standard\ndeviations and correlations I'm not\nusing them to select anything I'm not\nsaying that I will measure your mean\nbecause you're important or I'll measure\nyour standard deviation because you're\nlow I'm using this as a tool to\nsummarize three or four variables which\nvariables to use where in predictive\nmode you can do you can look at for high\ncorrelations and there are many other\ntechniques that you learn in order to\nfigure it out so just like a mean is a\nway to do\nanalytics correlation is a way to do\nanalytics stand deviation is\nsimilarly uh so what we had done\nyesterday is we had spoken essentially\nabout descriptive statistics and\ndescriptive statistics\nis the taking of data and to Simply\ndescribe\nit with the later purpose of either\nvisualizing it or writing a report or\nusing it for inference and prediction in\nlater courses or later\napplications it is compared with um\npredictive statistics or Predictive\nAnalytics and then prescriptive\ndescribing is simply a a task of\nsummarizing ing a given set of numbers\nuh you'll do sessions in\nvisualization in due\ncourse prediction is a task that is uh\noften in uh machine learning or a data\nmining professionals requirement to say\nthat if something changes then what\nhappens uh I should have made a comment\nthat there are two English language\nwords that mean more or less the same\nthing one is forecasting and one is\nprediction um in the machine learning\nWorld these words are used a little\ndifferently forecasting is is usually in\nthe context of time so something has\nhappened in the past what will happen in\nthe future I'm giving you this week what\nwill happen next week forecasting in the\nfuture prediction is usually used\nwithout any sense of time prediction is\nlike I'm giving you an X you give me a y\nso I'm giving you one variable you give\nme a another variable so Predictive\nAnalytics\ndoesn't necessarily forecast\nanything despite the fact prediction\nitself is about\nforecasting uh so the words mean\nslightly different\nthings uh it's a little like you know\nprice and worth mean more or less the\nsame thing but Priceless and worthless\nmean different\nthings so so the words are used in\nslightly different context so in\ndescriptive statistics um we had looked\nat certain ways of doing things for\nexample we had looked at what is called\nunivariate\nData univariate means one variable for\nthe univariate distributions we had seen\ncertain kinds of descriptive statistics\nsome of them were about shall we say\nlocation location meant where is the\ndistribution and we had seen for example\nthings like means and\nmedians which talked about where is the\ndistribution\nlocated we talked about things on\nvariation where we have talked about\nstandard deviation we'll talk more about\nthings like this\ntoday standard\ndeviation um\nRange inter quartile\nrange here also we had terms for example\nlike you know the quartiles the upper\nquartile the lower\nquartile these are parameters that are\nused in order to convey a message to\nsomeone saying that what is the data\nabout so for example a five point\nsummary talks about the minimum the 25%\npoint the 50% point the 75% point and\nthe\nmaximum irrespective of the number of\ndata points you could have 10 of them\nyou could have a 100 of them you could\nhave a million of them you could have a\nbillion of them it doesn't matter it's\nstill five\nnumbers uh sometimes those five numbers\ntell a lot they tell about location they\ntell about spread they talk about\nskewness is the distribution sort of\ntilted towards one side is there more\ndata on this side than on the other in\nterms of the data spreading out towards\nthe\ntales so and so there are plots\nassociated with this as well we talk a\nlittle a little bit about the plots\nlater then we went towards the end\ntowards the idea of let's say bivariate\ndata by variate means that there are two\nvariables in which we didn't spend a lot\nof time we talked about\nco-variance and\ncorrelation covariance is a sense of\nvariability of two variables\ntogether uh its univariate version is a\nvariance\nwhich is the square of the standard\ndeviation a scaled version of cence is\nthe correlation if the correlation is is\nclose to plus one then it means that\nthere is a strong positive relationship\nbetween the variables positive means if\none goes up the other also goes up if\none goes down the other also goes down\nnegative means the opposite as one goes\nup the other goes down correlation is\nnot to be confused with causation there\nis nothing in the descriptive world that\nsays that this causes this there's no\nsign sence to this this is simple\ndescription the science to it and the\nlogic to it and the use of it for for\ninference for for for business logic and\nthings like that will come a little\nlater for now we are simply\ndescribing then we have taken an even\nbrief and perhaps even more\nconfusing look at multivariate our first\nmultivariate summary where we looked at\nthe idea of a linear\nregression\na linear regression is an equation of\nthe form Y is equal to say beta plus\nbeta1\nX1 plus beta P XP where one variable is\nwritten as an\nequation of the\nothers this is nearly done to describe\nthe nature of the relationship between\nthe\nvariables correct it can be used for\nprediction it can be used for\nprescription if you want it to but that\nis not our purpose here our purpose is\nsimply to describe a\nrelationship why is this useful because\nlet's say that you've got three\nvariables four variables 10 variables\nyou need a mechanism to say how these\nvariables are connected how do you\ndescribe 10 things at a time there are\nGraphics out there there are famous\nGraphics in history where you have uh\nmany variables being represented in in\non one plot or one\nvisualization so visualizing things\nitself so for example we looked at a\ncertain kinds of\nplots we looked at for example\nhistograms we looked at box\nplots sort of\npairs which were essentially scatter\nwhat are called Scatter\nPlots so these are for the human eye\nthese are things for the human eye to to\nsee\ndata and they have the limitations\nbecause we can only see data in a\ncertain way we can't see very high\ndimensional data visually we can see up\nto three dimensions\nmaybe uh for those of you who are\ninterested about such things or any of\nyou are in the graphics World Etc you\nspend a lot of time saying how do I how\ncan I make people see things um so how\nmany dimensions can you actually plot in\nuh python itself is is good at it uh but\nthere are other devices so for example\nlet's say that you're plotting you can\nhave of course one variable as x one\nvariable as y um another dimension can\nbe maybe the the size of the plot you\nknow if this is bigger then another\nvariable Zed becomes larger it can be a\ncolor like a heat map a fourth variable\nif it is low can be blue and if it is\nhigh can be red another may be the shape\nof it lower values are circles higher\nvalues are more\npointy so there many ways in which you\ncan get summarization to be\ndone so um when you do visualization if\nyou do you'll see other ways of\nsummarizing it but if you want to do it\nas a number then something like an\nequation that looks like this is often a\ngood representation how one gets at\nthese beta 1es and beta PS I I explained\nvery briefly what happens is you you\nform this equation and you take those\nvalues of beta beta 1 and beta P that\nare closest in some sense to the data so\nif I draw a picture of say two of\nthem y on X and I say give me a\nline which line should I take take the\ndistance from the line to the\npoints and make this distance the\nsmallest get a line that goes through\nthe data with the smallest distance to\nthe\npoints how is small measured small is\nmeasured by the square of these\ndistances because distance on the above\nthe line and distance in below the line\nare\nequivalent so if this is my Beta plus\nbeta 1 x and this is my Y what I do is I\nlook at y minus or y i minus beta minus\nbeta 1 x i\nI is equal to 1 to n my N Point Square\nit this is the squar of the distances\nfrom the line and then I minimize this\nwith respect to Beta KN and beta 1 that\nis how I get the numbers but if you're\nsimply interested in what python or R\ndoes then the program will simply give\nyou what the number is so what those\nwill give minu of beta 0 bet what sorry\nwhat I will get it from those you will\nget the Val value of beta not and beta\n1 find the value of beta not and beta 1\nsuch that this is the\nsmallest f for different values of beta\nnot and beta 1 this distance will be\ndifferent for different\nlines this distance from the line will\nbe\ndifferent which line will I take the\nline such that this is the\nsmallest how to get the beta\nso take form this y IUS beta minus beta\n1 x i s on a plot actually that points\nare where the point existed the point is\nhere the points are here so these line\nline is basically which the line is a\nline I'm trying to\nfind here is a point here is a point\nhere is here is a point here is a\npoint here is a point right let's say\nFive\nPoints I want to describe the\nrelationship between these Five\nPoints therefore what I need to do is I\nneed to find a line that goes through\nthese\npoints I want to write an equation of\nthe type Y is equal to say I'll remove\nthe B and X Y is equal to a plus BX I\nwant a line like a plus VX going through\nthose points there are many\nlines this is one line this is one line\nthis is one line this is one line\nthey're all lines which line will I use\nto represent the relationship between Y\nand\nX I need a\ncriteria so what I do is I try to say\nlet me find a line let's say that this\nis the line and find out how good it\nis at this describing the\ndata now when is it good at describing\nthe\ndata when it passes close to the\npoints because that is his purpose to\ndescribe the data because I want to say\nthat this\nline without any data points is a\ndescription of the data but how to get\nthat line position that's what I'm\ntalking\nabout so I need the value of a and\nb correct so how do I find the value of\na and\nb for every such line A and\nB I find the distance of the points to\nthe\nline so if there how many points do I\nhave here I've got five points I've got\nfive\ndistances what are the points this is\nthe point X1\ny1 this is the point say X2\nY2 X3\nY3 X4\ny4 and X5\ny5 these are my Five\nPoints how far is the point X1 y1 from\nthe\nline This\ndistance and what is this\ndistance this distance is how\nmuch this distance\nis this point is\ny1 minus what is this\npoint a so\nA+ B\nX1 that's the point on the\nline\ncorrect okay I can stop here but if I\nstop here what will happen is that if\nthis is the distance then this will\nbecome a negative distance and this will\nbecome a positive distance and they will\ncancel or neutralize as you say Sir a is\nwhich point which is from that point to\nthe line actually that is the a distance\nno a is this\nequation a is the equation of the\nline you want to know what the term a is\na is this\npoint B is this\nslope and I want to find a and b\nso this equation is a + BX so this point\nis y and this length of this line is y -\nA +\nbx1\nsquared plus for the second one what is\nit for the second one Y2 - a - b X2\nwhole s\ndo\nthis five\ntimes\ncorrect for every line you will get this\nnumber if you want to you can take a\nsquare root for every line you will get\nthis number this number is the sum of\nsquare distances of the line from the\ndata it tells you how far the line is\nfrom the\ndata the larger this number is the\nfurther the line is from the\ndata the smaller this number is the\ncloser it is to the\ndata if it is if the data is on the line\nwhat is the value of this zero so if\nevery point is on the line or if the\ndata is itself a straight line then this\nwill be zero\nso I have formed this now I find the\nvalue of a and b such that that is the\nsmallest for every A and B I will get a\nvalue like this if I take another line I\nwill get another value of\nthis for every choice of A and B I will\nget a difference distance from the data\nwhich A and B will I\npick that A and B such that this\ndistance becomes the smallest so can we\nhave a issue where the algorithm means\ncomputationally we don't find you don't\nvalue of which can kind of minimize me\nthe kind of uh okay so let me finish\nthis so choose a and\nb to\nminimize\nthis\nand that is the A and B that the\nsoftware gives\nyou this is called a linear regression\nright answer to does it have a pro does\nit have a Le Square this is why gaus was\nso successful and laas was not you will\nget a unique solution this what called a\nconvex\nproblem and this is a convex\noptimization because of the\nsquaring if you have modulus values here\nthere is a possibility that you'll not\nget a single\nanswer but because of this and because\nof this square and because of the nice\nb-shaped curve that the square function\ngives you you will find a unique\nsolution to this so how many times\nsystem tries the number of data point no\nthe system doesn't do it that way the\nway the system does it is the system\ndifferentiates this with respect to A\nand\nB differentiates with respect to a sets\nequal to zero differentiate respect to B\nsets equal to Z Z and solves those two\nequations it doesn't\nminimize it doesn't minimize when this\nbecomes very high\ndimensional this minimization this\ndifferentiation of solving it becomes a\nvery interesting problem in mathematics\nin numerical\nanalysis to do that you need typically\nto do linear algebra and in courses such\nas this and in machine learning books\nyou will see at the beginning of the\nbook you'll often find Chapters on\noptimization and linear algebra\nbecause of this or something similar to\nthis that to represent a problem you\noften need a matrix\nrepresentation and to get a a good\nlearned solution you need an\noptimization so most machine learning\nalgorithms are built that way because\nfor as I was saying yesterday that\nyou're going to tell someone to do\nsomething you're going to tell a car to\nbehave itself on the\nroad yesterday while going back today\nmorning I heard that or I read that BMW\nand dler are setting up a you know 1\nbillion Euro R&D operation somewhere in\nEurope for self-driving cars etc\netc two different Industries are trying\nto go towards making cars that don't\nneed people the automobile industry is\nas well as the ride healing\nindustry people like uh Uber and Lyft\nand Ola and these\ncompanies so now you're going to figure\nout the car is now going to have to be\ntold when to go and when to stop but how\ndoes the car know that it has a good\nrule how does it know that it has\nlearned and what is good learning as\nopposed to bad learning what is enough\nlearning as opposed to not enough\nlearning a computer is\nstupid all a computer can do is store a\nlot of data and do calculations quickly\ncomputers aren't\nintelligent to make the computer\nintelligent you have to give it an\nintelligent function you have to say\nOkay run your algorithm such that this\nthing becomes the highest it can be or\nthis thing becomes the lowest it can be\nwhich is an optimization\nproblem so what machine learning\nalgorithms almost invariably do is they\nsay that here is an input and here is an\noutput give me an algorithm such that\nbased on the input you can come closest\nto the\noutput for example object\nrecognition if I'm if I'm teaching\ncomputer vision or if I'm teaching text\nrecognition or any of these let's say\ntext recognition so I'm trying to\nunderstand what a word what the word\nis so so I'm the computer is reading\nsomething let's say in in\nhandwriting and he trying to identify\nthat as an English language or or a\nCanada or a Hindi\nphrase so it's going to write something\ndown you write this and in my horrible\nhandwriting I'll write something and\nthat camera has to recognize what I\nwrote and transcribe it into something\nthat you can\nread now how does it know it's done a\ngood job what it needs to know is that\nthis is what I think the word is and\nthis is what the correct word is now\ntell me whether I'm\nclose and if I'm close I'm good if I'm\nnot close I'm not good but this has to\nwork not just for one word this has to\nwork for thousands of\nwords so I must be close to thousands of\nwords at the same\ntime therefore I need to measure the\ndistance from my prediction and my\nactuality over many many data points\nso all these algorithms what they do is\nthey take your prediction and they\ncompare with the actuality and they find\na distance between them and they\nminimize the totality of the distance\nbetween the prediction the actual and an\nalgorithm that minimizes that distance\nis a good algorithm it has learned\nwell so they all do something like\nthis with this is the prediction and\nthis is the\nactual and a and b are the parameters in\nthe in the prediction\nin other words find a prediction such\nthat it is closest to the\nactual so this algorithm has become very\npopular it's probably the single most\npopular fitting algorithm out there this\nis called Le\nsquares least squares\nH this is called least\nsquares squares here's a Square least\nbecause you are minimizing it's called\nleast squares and the least squares\nalgorithm is a very standard way of\ndoing things this has nothing to do with\nthe algorithm\nitself the algorithm can be anything\nthis itself can be a neural network it\ncan be a support Vector machine it can\nbe a random Forest it can be Association\nrule it can be any of your\nLogics but the question is if you give\nme the program how do I know whether the\nprogram is\ngood\nso I give it what's called training data\ntraining data means I tell it what the\nright answer\nis sir yes this we can infer that this\nis the starting point of basically what\nthe prediction and what that we are\ncomparing and getting the result of that\nyes so this is the prediction this line\nis a prediction if you want to think of\nit the data points are the\nactuality the problem is this these dat\npoints are also not the\nactuality the actuality is going to come\nin the\nfuture it is a training set for the data\nit is the it is the the data that has\nbeen given to the algorithm to train\nit but is not the algor it is not the\ndata that the data will actually run on\nthe car will run on the road the car\nwill see its data points its people and\nother cars and the cows and whatever for\nthe first time it will not have seen\nthat data before\nbut it will need to know what to\ndo starting on learning basically yes so\nwhat do you do so what you do is you\ntrain the\nalgorithm what does training the\nalgorithm mean training the algorithm\nmeans you give it data for which the car\nis told what to do in other words you\ngive it what they call Ground truth so\nyou give it the why and you say here is\nthe data or here is the situation please\ndo the right\nthing so please do it such as this so\nhere's a person who's Crossing the\nroad please stop here is another person\ncrossing the road but he's very far\naway calculate the distance compare with\nyour speed and decide what to do he may\nbe far enough for you to be able to see\nbut you may not stop if you are driving\na car it's quite possible that you are\nseeing someone crossing the road but\nmaybe about close to 100 met ahead and\nyou're not slowing down because you're\ndoing the calculation that I have a\nspeed the person crossing the road also\nhas a speed and by the time I get there\nthis person would have gone do not do\nthis when doing a level\ncrossing but we all do this all the time\nwe do this when crossing the road so I'm\nhappily doing that there is a car coming\nbut I'm still crossing the road why\nbecause I know that I'll be able to\ncross the\nroad before I get there so the car needs\nto be taught how to do these things so\nthis data it's given data like this and\nsays for the training data get as close\nas you possibly can to the training\ndata and then it's given what's called\ntest data and now the algorithm is told\noh now I'm going to give you new data\nand now you're going to tell me how well\nyou did on new\ndata so suppose you were given a problem\nlike this I'm not supposed to talk about\nthis your your ml instructors are\nsupposed to talk about this but suppose\nyou given a problem like this in other\nwords I've given you a data set and I'm\ngoing to tell you that your performance\nwill be judged not by this this data set\nbut on another data set that I am not\ngiving\nyou how will you what will you do how\nwill you make your program\nready generaliz yes so how how will you\nmake your program\ngeneralizable so the usual way it's done\nis something interesting you say that\nokay you want me to predict data that I\nhave not seen I will see if I can do\nthat so what you do is all the data that\nis available you take a certain part of\nit and you keep it aside you have it but\nyou don't use it and now the remaining\npart of the data you build your\nalgorithm on and now you test it on the\nkind of data that you yourself have but\nhave kept aside this is called\nvalidation\ndata and now if your algorithm works on\nyour own heldout data that data that\nyour algorithm is not seen you are more\nhopeful that it will work on somebody\nelse's new\ndata this called validation and this\nentire cycle is often called test\nvalidate train or or train validate test\nEtc\nand you will do this in your\nhackathons but to do this the algorithm\nneeds to know as to how good it is and\nit needs measures like this there are\nother measures so for example if you're\nclassifying an algorithm good or bad\npositive sentiment on tweet or negative\nsentiment on tweet no numbers then you\ndo not need this what you need is simply\nare you correct or are you\nincorrect if it is correct let's say you\ngive yourself zero distance if it is\nincorrect let's say you give yourself\none distance in other words you made one\nerror and you just count how many\nmistakes you made but what is a mistake\nwhen it comes to estimating a number\nlike say miles and things like that\nthere's no mistake you're either close\nor you are far so you need to measure of\nhow close that's a measure of how\nclose so this descriptive method is used\nas a criteria for building predictive\nmodels this itself can be a predictive\nmodel but very rarely is it good enough\ntoo few things in the world are this\nsimple are they things in the world this\nsimple\nyes but as we said as we discussed\nyesterday even things like height and\nweight are not that\nsimple there are complexities to that so\nfor example you can have theories we\nsaid for example you could say uh let's\nsay a savings rate what's a savings rate\na savings rate is the proportion of\nmoney that you save now if there is a\nsavings State what that would mean is\nthat you if I take your income data and\nI take your consumption data that should\nform a straight\nline because you're saving up the same\nproportion every month but it's\nnot if you go home and month by month\nyou figured out what what your income\nwas fairly precisely from your salary or\nfrom other sources etc etc and you also\nplot again fairly precisely as you can\nhow much you you your household spend\nthat month\nit will have an increasing effect\nprobably but it it's very very unlikely\nto be a straight line in certain things\nyou may be going after a law of physics\nbut the law of physics May hold for\nGravity may not hold for anything\nelse I remember trying to apply this so\none day one day Cricket sort of became\npopular when I was in school or\nthereabouts and one calculation was done\nas to as to how to figure out whether a\na team is doing well or or how well is a\nChase going so one point possibility is\nto Simply track the score the other\npossibility is to say that if you know\nhow many runs you're going to get you\ntend to begin slow protective wickets\nand you accelerate so what you do is you\nbuild models for that you build models\nby saying that let me assume that the\nteam is going to accelerate\nconstantly which means that every over\nthat comes later it's going to\ndo it's going to get better its run rate\nis going to keep increasing steadily now\nif its run rate keeps increasing\nsteadily then when will it reach the\nhalfway\npoint that is the same thing is asking\nthe question that if I take a ball and I\ndrop it how long will it take to get to\nthe halfway point and there's a square\nroot term there and the answer is about\n50 divid by the square root of two about\nthe 37th over or something of that\nsort so effectively the logic was if at\nif if you have reached halfway point\nbelow let's say the 37th over or so you\nare on\ntrack if not you need to accelerate a\nlittle faster that's using a physical\nlaw to try and predict something that is\nnot a physical\nlaw and the laws of physics do not apply\nto CRI Cricket at least not in this way\nthat I'm\ndescribing so therefore these laws will\nget you somewhere like a straight line\netc etc but they are\napproximations and so what you will do\nis you'll build better versions of this\nwhen you use it for an actual prediction\nbut the same argument holds for things\nlike mean standard deviations and many\nsuch things if there's a specific\nproblem you need to solve you may make\nget a better estimate for doing it yes\nsomeone had was asking a question\nquestion that\nyine yes then what the B is actually\nthat what we talked about so so there\nare many ways to do that one is you just\nput it in you you find for different\nvalues of A and B you find what that\nnumber is and then you solve it if you\nwant to do it the hard way you can still\ndo it the hard way and the hard way will\nend up being something like this I'm\nminimizing and I should not be talking\nabout\nthis say Yi - beta minus beta 1 x i squ\nI was using a and b right so say A and B\nwhole squ I'm going to minimize this\nwith respect to A and B so essentially\nwhat I'm going to do is I'm going to\ncall this let's say l Of A and\nB\nand I will say DDA of L A is equal to\nZ ddb of lb is equal to Zer and this\nwill and I will solve these and this\nwill give me two interesting\nequations and my answers will be this\nI'll tell you what the answer is your B\nhat your estimate of\nB your estimator B will be this\nsummation x i - xar y i - Y Bar divided\nby summation x i - xar\ns and your a will be\nthis Y Bar minus B hat xar so if you\nwant formulas these are your\nformulas because I'm minimizing\nsomething\nto minimize something is the same thing\nas setting as derivative zero now that\nis also the same as maximizing something\nbut this is where convex optimization\ncomes in that this will have a minimum\nbut will won't have a maximum so by\nsetting it equal to zero I'm going to\narrive at the\nminimum yes the minimum will come with\nrespect to a right not with respect to X\nand yes X and Y are fixed the data is\nfixed the parameter is\nvarying the range is\nX and Y are fixed for my data correct so\nmy B is written in terms of a\nand so this is a Formula if you want to\nclose it this can also be written as the\nco Varian of X and Y divided by the\nvariance of\nX so if you want to calculate it for two\nvariables what you need to do is you\nneed to calculate the covariance and\ndivide by the variance and here Y Bar\nminus B xar this means that the that the\nthat the line passes through xar Y Bar\nthe line passes through the middle of\nthe\ndata with the Der the minimum will be we\nare minimizing a right we minimizing\nwith respect to a a is a\nvariable\nhow\nMin how it will do\nthis so for different values of A and B\nthe distance will look like this there's\na particular value of a and b in which\nthe distance will be this there's\nanother value of a and b in which the\ndistance will be this there's a\nparticular value of a and b in which the\ndistance will be this that is\ncorresponding to the cor this is this is\nmy my uh summation Yi - a - bxi\ns this value for different values of A\nand B I will get\nthis\nso when I minimize this now to do this\nyou don't need to do it all you need to\ndo if you want to do it if you want to\ndo it is\nthis if you want to do if you want to do\nit do this do you have yesterday's\ncode open it you can do\nit then right now that's it you\nstop is like saying I get the mean then\nwhat\none use of it is to predict another use\nof it is to prescribe there are many\nuses of it a third use is to do nothing\nbut simply to use it to to visualize or\nto summarize the relationship between\ntwo\nvariables correct and we do this all the\ntime so um so for\nexample how do you measure how price\nsensitive your product\nis do you understand the question you\ntrying to you're trying to change the\nprice of your\nproduct why would you want to change the\nprice of your\nproduct profitability maybe you want to\nincrease it so that you get more\nmoney so people in marketing often want\nto understand how\nsensitive my sales are to\nprice now to do that they come up with\nvarious kinds of measures one particular\nmeasure is what is called the elasticity\nof\ndemand velocity of demand means this if\nmy price changes by\n1% by what percentage does\nmy sales\nchange well if my price goes down I\nwould expect my demand to go up but by\nhow much now there are certain\nassumptions to this for example it's\nit's assumed that the same number works\nif it increase price as well as your\ndecrease\nprice so this is called the elasticity\nof demand so therefore to get the\nelasticity of demand but what is the\nelocity of demand the elocity of demand\nis essentially a\nslope a slope that relates something\nlike this that if I have Demand on this\nside let's say sales on this side and\nprice on this side I have this negative\nslope the slope of this is what the\nelasticity\nis so very often you do equations like\nthese in order to Simply get at a number\nthat has a certain meaning for\nyou so the slope of linear regression\nbetween log sales and log\nprice is the elasticity of demand for\nthat product I mentioned log sales and\nlo log price because elasticity is done\nin terms of\npercentages a percentage increase in\nprice and a percentage decrease in sales\nif I don't do it as a percentage there's\na problem now my measure depends on my\nunits is it, units per rupee or what it\ndepends on what I'm selling and want\ncurrency and that's not a good measure\nso I measure it not I measure it as\npercentages but when I measure it as\npercentages have to meas on the log\nscale so there are many models like this\nwhere the equation itself is used to\nSimply describe a\nparameter something that tells you a\nlittle bit about the market like an\nelasticity of\ndemand you're not using it to predict\nanything you're simply using it as a\ndescriptor so you say that this is this\nis an inelastic product if this is an\ninelastic product what does that mean it\nmeans that if you change its price there\nwon't be too much of a change in its\ndemand classic examples of that for\nexample are\nsalt if you change the price of salt a\nlittle bit they at least certainly\ndomestic salt there won't be too much of\na change in demand there might be a\nlittle bit but there are certain things\nthat highly in elastic you change it a\nlittle bit and the demand will change a\nlot and marketing people are very\nsensitive to to this idea saying that do\nI is my is my demand elastic or is it in\nelastic if I want my prices to go up\nthen I want the demand to be in elastic\nbecause I don't want my demand to go\ndown if I want my demand to if I want my\nprices to go down or if I'm pulling my\nprices down then I want the demand to be\nelastic because I want people to say\nthat your prices are going down\ntherefore I will buy\nmore so marketing analytics is very\nconcerned with things like\nthis\nso therefore sometimes an equation of\nthis kind is built just to describe\nsomething right so what I'm going to do\nis let's go\ndown and since we are going to do this\njust on two let's pick it just on two so\nlet's let's change this to maybe miles\nand let me remove\nthis so what I'm going to do is I'm just\ngoing to do it\non one of them I I suspect one\nparenthesis might then\nwork I suspect this might\nwork two x has to mean two simply\nbecause of the weight\nentered ah because it because I have not\ndone anything on this data set\nnow this one is a\ncomment so what do I have on the\ncoefficient here 36 and 22 so what is my\nequation based on\nthis miles is equal\nto -\n22 plus\n36.2 n whatever into\nusage okay all right now let's try to do\nthis manually if you want to if I want\nto do this manually what so I need to\nget at each of these things so now I\nneed to find for example I need to find\nlet's say the co variance between miles\nand usage how do I do that tell\nme no not a sample the data is present\nin me so if I so now I have things like\nfor example my data\nmiles correct so I can I can calculate\nthings on this\nso for example I can\ndo I can do\nthis this the mean I can do calculations\non\nthis\nokay so now if I do\nsay say what is the standard deviation\nsyntax\nSt not\nDV\nokay this is standard\ndeviation okay let's try one\nmore this is the variance what is the\nvariance the square of the standard\ndeviation\nnow I want to find the covariance of\nthese how will I find the\ncovariance not necessary remember I have\nthe correlation function how did I find\nthe correlation function\nhere I found a correlation function from\nhere so I've got a number of ways to\npotentially do this one is I can do it\nwith the correlation function or the\ncovariance function in other words so\nfor example I can try doing this how do\nI write it\nhere my data\ndot this thing here was the\ncorrelation this gives the covariance\nMatrix this gives the co Ian Matrix okay\nnow what is the value what is the value\nof B according to my\nformula so covariance of which variables\nnow which are which are my two\nvariables miles and usage where is that\nco-variance is it this number 42.6 71\nright okay divided by\nwhat variance of\nwhat VAR no variance of\nusage\nwhy not why is in why but why is in\nquestion mark why so\nso so my\ndata\ndot\nusage Dot\nbar is this also here in the\ndata it is because what is a sort of\nwhat is the diagonal element of this\nwhat is this\nnumber usage\ndot this is\nusage 1.17 this number here here this\nnumber here is\nthe variance okay what is the equation\nusage this is my\nX this is my y this is my X so\ncovariance of XY divided by the variance\nof X So based on this what is my\nanswer my answer is going to be for the\nthe answer for my coefficient is going\nto be where is the covariance here 42. I\ncan do it you know manually almost 42.\n71 divided by where is the\nvariance\n1 1 7 say you\nknow you know six or something of that\nsort\n36. 318 where is my value of\nB\nhere this is my\nslope\nright how do I get my how do I get my\nintercept mean of\nY\nso my data\nthis is the mean of all of\nthem so what do I want which mean do I\nwant mean\nof what is my y here miles where is my\nmean miles let's say\n103 say point oh I don't know\nsay9 minus what is my slope say 36\npoint I know 32 or something of that\nsort\nstar what is my\nX usage which is 3 point say 4\nfive so\n3.4\n5\n3.3 4\nfive or something like that right will\nstar work that way\nminus\n22 what is my\ncoefficient minus\n22 so if you want to you can do this\nfrom first\nprinciples by using that\nformula I'm not asking you\nto you can do it just by running linear\nregression but what it is is this you\ncan also check the units what is the\nunit of B\nthe unit of B is a unit of Miles divided\nby the unit of usage what is unit of the\ncovariance miles into usage divided by\nvariance which is miles into miles so\nthe ratio of this is usage by\nMiles what is the unit of a\nmiles this is in Miles this is in miles\nper usage and this is in usage so the\nunit all makes\nsense which one\nunits what is the unit of the covariance\nthe unit of X into the unit of Y why is\nthat remember the definition of\ncovariance it's the product of an X and\nA\nY so this is in the unit of the product\nof X and Y this is in the unit of the\nsquare of\nX so the product of X and Y divided by\nthe square of X X and Y cancel out y\nthis becomes the units of Y by X which\nis what B should be B should be in miles\nper usage\n36 means what it is\n36 miles per usage unit that's what B\nis B is in some units because B is in\nsome units we will run into some\ndifficulty when you use this in\npredictive models because let's suppose\nI want to figure out is this number\nequal to zero or not because if this\nnumber is equal to zero statistically\nspeaking then miles doesn't depend on\nusage but because this is not a\ndimensionless number\nI can make it anything I want to by\nsimply changing the unit that makes the\nstatistics a little hard so I cannot\nsimply look at this number and say\nwhether it's high or low I can make your\nheight anything I want to by simply\nchanging the\nscale I can make your height A Million\nby see simply using a small enough unit\nso simply taking a raw measurement tells\nyou no idea of the value of its\nmagnitude yes that same arent will work\nfor any of those parameters so therefore\nwhen we do testing when we do hypothesis\ntesting we need to normalize all these\nnumbers by something and that's\nsomething is typically standard\ndeviation so we'll do that okay so let's\nend this the purpose of this was just to\ntell you what that regression line is\nand then there are similar formulas as\nthe dimensions increases it's hard to do\nthis manually for two of them you can do\nit manually for three of them it's hard\nto show manually which is why I changed\nit because I would not have been able to\ndo this for two way variables the\nformula becomes a lot more complicated\nfor two\nvariables and which is why people don't\nuse the formula for say 10\nvariables now what I want to do is I\nwant to talk a little bit about\nprobability this the slide deck should\nalso be there with you so you have to\ncope with the idea of probability is to\nbe able to cope with this uncertainty\nwhat is the uncertainty that we're\ntalking about here the uncertainty is\nthat is that when you observe OB erve\nsomething you're not entirely sure what\nthe value is not because of a\nmeasurement perspective but because you\ndo not know what the corresponding\npopulation number is you do not know the\ntruth of the number another sample will\ngive you another number there is\nuncertainty and this uncertainty is\nbeing me is usually captured by a\nprobability H here is interesting\nquestion what is the probability that a\nman lives for a thousand years the\nempirical probability what is empirical\nprobability mean empirical probability\nmeans you ask a question has anyone live\nfor a th years if the answer is is no\nthen You' say that the answer is zero if\nanyone has lived for a th000 years you'd\nsay tell me how many people have Liv for\na th years so one interpretation of\nprobability is\nsimply you see it there's a criticism to\nthis point of view of one of our\nteachers Professor dbas who many years\nago would say that if you want to find\nthe probability that little girl is\ngoing to fall into the river how many\nlittle girls do you want to walk next to\nthe river to find\nout so in other words not all\nprobabilities can be thought of as let\nme just see how often it\nhappened so you need a little bit more\nthan\nthis so some words the words are often\nuseful to know probability refers to the\nchance or likelihood of a particular\nevent taking place an event is an\noutcome of an experiment an experiment\nis a process that is performed to\nunderstand and observe probable outcome\nprobable outcomes the set of all\noutcomes of an experiment is called a\nsample space this is correct and it's\neasy to understand with one\nproblem who is performing this\nexperiment now when you use\nprobability you are some you're in\nyou're in two modes in one mode you are\nperforming the experiment what does that\nmean let's say you are running a\nmarketing campaign or you are designing\na portfolio or you are manufacturing a\nproduct or you are recruiting people or\nyou are testing a piece of code you are\ndoing the experiment and sometimes you\nare not doing the experiment somebody\nelse is doing the experiment and you're\nsimply observing the customer is buying\nor is not\nbuying the product is failing in the\nfield or it is not failing the portfolio\nis making money or it is not making\nmoney the person you've hired is staying\non or is\nquitting it is not your experiment you\nare simply observing the outcome of\nit so sometimes you get to do the\nexperiment and sometimes you do not\nwe used to call these things\nexperimental studies and observational\nstudies and experimental studies is\nsomething in which you begin by\ndesigning the experiment and you have a\nhandle over how much data you will\ncollect an observational study is you\njust watch and you see what data comes\nin you will in your careers mostly be\nworking with observational studies\nbecause of the nature of data today\nthere's just a lot more that is simply\nbeing generated without any anyone\nasking for it in certain very peculiar\nsituations you do experimental studies\nfor example nuclear explosions right why\nwhy do countries want to test nuclear\ndevices collect primarily to collect\ndata primarily to figure out whether\nthis thing works or not or how does it\nwork or not so they do little experiment\nto say boom let's see what happened\nbecause otherwise it's all computer\nsimulations and you got no idea whether\nthis happens or not\nI remember running into trouble with my\nengineering friends on this working on\nthe design of a of a fairly large um\naircraft\nengine U and and there was a question of\nsaying that you know what is the thrust\nor what is the efficiency of the engine\nand I and I stupidly made the\nobservation that why don't we test it\nout and so they looked at me this side\nthat side Etc as if you know how how do\nwe going to explain to this\nidiot and then patiently one of them\nsaid to me\nuh very kindly he was a very ctly\ngentleman older than me and he and he\ntook the responsibility of telling me\nwhere will it\ngo so his point was that if this engine\nfires\nup it's going to want to\nmove where will it\ngo pointing to the difficulty that I\ncannot easily do\na full-blown test of a jet engine\nbecause if I do start it I've got to\ngive it enough room to move\nsomewhere so where do you want it to go\nso where do you want it to go so you\nwill not be in a situation to do that\nvery\noften so when you say\nexperiment it is sometimes your\nexperiment and sometimes it is not in\nrare situations will you be in an\nexperimental s like in AB testing and\nwebsites for example it's a common job\nmarketing people often asked to design\nwebsites and they asked to say does\nwhich is a good website so you do an AB\ntest what's an AB test you design a\nwebsite of say type A or type B maybe\none is the old website and you let them\nloose and you find out how people react\nto the different websites this is a\nlittle tricky but I want you to think\nabout this we will not spend a lot of\ntime on it in manufacturing unit three\nparts of an assembly are selected we are\nobserving whether they're defective or\nnot defective determine the sample space\nand the event of getting at least two\ndefective Parts um what is the question\nthat I'm asking the question that I'm\nasking asking is here's a situation\nthere are three\n[Music]\nparts for these three parts I'm\ninterested in knowing whether they're\ngood or\nbad the question is asking this describe\nfor me all the\npossibilities which is what the sample\nspace is so what are the\npossibilities don't talk about\nprobabilities now just talk about the\npossibilities of what could happen we'll\ntalk about the probabilities later all\nthree could be good all three be okay so\nall three could be one way of doing it\nis this all three are defective two of\nthem are defective one of them is\ndefective and none of them are defective\nif you do it this way the sample space\nhas four objects in\nit correct that is one way of describing\nit one\nminus we haven't yet gotten to\nprobability but yes if you get to it you\nknow it'll it'll be one minus that\nand the event of getting at least two\ndefective parts\nmeans two defective or three defective\nthree defective which is good so this is\na this is this is one way of describing\nthe sample\nspace this is not the way the sample\nspace is typically described you're not\nwrong but there's a\nproblem and the problem is this so let's\nsuppose I describe it this way in other\nwords now I describe my sample\nspace as let's say zero\ndefective one defective two defective\nand three defective let's say these are\nmy\npossibilities if I do it this way and\nthis two defective thing is here now if\nI do it this way I will eventually have\nto get around to calculating\nprobabilities and let's say I want to\ncalculate the probability of let's say\nthis event at least two defectives now\nhow will I do that\ncalculation now what happens is the way\nthe probability calculations are done is\nthat you you try to split this up and\nsay that I'm going to find the\nprobability as the sum of individual\noutcomes as the sum of individual events\nI'm going to split it into individual\ncomponents and then add it\nup so therefore I will ask for you\ntherefore what is the probability of two\ndefect and what is the probability of\nthree\ndefect and what is the probability for\nexample of two defects\nso let's say I want to find now what is\nthe chance of two defects how will I\nfind\nthat how will I find the probability of\nthere being two defects in this\nsituation yes and how will I how will I\nhow will I do that\ncalculation 1 and 2\nand there is no see there is you have\nnot allowed me to even think think in\nterms of 1 2 and three there is no 1 2\nand three there's only zero defective\none defective two defective or three\ndefective your sample space has lost all\nidentity as to which one is\ndefective so do you want to revise your\nopinion of what the sample space\nis what do you want to Define it now\nas ah correct so what you can do is you\ncan Define your sample space not in\nterms of the count of defectives but in\nin terms of whether each individual item\nis actually defective or not correct in\nother words what you're doing is you're\nessentially saying let's say good bad or\ngood defective or G what does this mean\nthe first is good the second is\ndefective and the third is good if you\ndo it this way how many elements are\nthere in the sample\nspace eight because each of these can be\ngood\nor good or bad these are your eight\npossibilities\nnow from this what can happen is using\nthese events you can now add them up now\nwhat happens is if I'm looking at let's\nsay two\ndefectives which ones are\nrelevant say this one is this has two\ndefectives this has two defectives\nand so three of them have two defectives\nin it correct one of them has no\ndefectives three of them have one\ndefective three of them have two\ndefectives and one of them has all\ndefectives so this is another way of\nwriting the sample space what this will\ndo is this will allow the calculation to\nbe a little\neasier and your objective is to be able\nto make the calculation a little\neasier so in this particular case for\nexample just just to get the calculation\nout of the way let's suppose that the\nchance of a\ndefective let's suppose the probability\nof a single\ndefect let's say is\n20% let's say\n20% there's a one in five chance that my\nunit is this seems too high you won't\nsurvive let's say\n10% one in 10 is defective\none in 10 is\ndefective if one in 10 is\ndefective the probability is now\n10% then what are the chances of all of\nthese I'm asking for a common sense\nanswer to the question we'll get to the\nconcept A little later one would be\ndefective so the chance you understand\nthe chance that a single one of them is\ndefective is\n10% the chance that a single one of them\nis defective is\n10% and let's say that I want to solve\nthis\nproblem what is the problem the event of\ngetting at least two defective Parts in\nother words I want to find probability\nof let's say two\ndefectives what is\nthis let's work it out it's a good\nexample to work out we we'll understand\nmany things as we do\nit the chance of a single\ndefect is\n10% I'm asking for the chance that I've\ndrawn three of them and that I will see\ntwo things two of them being two\ndefectives this needs a little bit of\nwork let's do this\npatiently let's let's work this out\nright now the chance of two\ndefectives can happen in how many ways\nwe just saw it right\nnow let's suppose that I want to\ncalculate the chance of three\ndefectives to calculate the chance of\nthree defectives here is what I claim I\ncan do I can add up the chance of these\nthree right equivalently I can do it\nthis way probability of two defectives\nis equal to probability\nof\ngbb or b g d or DD G is this\ncorrect there are only three ways in\nwhich I can\nget two\ndefectives you're okay with this\nokay now I'm going to do something\nreally interesting I'm going to write\nthis as P of g d d plus P of d g d plus\nP of\nddg now let me explain what allows me to\ndo\nthis what allows me to do this is the\nfact that if this\nhappens these two cannot\nhappen they are mutually\ndisjoint both cannot\nhappen together which means that if I\ndraw a picture they're like\nthis so if I want to find the chance of\nbeing here or here or\nhere I can simply add up the chance of\nbeing here plus the chance of being here\nplus the chance of being here why can I\ndo that because they're disjoint there\nis no common\nthing if this happens then this does not\nhappen these are two separate\nthings\ndisjoint okay now let's look at each of\nthis probability of g d and D this is\nwhat event the first is good the second\nis defective and the third is defective\nI'm going to write this as P of G\nmultiplied by P of D multiplied by P\nof D I'm going to\nmultiply I want yes I want yes because I\nwant to use a technical term here and\nthe technical term that I want to hear\nis independent\nindependent\nmeans that the whether the first is good\nor\nbad tells me nothing about whether the\nsecond is good or\nbad they are independently good or bad\nthis is an\nassumption but I think the problem\nallows me to make that assumption I'm\nmaking a part it's good or bad I'm\nmaking another part good or bad and\nthese are independent of each other I'm\ntrying to sell a product to him and to\nhim whether he buys or not is\nindependent of whether he buys or not\nthat's an assumption it may be true\nlet's say they're from two different\nneighborhoods or maybe if they're\nneighbors and I'm going from one house\nto the other maybe it is not\nindependent maybe if he buys he's more\ninclined to buy so Independence is an\nassumption in this case I'm making that\nassumption when events are independent I\ncan multiply the\nprobabilities what does that mean for\nexample let's say that he will buy a\nproduct for me let's say 10% of the time\nin other words for every 10 people I\nwant to sell my product to only one\nperson Buys so there's a 10% chance that\nhe will buy my product and let's say\nthere's an independent 10% chance that\nhe will buy my product what is the\nchance that they will both buy my\nproduct 10% multiply it by another 10%\nso first he has to buy that's a 10% and\nthen his 10% will be like 10% of that so\n10% to 10% there's only a 1% chance that\nthey will both by my\nproduct multiplication is allowed when\nthings are\nindependent so Independence means that\nthe probability of both of them\nhappening or let me re let me rephrase\nthe question in this way let me write it\nas one more step let me write this as\nprobability\nof G and D and D I'm going to write this\ng d DS as G and D and D which means the\nfirst is good and the second is bad and\nthe third is bad this and I will now\nwrite as g into D\nsorry into probability of\nD in other words if there's an\nand then I can\nmultiply when if things are independent\nthese laws will be clearly written later\nso if things are\nindependent I can multiply if there is\nan\nand if things are\ndisjoint then I can add when there is a\nor common sense\nrules but they require a little bit of\nsort of logic in\ncalculating so I'm going going to take\nthis on take this to the top now this is\ngoing to be what this is going to equal\np of g into P of D into P of\nD\nplus P of D into P of g into P of D plus\nP of D into P of D into P of G now what\nis p of\nG .9\n90% .9 into\n.9 into\nplus uh very right clever\nthinking into\nthree ah you guys are ahead of me here 3\ninto .9 into .1 into\n.1 even more generally let me even let\nme be even smarter than you\nare I'm going to write this as 3 choose\none\ninto 1 to the power\n2\ninto .9 to the^\n1 it's a sightly sophisticated we have\nwriting the same\nthing\ncorrect why did I write it as three\nchoose\none because why was it\nthree how many\nways could there have\nbeen two defectives out of\nthree so correctly speaking I should\nactually have written this as three\nchoose one or three choose two because\neither I can choose it as one good or I\ncan say it is too\nbad so three choose two is the same as\nthree choose one whichever way you want\nto write it so maybe a slightly better\nway to do it would be to say this is T\nchoose two what are these two the two\nbad defectives out of\nthree what is this 0.1 the chance of a\none defective what is this two there\nwere two of them what is this 0.9 the\nchance of the good\nright so how many Goods how many bads\nwere there two how many goods were there\none in how many ways could I have chosen\ntwo bads out of\nthree three of\nthem right this is the\nanswer this is an example of a\ndistribution called the binomial\ndistribution which we'll\nsee and this calculation you don't need\nto calculate your python will will do\nfor you like all good\nthings right look and feel for many of\nthese classes see it once understand it\nand then you know ignore it huh because\nsomeone else can do the calculation for\nyou we'll do it not to worry we'll get\nto it after the but what is the\nanswer 3 into say1 into .1 into .9\nsomebody tell me what that is I've got\nno\nidea 2 point 4\n2.43\n2.43% 0.02 43 this\nnumber someone verify on\nthere\n0.027 okay and about 2% 2.7% or a little\nover 2% that is the chance of seeing two\ndefects when there is a when the chance\nof seeing a single defect was\nyes so now this is as you can see this\ncalculation is not about defects or\nanything of that sort this is just a\ncounting\nargument this is just a counting\nargument so for example I could have\nasked the question um that I'm I'm\ntrying to sell a product to three\npeople my chances of success is uh is uh\nI don't know um 10% what's the chance\nthat I'll be able to sell to two of\nthem\ntoday I'm going I'm a\nsalesperson I know I can call upon I'm\ngoing to three houses\ntoday let's say that I sell children's\nbooks I've gone to schools I've set up\nmy stall Duan and there I've got three\naddresses of parents who have been kind\nenough to say please come to my home and\nyou know I'm willing to listen to you so\nnow I have on my on my cell phone three\naddresses I'm going to go to today I I\nknow that my chances of selling this are\nnot good optimistically even 10% which\nmeans that if I try to sell to 10 people\nonly one will probably buy so my chances\nof success for a single person is about\n10% so now I can ask myself what is\ngoing to happen at the end of today how\nmany will I sell what is the chance that\nnobody will buy what is the chance that\none person will buy what is the chance\nthat two of them will buy and what what\nis the chance that all three of them\nwill buy so what is the chance that two\nof them will buy 2\n2.7% there's only about a 2 and a half%\nor roughly 2 to 3% chance that I'll end\nup with two of my of these people buy\nnot no I for me I Define 10% as\nbuying so which is I'm I'm saying that\nthis calculation doesn't depend upon\nwhether is defective whether is buying\nanything what it depends on is the\nprobability of an event and you're\nasking the question how many times will\nthis happen and that can be a defective\npart that can be a sale that can be the\nloss of value of of a portfolio that can\nbe the attrition of a of a person that\ncan be a hit on a website that can be a\nclickthrough rate it can be a very small\nnumber for those of you who are in\ndigital marketing what's a typical CTR\nwhat's a typical click-through\nrate any of you with that\nindustry so what's a typical\nclickthrough rate for for\nyou website\nclicks huh email clicks but what's a\nclick through rate so what a click\nthrough rate typically means is of the\npeople who pass through an application\nfor whom the application is an image in\nother words an impression as they say\nwhat percentage of them actually click\non it this is very important for digital\nmarketing you so you're showing ads all\nthese websites come with ads Etc\nsomeone's paying for those ads and they\nwant to know what the click through rate\nis when I see the ad what percentage of\npeople click on the ad and it's\ntypically a very small number have you\never clicked on an ad no most normal\npeople\ndon't but people still advertise people\nstill advertise clickr rates is very\nsmall let's say clickr rate is 3% let's\nsay that means three out of a, people\ncan be expected to click through now I\ncan ask the question for example that if\nI I want to have let's say you know so\nhow many Impressions should I have that\ndepends on how many clicks I expect to\nhave I expect to see so if I want to\nhave let's say 100 people clicking on my\nad that gives me a rough idea as to how\nmany how many I should reach how many\nImpressions I should be I should be\nhaving I can also answer a question like\nthis what is the chance that I will have\nmore or let's say less than 100 people\nclicking so you can ask the question\nwhat is the chance that less than 100\npeople click in a\nmonth how do I calculate that with this\nI can because what I need is I need an\nestimate of how many Impressions there\nare in a\nmonth from that that is shall I say my n\nnow if that is an\nN I can then\ncalculate yes this we\nare\nyes all def I could have if I wanted to\ndo at least\ntwo right if I was solving this question\nat least two then you're absolutely\nright I should have added the last one\nthere's a question of so I've written it\nas this probability of two defectives if\nI did it as at least two you're\nabsolutely right I should have done that\nI could have done that sir how do you\ndefine this impression I'm not an\nimpression is basically the the so on a\nwebsite if you see the ad in other words\nfor a session so someone has gone to\nthat website and that ad is present on\nthat website at that point in time\nthat's an\nimpression if someone has actually\nclicked on that ad in that session\nthat's a click so the click through rate\nessentially is if I'm showing you the\nimpression are you clicking on\nit so I can look at the number of\nImpressions because basically that's\nthat's the number of times that website\nhas been visualized and that ad has been\non it I can also calculate the click\nthrough itate how many people are do are\nlooking at that and now I can ask the\nquestion what is the chance that I have\nless than this so so then what would I\ndo I this number would be let's say the\nnumber\nImpressions this would be say\n100 or and this would be say my click\nthrough\nrate and this would be my 1 minus my\nclick through\nrate so my 03 to the power say 100 those\n100 people who\nclicked the the 19 the the the the 100\nthe number of Impressions minus 100\npeople who did not click and the number\nof ways in which I can get get 100\npeople out of let's say I don't know a\nmillion impressions I do a calculation\nlike that I wouldn't do it I'd get\nsomeone to do it for\nme so this is where we are\nheading now I'm going to slow down a\nlittle bit take you through this\nconceptually just just to get these\nterms understood\nslightly so first of all what is a\nprobability a probability is a number\nbetween 0 and one it is often calculated\nas a ratio the number of ways that is fa\nable divided by the total number of\noutcomes this is not the only way of\ncalculating a probability and it very\nrarely works but it is often a\nconceptually easy way to understand it's\na number between 0 and one zero means\nimpossible one means certain the\nprobability is a pure number it doesn't\nhave\nunits the philosophical question of is\nthe glass half full or half empty types\nof probability different ways of doing\nit now here's what I was talking about\nas mutually exclusive events these are\ntwo things that that have nothing in\ncommon mutually exclusive they exclude\neach other out an example if you're\ndrawing from a deck of cards you can\neither draw a king or you a queen or\nneither of them but if you're drawing\none card you cannot draw both a king and\na\nqueen just like if you're drawing a a\npart it's either defective or it is not\ndefective if you're a physicist you\nwould think of Shing as\ncat hm\nand so physicists have a lot of fun with\nthis you know the story of shing's cat\nright so shinger gave an example of a\ncat saying it's like the position of an\nelectron so there's a cat in a box um\nand this is very unfortunate for the cat\nand there's a vial of\npoison now that vile of poison is a\nlittle unsteady so it could fall down it\ncould break open and if it does then the\nthen the Box fills up with fumes and the\ncat\ndies so you know that there's a box of\nPo there's a vial of poison in the box\nand there's a cat now the question is is\nthe cat dead or\nalive it's a closed box you know that\nthere's poison in the box and there is a\ncat question is is the cat dead or alive\nand the answer\nis you do not know until you open the\nbox now if you open the box you can see\nwhether the cat is alive or\ndead this called collapse of the wave\nfunction in quantum\nphysics which means that the event has\nalready happened but until the wave\nfunction is collapsed you do not know\nwhether the cat is alive or dead if you\ncan observe an electron the electron is\nhere but if you're not observing the\nelectron you don't know where the\nelectron is it could be here or there or\nanywhere so the electron is buzzing\naround the room in physics this is an\nimportant idea and a lot of probability\ntheory has come from physical\nconsiderations if things are mutually\nexclusive you can add of the probability\nas we had said this is king or a queen\nwhat about two independent events two\nindependent events are events such that\nif one of them\nhappens then it no way influences the\noccurrence of the other one in other\nwords if he buys then nothing about it\nif one of them is defective it says\nnothing about the other thing being a\ndefective so let me ask you a question\nnow let me go back to my previous\npicture of mutually disjointed events\nare these two events\nindependent no why are they not\nindependent yes if I know that the king\nis drawn I know something about whether\nthe queen has been drawn or not I know\nin fact that the queen has not been\ndrawn these two are most certainly not\nindependent so please don't confuse\nthese two concepts so you are talking\nabout the next event for the next no I'm\ntalking about the same event I'm talking\nabout King these two events so for\nexample if I talk about let's say one\nparticular one particular unit being G\nor D good or\ndefective if I'm talking about one of\nthem then the picture looks like\nthis it can either be G or it can be D\nit cannot be\nboth this is for one of them but if I am\ntalking about two of\nthem then say this can be G1 and this\ncan be say D2 in other words the chance\nthat the first is good and the second is\ndefective now these two are no longer\ndisjoint why because both these things\ncan happen together it is quite possible\nthat the first is that the first is good\nand the second is defective that's quite\npossible but they're\nindependent independent means if I know\nthat the first is good it tells me\nnothing about whether the second\nis defective or\nnot so if your picture sort of\nintercepts then you know that you cannot\nadd up the\nprobability in fact you know a little\nbit more you know that if you want to\nadd up the probability you can but you\nhave to somehow take out this little\ncommon\npart so dis joint two separate things\nyou add it up it's a\nor this or this not\nboth if such a situation happens you can\nadd the probability up and you can also\nadd\nup\nbut you need to assume Independence we\nwill break all these assumptions soon\nthis is the simplest possible way to do\ncalculations I have to get to a a little\nbit of a nightmare called base theorem\nrule for comput rules for computing\nprobabilities this um language here cup\nand cup cup and cap language there's\nsome set\ntheory um some people find it comfort in\nto see that language others find it\ncomplicating uh it's called the\nunion so Union\nmeans so Union in general means the\ncollection of two things so you know\nthose let's say\nthis this is a and b probability of a\nor\nb\nif there is a common part then\nprobability of\nA or\nB is equal to probability of\na plus probability of B minus\nprobability of A and\nB the chance that both happens is the\nchance that one happens plus the chance\nthat the second happens minus the chance\nthat they both\nhappen if things are\ndisjoint then this becomes zero because\nI know that both cannot happen but in\ngeneral this term stays this is called\nthe\nintersection they both happen\nsimultaneously here's an\nexample what is the probability that the\nselected card is a king or a\nqueen so this assumes that you know what\na card deck is so 52 cards 13 uh four\nsuits so how many Kings Four Kings how\nmany queens Four Queens so what is the\nprobability of a\nking 4 by 52 1 by 30 what is the\nprobability of a queen\n13 what is the probability of a\nking or a queen 1\nby3 plus probability of a\nqueen 2x13 the other way to do it is if\nyou want to how many ways can you get a\nking or a queen eight ways 8 divided by\n52 which is also same\nnumber what about the second one what is\nthe probability that the SL is a king or\na\ndiamond so again there are two ways of\ndoing this P\nof king or\ndiamond is p of king plus P of diamond\nminus P of King and\nDiamond this is let's stay on 52s this\nis so this is 4X 52 1X 13 is also\ncorrect plus probability of diamond 13x\n52\n2 minus King and Diamond there's only\none such card 1 by 52 this\nis 15 by 52 another way of doing it is\nhow many ways can you get a king or a\ndiamond 16 ways the whole suweet of\ndiamonds and there are three remaining\nKings\nor there are 13 k 13 diamonds there are\nfour Kings\nbut I've double counted one of them in\nboth so I should subtract it\nonce second statement\nand um remind me what the second\nstatement was king or a king or diamond\noh the the\nquestion okay you're saying there's a\nking selected card is a king or a\ndiamond\nyouve drawing one card at random from a\ndeck of cards and you're asking is this\na king or a diamond let's say I'm trying\nto I'm trying to sell him something\ncorrect one event that I'm interested in\nis is he going to buy my product or\nnot the other interesting question is\nlet's say for example is he an IT\nprofessional or\nnot correct now is there relationship\nbetween these two\nthings not really but I may be\ninterested in the joint probability of\nthem not because of this event but\nbecause I want to calculate another\nevent that's interesting to me which is\nif I know that he's an IT\nprofessional can I sell him something in\nother\nwords suppose it is not\nindependent suppose I now know that\nwhether he buys my product or not\ndepends on whether he's an IT\nprofessional or something else let's say\nI'm trying to sell him a computer\nperipheral and I may be assuming that if\nhe's an IT professional he may be more\ninterested in a computer peripheral if\nhe's not he may still be interested but\nif he's an IT professional he may be\nmore interested in this particular\nperipheral in that case what I try to do\nis I try to I try to use one unrelated\nevent as information about another one\nin other words I'm saying it is not\nactually\nunrelated so these ands become\ninteresting so effectively how will my\ncalculation go my calculation will go\nthis way say that if I want to find the\nprobability that he will buy my\nproduct given that he's an IT\nprofessional then my answer will be let\nme find the probability that he's both\nwill buy the product and an IT\nprofessional divided by whether he's an\nIT professional why let me first\ncalculate the chance he's an IT\nprofessional within that let me now find\nthe chance that he will buy my\nproduct a given B is equal to a and b\ndivided by\nB this trick this trick is always used\nin analytics to say this and we'll do it\nbefore I've received an email is it spam\nor\nnot which means I need to find tell me\nthe words and I will tell you whether it\nis Spam so now I need to relate the\nwords to\nspam so I have two unrelated Concepts\nbut what I want to do is I want to say\nthat if I know one of them maybe I can\nget some information about the other\nsimilarly here I'm this may be about a\ncolor and this may be about a suit but\nif I know about one of them maybe it\ngives me a little bit of information\nabout the\nother we'll see examples later just\nthinking so what if there was an\nadditional\nquestion or diamond or both it can't be\nboth because I'm drawing one card can be\noh you're asking just about this that's\none\n152 so what of the question was or what\nis challenging is that is this an\nexclusive\nR he's asking is this an XR in computer\nscience in other words he's saying that\nwhen I say or am I excluding the case\nthat both are\nallowed but you a\nsingle no\nthat confusion Still Remains if he's\nvery py so he could say he's making a\ndistinction between two statements king\nor a queen king or a diamond or king or\na diamond or\nboth and need to specify\nboth and in that yes you are\ncorrect needs to be mentioned explicit\nhuh so his mind works in ways in which\nthe default is the\nexclusive your mind works in ways in\nwhich the default is not the exclusive\nbut it's a valid it's a it's a valid\ncriticism to make that that in English\nlanguage when you use it do\nyou which or do you\nmean in when I say this in in\nprobability theory if I say a union B\nand if there is an intersection I\ninclude that\nintersection set theory is not confused\nabout\nthis for set theory a union B is just\nthis set and if there is a common\npart that's in it and in it only\nonce is this\nregion so what I did was we translated\nthis into set theory and he's saying\nthat maybe I should have been a little\nmore careful because there's a\ndifference between this set and the\nfollowing set which is just this part\nand this\npart multiplication rule when things are\nindependent I'm allowed to multiply\nan example there are two subjects the\nchance that you will do well in one of\nthem is 70% the chance that you will do\nwell in the other is 35 is 5% the chance\nthat you will do well in both of them or\na and be the corresponding grades is is\nthe multiplication of the two which is\n35% here comes the interesting part what\nhappens to events which are not\nindependent what happens to\nthe or I'm sorry what happens to the\nmultiplication and there are various\nways in which this two parts written so\nthe currently the way the formula is\nwritten is a and\nb is equal to\ne multiplied by a yes multiplied by\nprobability B given a\nthis is the way this expression is\nwritten sometimes it's easy to\nunderstand this way sometimes it's easy\nto understand this way probability of B\ngiven\na is equal to probability of A and\nB divided by probability of\na I want to know what is the chance that\nb will happen when I've already been\ntold that a will\nhappen so first I find what is the\nchance that a will\nhappen and within that I take the\nfraction of both A and B\nhappening this is the same as saying the\nTop Line A and B is equal to a given B\nthis means what this means A and B is\nfirst a\nhappens then given that a has happened B\nhas\nhappened\ncorrect if a and b are independent what\ndo I know if a and b are independent\nthen A and B is a into B of\nB that means that if a and b are\nindependent\nindependent probability of B given\na no is equal to probability of\nB stare at that for a while if they're\nindependent then this will become P of\nB and so P of B given a will equal p of\nB but is this not exactly what\nIndependence is if I tell you that a has\nhappened I have not changed the chance\nof\nB that is almost by definition what\nIndependence is that by knowing that one\nof them has happened has told me nothing\nabout the second one one by knowing that\nthe first unit was defective told me\nnothing about the second one by knowing\nthat the first customer bought my\nproduct told me nothing about whether\nthe second one will buy it or\nnot so this these statements are\nunderstood in different\nways sometimes this is a good way to\nunderstand it sometimes this is\nsometimes this\nis but this is a more general form for\ndoing it we'll see example of this this\none needs a little bit of work to\nunderstand from a pack of cards two\ncards are drawn in succession one after\nthe other after every draw the selected\ncard is not replaced so you're drawing\none it's like a normal deal the second\none now comes after the first one what\nis the probability that you get both\ndraws you will get\nSpades in other words you'll get two\nSpades two draws two Spades what is what\nis the chance of\nthat so here's a structuring of the\nproblem a is that the you get a spade in\nthe first draw B is you get a spade in\nthe second\ndraw so what is the chance of a the\nchance of a is 13x 52 is the chance of\nthe first one is a\nspade\nnow I want to find a and b and the way I\ndo it is this what is the chance of a\nand then what is the chance of B given a\nin other words I've drawn a\nspade and then what is the chance that I\nwill draw a spade given that I've\nalready drawn a spade the first time and\nthe answer to that\nis minus one because there are now 51\ncards left in the deck and there are 12\nSpades remaining so 12 by 51 so the\nanswer is 13x 52 multiplied by 12 by\n51 now what would the answer have been\nif I had replaced the first\ncard it would have been 13x 52\nmultiplied by 13x 52 because of\nIndependence I put it back right if I\nput it back when I put it back the\nsecond draw looks exactly like the first\none so knowing that I had a sped to\nbegin with has been lost because I've\nalready put that sped back in it is it\nis a situation of independent\nexperiments this one however is the case\nthat the result of the first or the\nresult of the second depends upon the\nresult of the\nfirst but isn't it like we are assuming\nthe second one that we have already\npicked the first one as a spade huh\nbecause that is what is being asked\nfor what is the probability that in both\nthe draws you will get Spades\nso I'm drawing one and I'm drawing a\nsecond one what is the chance that\nthey're both\nSpades here's a here's a here's a\nsimilarish question um what is the\nchance that I will get two adjacent two\nadjacent\nseats on my flight if I don't\npre-book yeah so it's a similar kind of\ncalculation why is it a similar kind of\ncalculation\nsame seat again so you want two adjacent\nseats but for two adjacent seats to be\npicked by you those two there must be\ntwo empty adjacent\nseats now two adjacent empty seats means\nwhat that\nmeans can you calculate that probability\nyes you can but when somebody books\nseats let's say that one particular seat\nhas been booked what happens to the\nprobability of the seat next to it being\nbooked so so the probability of a seat\nbeing booked of a single seat being\nbooked let's say is um making up a\nnumber let's say\n50% a single seat being booked is 50%\nnow I'm telling you that a one\nparticular seat has been booked let's\nsay you know 15a has been booked now I'm\nasking the question given that 15a has\nbeen booked what is the chance that 15b\nwill be\nbooked will it be 50% will be more than\n50% will it be less than 50% it'll be\nmore than\n50% at least if you're modeling\nreasonably well it would be because a\nwhole bunch of people will be booking\npairs we'll be booking pairs so now if I\nknow that one seat has been booked if I\nknow that 15a has been booked now the\nchance that 15b has been booked is going\nto be more than 50% which means that my\nchances of coming late and finding two\nadjacent cat is going to go down because\nI'm looking for cats that are unbooked\nthe chances will be more\nright no the chances will be less\nbecause as people book so people book\nadjacent seats more than at\nrandom so the probability of two adest\nseats being booked is not the product of\nthe individual seats being\nbooked it's more than that so the\nprobability of me finding two empty\nadjacent seats is going to be\nless because I'm looking for empty\nseats so here's an example of doing this\nconditional\ncalculation um marginal probability is a\nterm I'll explain when I do the example\nso here's an example a survey of 200\nfamilies was conducted information\nregarding family income per year and\nwhether the family buys a car given in\nthe following\ntable so the 200 data points 200 surveys\nhave come and they've been distributed\nin a cross tabulation like this we did a\ncross tab like this yesterday as well\nthis is the cross\ntab one access is did they buy a car or\ndid they not buy a car the other is an\nincome statement income below 10 lakhs\nor income greater than 10 lakhs now why\nmight why might I be interested in this\ndata which segment huh to figure out who\nbuy my who buys my\ncars can be sold whether cars can be\nsold and whether that has anything to do\nwith income and if it does have anything\nto do with income then is high better or\nis\nlow better I don't know so what I've\ndone is I've arranged my data in this\nparticular way and now was asking a few\nquestions what is the probability that a\nrandomly selected person or what is the\nprobability someone is a buyer of a car\nit's a it's you don't even need to look\nat the Full\nTable this is 80\nby 200 h probability of let's say car\nthis is called a marginal probability\nwhy marginal because from the picture\nit's at the margin it's at the margin of\nthe table which is where the term\noriginally came from this called a\nmarginal probability there are many\nthings going on but you're asking a\nquestion only about one margin in this\ncase the margin of the car you're not\ninterested in the income this is called\na marginal probability what is the\nprobability that randomly selected\nfamily is both a buyer of a car and\nbelonging to income 10 lakhs or above\nboth buying a car and income 10 lakhs or\nabove 42\non 421 200 okay a family C random is\nfound to be belonging to an income of 10\nlakhs and above what is the probability\nthat the family is a buyer of a\ncar if the income is more than 10 lakhs\nwhat is the chance of a car so this is\nprobability of car given greater\nthan 10\nL 42 by 80 interesting 42 by\n80 why is\nthis you're you you're\nright is\n80 that's a sample\nsize right\nyou understand the logic but that is\nexactly the same as this probability of\ncar and greater than 10\nLHS divided by greater than 10\nlakhs why because car greater than car\nand greater than 10 lakhs is 42 divided\nby 200 and greater than 10 lakhs 80\ndivided by 200 200 200 cancel out this\nagain becomes 42 by 80 but the thinking\nis absolutely right this goes in the\ndenominator because this somehow says\nthat out of how many people am I going\nto\nselect and then on the top is how many\nare both this is called a conditional\nprobability this is called a conditional\nprobability by the way what is this\nnumber this is for example less than 50%\nsorry greater than 50% what is the\nchance of buying a\ncar which is about\n40% that means if I did not know your\nincome I would guess that your chance of\nbuying a car is\n40% if I did know that your income was\nmore than 10 lakhs now your chances of\nbuying a car went up to over\n50% therefore it's worth my while to\nfind out whether your income is more\nthan 10 lakhs\nbecause it at least by the sample data\ntells me that that's going to influence\nin a positive deduction whether you will\nbuy my product or not so I'll try to\nfind\nout this is in terms of words this is\ncalled a marginal probability\nmarginal and this is a\nconditional you might have a a little\nbit of trouble with these words but\nconceptually this is not very\nhard and so this is the calculation that\nwe just\ndid Bas when he originally wrote this\npaper so he talked about it nobody\nunderstood\nhim only after he died did somebody find\nit in his papers and I said okay this is\ngoing to take a long time and then they\nexplained it to others let me explain\nwhat it tries to\ndo yes sir middle one What what is the\nis it or no on the board card car and\ngreater than 10 lakhs it's fine you said\nmarginal probability and this this this\none okay this one is a joint\nprobability this is a\nmarginal this is a joint and this is\na conditional so conditional is a joint\nby a marginal a conditional is a joint\ndivided by a marginal\na\njoint is a marginal multiplied by a\nconditional so the base theorems idea is\nthe\nfollowing what it does is it switches\nwhich event is being conditioned\non it switches between a given B and B\ngiven\na now when would you need to do this\nhere's an\nexample you want to find out whether the\nthe whether the email that you're\nreceiving is Spam do you use\nGmail Gmail often identifies things as\nspam and moves them\nsomewhere how does it do\nthat partly it it looks at the Mals and\nheaders and it uses a very very\ncomplicated algorithm but let's suppose\nyou are building an application of this\nsort and you want to do it based just on\nthe content of the\nemail so you want a following kind of\nprogram you want a program that says\nthat if I know the words of the\nemail I can tell you whether it is Spam\nor\nnot which means I want the following\nthing I want the probability of spam\ngiven words if I tell you the words can\nyou tell me whether this is Spam or\nnot this is what I want to\ndo\ncorrect but how will I solve the problem\nI'll solve the problem by finding the\nopposite conditional\nwhat is the opposite conditional the\nopposite conditional is what is the\nprobability of words\ngiven\nspam now why do am I interested in this\nbecause this one is easier for me to\ndo in the following sense what I can do\nis let's say in my research lab I can\ncollect lots and lots of\ndocuments and I can identify them as\nspam or not spam in other words I can\nmanually go in and I can tag\nthem so let's suppose that I've looked\nat a thousand of these and I've targeted\nlet's say say say 800 of them as spam\nand 200 of them as normal spam or maybe\nI go after things that are spam and find\n5,000 of them and go after things that I\nknow are not spam and find 5,000 of them\nnow I can solve the opposite problem\nwhich means that if I know that it is\nSpam I know the distribution of words\nand if I know that it is not spam I know\nthe distribution of words I can do this\ninside my analytics\nenvironment so now I know that if it is\nSpam this is what the distribution of\nwords looks\nlike if it is not spam this is what the\ndistribution of words look like using\nthat I will now twist the problem and\nsay now if you give me the words I will\ntell you whether it is Spam or not\nnow how do I do that I do that doing\nthis now this is a very easy formula to\nunderstand why because this formula\nessentially says this that why is why is\nthis equality true this equality is true\nbecause let me rewrite it\nslightly let me say what is the\nprobability of let's say\nspam and words\nwhat is the chance of spam and words in\nother words there is an and there now\nI'm going to write this Like A and\nB but here's the interesting thing when\nI wrote I can write a and b in two ways\nI can write it as B multiplied by a\ngiven\nB but I can also write it as e\nmultiplied by B\ngiven I have a choice as to which is\nfirst and which is\nsecond so therefore I can write this in\ntwo ways I can write this as\nspam given\nwords multiplied by\nwords but I can also write it as\nwords given\nspam multiplied by\nspam do you understand the\ntrick but what does that mean that means\nthese two things are\nequal\nno if these two things are equal that\nexpression now follows now I know that\nprobability\nof\nspam given words\nis equal to the probability of words\ngiven spam multiplied by probability of\nspam divided by probability of\nwords so to execute on this what do I\nneed words given spam which I told you\nwhat to do probability of spam which is\nan estimate of the proportion of emails\nthat are spam or not\nspam and probability of\nwords that has no conditioning in it\nthis is what's usually called a\nlexicon or a\ndictionary so if you give me a\ndictionary of the language I can give\nyou this\ndenominator if you give me shall we say\nan IT estimate or a sociological\nestimate as to the proportion of words\nor proportion of emails that end up\nbeing spam I can give you the\nprobability of spam and if you give me\nthings Tagg does spam I can find its\ndictionary distributions if you give me\nthings that are TAG does not spam I can\nfind it so therefore I know the right\nhand side therefore I know the left hand\nside and now if you give me the words I\ncan tell you the probability that it is\nSpam so it's either thought of in the\nway I just described it which is sort of\nflipping these two\nprobabilities sometimes it is described\nthe following way\nspam given words is an update of just\nprobability of\nspam this probability of spam part is\nsometimes in beian language called a\nprior and spam given words is called a\nposterior which means that if I know the\nwords I have a greater idea as to\nwhether it is Spam or not if I know his\nincome if I know he's an IT professional\nI have a better idea whether he'll buy\nthe product or not if if I know the\nincome is more than 10 lakhs I have a\nbetter idea whether he'll buy a car or\nnot if I know the words I have a better\nidea whether it is Spam or not and to do\nthat I flip it this\nway and because of applications like\nthis base theorem has become very very\nCentral to machine\nlearning because for\nexample think of the autonomous car what\nis the autonomous car's decision problem\nsomething is crossing the\nroad should I\nstop in other words given\ncow should I\nstop now think of the think of the the\nproblem that has to be solved to do that\nI can flip it now to flip it means what\nto flip it means essentially flip it by\nsaying cow then stop essentially I now\nhave to tell the program so so I I say\nstop given\ncow so now I to solve it by basum cow\ngiven\nstop so I need to say these are the\nsituations in which a car is stopped and\nthese are the situations in which a car\nhas not stopped so in a stopped\nsituation look at what that car saw and\nin a not stop situation look at what the\ncar\nsaw like spam and not spam and now I can\nflip this and say therefore if this is\nwhat I saw I now know whether to stop or\nor\nnot it's a neat little\nlogic so this is this is what base theum\nessentially does so it will be a\nfoundation to supervis learning right it\nis one way of doing supervised learning\nit is one style of doing supervised\nlearning and there are um there are\nsupervised learning algorithms that are\nexplicitly this for example beian belief\nnetworks but\nBBN there's some supervised learning\nalgorithms that are this but aren't\nexplicit Bally so for example linear\ndiscriminant\nanalysis where what you do is you find\nthe posterior distribution of being in\nthis class given the\ndata and so this class given the data is\nwritten as you know class given\ndata so and vice versa so there are at\nleast two of these algorithms that you\nwill study later distri analysis is one\nand I think BBN I don't know where cul\nbut in general you will find it to be a\nvery useful trick I'll come back and\nI'll show you the the theory behind it\nif you're interested but this is\nactually all\nthat's that needs to be remembered for\nits\napplication so the question is an\nautonomous car his question is why don't\nI do the simple thing of saying that if\nyou see something\nstop now from a for a\ncomputer following that logic the\ncomputer now has to know what should I\ndo when I see something\nnot if I see something and stop so it\ncould say if I see something on the road\nthen\nstop it'll then ask what happens if I\ndon't see something I should keep\ngoing so this becomes a very simple rule\nthat says that if I see something stop\nif I if I sort of don't see anything\nstop now what will this do to the car it\nwon't stop in a signal so so this is a\ntranslation of a rule the difficulty\nwill be the following and you can try\ndoing it the difficulty will be that\nwhat precisely will the car see and it\nwill follow that logic explicitly so if\nit sees a car that is coming quite far\nahead it will stop you could say I'm\ngoing to draw\nthreshold if it is further away from\nthis in front the car in front then\ndon't stop because you're expected to\nsee a car in front and so if you're\nseeing a car in front please don't stop\nbecause something is in front but you\nnow have to encode\nthat and so that way of doing things is\nentirely feasible so for example there's\na there's a whole branch of learning\ncalled case-based\nreasoning case-based reasoning and\ncase-based reasoning essentially lies on\nthat give me all the cases and give me\nthe reasonings for all those\ncases but case-based reasoning sometimes\nbecomes difficult if it becomes very\nvery difficult to enumerate all the\npossible\ncases for example example in the spam\nproblem I have to solve this problem for\nevery conceivable\nword that the email might\nsee because email is going to decide\nbased on the\nwords and if you do if you do do a full\ncase-based approach if the email sees a\nword that it has not seen before the\nemail will say what do you want me to\ndo so typically when ban methods are\nused when it sees that word it'll do\nprecisely nothing in other words it'll\nsay if if certain words are there I will\nupdate my decision if those words are\nnot there I won't it's irrelevant to it\nthere's no evidence that it\nhas so the other is a probabilistic way\nof thinking that base theorem or any of\nthese related and this is probabilistic\nlearning that when you do some when you\nwhen a when an autonomous system or any\nmachine Learning System\ndecides then what does it decide on so\nyou'll often find in data sets the\nfollowing situation I I should have had\nan example I pull it up all the X's are\nthe same but the Y's are\ndifferent all the X's are the Same by\nthe wise are\ndifferent two people have exactly the\nsame characteristics but one has bought\nthe product and one has not bought the\nproduct two people applying for a loan\nhave given you the same information they\ncome from the same Village they have the\nsame income they have the same you know\nfamily circumstances they grow the same\ncrops one farmer has replayed the loan\nthe other farmer has\nnot H car being tested out there's\nsomeone crossing the road identical\nscene one test driver decide to stop the\nother test driver decided not to stop\nsame X different Y what should the\ncomputer\ndo now think of this from a computer's\nperspective what is the computer's\nproblem the computer's problem is if you\ngive me an X I will give you a\ny now what do you want the computer to\ndo in this particular situation because\nin your real data the same X is leading\nto different Ys what's an ideal solution\nhere what would you do how would you\nthink through this\nproblem one possibility is to give it a\nprobability that's one approach to the\nproblem what that means is this that in\nyour data set let's say half your people\nwho have seen this X have given a y of\nzero and half your people who have seen\nthis data set have given it a y of one\nthe computer literally tosses a coin and\ndecides which one to\npredict that's called a randomized\nresponse and sometimes it's done but\nthat could be a disaster as well I'm\nsorry that could become a disaster as\nwell it could but what would what give\nme another\nalternative safest alternative we could\ngo for right which is safe how does a\ncomputer know that what condition is\ngiving the same X its input is\nidentical but action what are the\nconsequence of this action stop anything\nhappen see that consequence has already\nbeen worked out by in\nnature in nature if that consequence was\nthere that would have already have been\nbaked\nin so if there is a consequence to it\nand if there was a good consequence and\nthe test driver would have stopped in\nall cases the cas driver would have\nstopped no the action of stopping of\nstopping going yes take that and\ndiscretion which is more fatal going is\nalways fatal stopping is fatal that that\nthat decision would have been made by\nthe test driver as well would it not\nhave\nbeen the raw data would also have shown\nthat\nbias or are you teaching a computer to\nhave a sense of value that the real\nhuman did not\nhave two doctors look at the identical\nmedical report one doctor says cancer\nthe other doctor says no\ncancer you are building an AI system for\nmedicine what should it\nsay go for another test go for another\ntest\nokay always you should see that you\nshould see a very nice video uh of\nWatson you know what Watson is you\nshould see the Watson videos if you\nhaven't seen it and you want to be a\nAIML professional or an ml professional\nthen you should see the Watson\nvideos wonderful videos and you can see\nyou can see the the decisions at at the\nbottom you can see the um you can see\nhow Watson\ndecides you know what whatson this is\nthe Jeopardy videos so whatson playing\nJeopardy and so some Jeopardy is a quiz\nquestion in which basically the answer\nis given and you have to sort of say the\nquestion or something of that sort so\nwhen you see the video you'll see at the\nbottom you'll see a bar and that bar is\nbasically a set of probability\nstatements as to How likely is this the\nanswer etc\netc and based on those probabilities\nWatson gives an answer and sometimes\nWatson does not give an answer because\nit is unsure of even its best\nanswer so you should so when you watch\nit watch the watch the bottom of the\nscreen the data that Watson is answering\nbased\non this particular we have doing\nbut in general this problem is a hard\nproblem in machine learning because in\nthe real world you will have this issue\nif this was not the case if it was the\ncase that that identical values of X\ngive identical values of Y the machine\nlearning problem would be a mathematical\nfunction fitting problem it would be a\nproblem of simply saying if this is the\nx match map it to the Y just find the\nrule that Maps it to the Y it's not and\nthe reason is not is because identical\ninputs do not lead to identical\noutputs and resolution of that has many\nmany um procedures and possibilities for\ndoing that one of them is a\nprobabilistic way of doing things to\nanswer the following question I will not\ntell you whether Y is zero or one I will\ntell you what is the probability that Y\nis\none I will not tell you whether you have\ncancer or not I will tell you what is\nthe probability that you have\ncancer I will not tell you what the\nprobability of hitting something will be\nif I continue not answer it's not a\ndefinite answer I'm asking for a zero or\na one and I'm not giving you a zero or a\none I'm giving you a\nprobability so at every time the car\nwhen it is driving is calculating a\nnumber given the scene what is the\nprobability that I will hit something\ncontinuously based on what it is seeing\nnow you decide based on that probability\nwhether you should stop or not based on\nyou know your risks Etc the the learning\nsystem does not do that the learning\nsystem does not say whether you should\nbe diagnosed with cancer it simply says\nwhat is the chance that you have cancer\nnow you decide based on your logic as\nwhether that's enough for me to State\nwhether you have cancer or not the\nlearning system will not say what is the\nprobability that you have defaulted on\nthat that it will not say whether you\nwill default on your loan or not it will\nsay what is the probability that you\nwill default on the loan now you decide\nhow much risk you will\nbear that's U one solution to the\nproblem it doesn't even try to predict\nthe right\nanswer it simply gives you a\ndistribution on the possible\nanswers now you decide as I said if you\nsee the Jeopardy videos You'll see this\nin\naction you'll see the the data on which\nit does the category is 19 Century\nnovelists what Watson wants to do then\nis preserve the lead not take a big risk\nespecially with Final Jeopardy because\njust like for humans Final Jeopardy is\nhard for Watson now we come to Watson\nwho is brand stoker and the\nwager hello see the full video\n973 total of\n[Applause]\n77,4 I would have thought that\ntechnology like this was years away but\nit's here now I have the bruised\nphenomenal why someone on a terror\nWatson look at\nthat what it's doing is it's given\nprobabilities on the\nanswers H these don't add up to\none these don't add up to one but what\nis the chance that list is the right\nanswer what is the chance shopan is etc\netc this number if it is below this\nthreshold whatson will say pass it won't\nanswer and it's there in the video a few\nnumber of times it doesn't know but it\nsays that if I am more sure than a\ncertain threshold and if I'm uniquely\nsure it will also not answer if multiple\nof these cross\nhere which means both of them are\nprobably right and I don't know which is\nright they both sound correct to me\nagain I might stop so for each question\nwhat will check the what is the\nprobability of the he'll do that every\nquestion based on hearing it so if\nprobability is done by Python language\nor any of machine language thing then\nwhat is that we are here for meaning\nwhat is our role in deciding that deep\nphilosophical questions why are we why\nare we existing at all H why why are we\nhere at all so so yeah yeah yeah so um\nso one one reason you're there is to\nprovide test data to the\nsystem or what's called Ground truth in\nwords you need to give it\nspam and you need to tell it once that\nthis is\nSpam just like he's saying I need to\ntell it to stop I need to say that this\nis a dangerous thing so so human needs\nto initiate that but yes people are\nasking that question a lot that is that\nhuman initiation\nnecessary now the trouble with that is\nthat the the the value system that is\nnecessary to decide that this is a good\nthing or a bad thing is something that\ncomputers do not have and it's extremely\ndifficult to encode that it's a lot\neasier to encode in a computer in some\nway this is good or this is one decision\nthis is one decision and also if you\nwant to encode a cost to it and if I do\nthis this is what cost reinforcement\nlearning does this if you take a wrong\ndecision there's a penalty function that\nhurts the computer in terms of an\nobjective and the computer knows that if\nI want to reduce shall I say that pain\nfactor I should avoid doing this like\nbabies learn that's called reinforcement\nlearning I don't know whether you'll do\nmuch reinforcement learning in this\ncourse or not but you will do that so\nyou you so you so you so you build\nalgorithms of that kind there will come\na time where that will not be\nnecessary for us it is not necessary but\neven we even humans have to come with\nour genetically coded information we\nalso cannot begin from\nscratch we already come coded with this\nthere's a school of thought that says\nthat that's all that there is that this\ninformation is passing along in other\nwords um a hen is an egg's way of making\nanother\negg so an egg wants to make another egg\nright now how does an egg make another\negg through a hen it makes a hen and\nthat hen makes the egg another egg right\nso which means that there is a basic\ninformation content the genus trying to\nsay I need to\nsurvive so there's a sequence of acds\nand G's that has a survival\nInstinct and the only way it can do that\nis to get another organism to create a\ncopy of it viruses do that\nbrilliantly right the big war going on\non planet Earth for a few billion years\nand still continuing it's a deadly War\nit's called no winners and is going to\ncontinue is a war between bacteria and\nviruses nobody\nwins right these two are at each other\nfor donkey ears because they have two\nvery different ways of dealing with\ninformation right a virus is retrovirus\ntype thing a virus is basically just DNA\nwith the protein around it the way it\nreproduces is like certain Birds we\nlearn in mythology that information gets\ninto another organism typically a\nbacteria so a virus forces a bacteria to\nmake another\nvirus and obviously the bacteria doesn't\nlike\nit and so the bacteria over billions of\nyears have figured out how to prevent\ndoing this and viruses have consequently\nadapted and have repeatedly kept kept\ndoing\nthis and so information transference has\na long long history in the real world in\nthe in the in the Computing world the\nchallenge of saying that how do I input\nthe information how do I get the machine\nto learn is something that we are\nrapidly evolving in the reason this this\ncurrent generation is so excited about\nit and I I'm not that old but even in my\ncareer and I've been doing this for I\ndon't know about 25 years or so roughly\nspeaking I've seen three or four waves\nof it you know goes up it goes down it\ngoes up it goes down and different the\ncurrent version of it essentially is\nbased on certain deep learning\nalgorithms that have come and have made\nit a lot easier to feedback\ninformation so you know recurrent neural\nnetworks con all these neural networks\nnow have the ability to feed context and\nfeed information a lot more efficiently\nwhich means this idea that a computer\ncan pick up context and use it to get\nbetter algorithms is\nthere uh and that scares a few people\nmightily because what it means is that\nas a car keeps driving very\nwell it's knowing that it's driving very\nwell and it'll keep doing certain\nthings so so the school of thought that\nsays that therefore maybe the car should\nhave a few\naccidents just\nlike maybe there should be a few nuclear\nexplosions let's suppose that you go and\nget an HIV test\ndone HIV tests are routinely done let\nsay you have surgery or anything like\nthat Etc HIV tests are done so let's\nsuppose that for whatever be the reason\nan HIV test gets done and the test turns\nout to be positive I hope it never\nhappens to you but let's suppose the\ntest turns out to be positive the\nquestion is how scared should you\nbe very that's a reasonable\nanswer but let's work it\nout so to do that trying to calculate\nthe probability\nof\nHIV given positive\ntest this is what I'm interested in\ncalculating because my life may depend\non\nit there are many ways to do this here's\na suggested\nroot now what I'm going to do is I'm\ngoing to write this version of the\nformula\ndown\nH without necessarily and you'll see\nwhat what it means here so what I'm\ngoing to do is this I'm going to write\nthis\nas probability\nof HIV and\nplus divide by probability\nof\npositive\ncorrect conditional is joint divided by\nmarginal now I'm going to write the\nnumerator as probability\nof positive given\nHIV multiplied by probability of\nHIV I'm going to twist it\nit here's\nwhy these are\nnumbers that are much more available to\nme what is this\nnumber this number\nmeans that if I have\nHIV what is the chance that the test\nwill be positive that's called the\nsensitivity of a test a test maker has\nto report\nthat this is the proportion of people\nwho have HIV this is the incidence rate\nit has nothing to do with me it's like\nmy dictionary it's just the fraction of\npeople who have\nHIV so these are numbers that I know one\nfrom epidemiology and one from my test\nmanufacturer divided\nby positive and I'm going to do\nsomething very interesting on the\npositive I'm going to write this\npositive\nin two ways there are two ways in which\nsomeone can become\npositive HIV and\npositive\nplus not\nHIV\nand\npositive okay disjoint there are two\ndisjoint ways in which I can end up\nbeing\npositive either I have the disease or I\ndo not have the\ndisease now I can write this\nas this side already calculated is the\nsame\nnumber probability\nof positive given\nHIV multiplied by probability HIV\nplus probability of positive given not\nHIV multiplied by\nprobability not\nHIV this is this formula just exampled\nout we're going to apply this and see\nwhat\nhappens let's what are the numbers that\nI need I need a number of probability of\nHIV probability of HIV is a incidence\nrate for HIV what's a good number for\nthis\n01 Mo okay let's say .1% that's actually\nvery low the\nHIV rate is a lot higher oh let's say\n1% 1% 1% of people have HIV and\n99% don't what this also means is that\nprobability of not HIV\nis\n99% okay I also need a few other things\nI need for example\nthis probability\nof positive\ngiven HIV this is a measure of how good\nthe test is if you have\nHIV what is the chance that it will\nreport that you have HIV what's a good\nnumber for\nthis\n99%\n95% what does 95% mean that if you have\nHIV there's 95% chance that I will find\nit equivalently for 100 people who have\nHIV for 95 of them I will find\nit yes\ncan which\none I asked this is this will come from\nthe this is called a sensitivity number\nit comes from the test a very good test\nmay have this at 99%\n99.9% a not very good test or a cheap\ntest test may have this at\n90% I'm assuming that this test has 95%\npick your own\nnumber its sensitivity is 90% the other\nnumber is sometimes called specificity\nso for example let's say I go the other\nway positive of negative given not HIV\nwhich means if it if you do not have\nHIV what is the chance that it will say\nyou do not have\nHIV again 95% again 95 in other words\nI'm I I have a fairly simp simp test\nwhich is 95%\naccurate whatever your disease state is\n95% of the time it will give you the\nright\nanswer okay now let me re askk the\nquestion I've given you a test that is\n95%\naccurate I'm now telling you that your\ntest is\npositive what is the chance that you are\nHIV positive 95% that's a reasonable\nguess right let's let's work it\nout negative not HIV is 95% so what is\npositive given not\nHIV\n5% correct okay now I have everything\nthat I need to calculate this what is\npositive given\nHIV 0.95 correct into what is\nprobability\nHIV 01 if he's given it as 1%\n% downstairs again 95 into\n01\nplus what is this positive and not\nHIV 05 multiplied by probability not\nHIV\n99 correct someone please work this\nout on a calculator or\non what is collectively\nexhausted it is depend means together\nthey cover\neverything yes which means in our\nparticular case you have HIV or you do\nnot have HIV there are no other\npossibilities they exclusive why because\neither you have HIV or you do not have\nHIV yeah yeah that is huh but exhaust\nexhaustive events means there are no\nother\nthings so this uh B uh given HIV\npositive is 95 so yes because of that\nthat 95 we are not calculating this\nwhich one the last one 5% this 5% this\nis I think one minus this for not HIV if\nnegative was 95% then positive will be\n5% what is this\nnumber\npoint I have two I have high variance in\nmy\nanswers\nanyone\nelse\n0.16 0.16 there's 16% chance you have\nHIV if you test positive why is it that\na fairly accurate test a 95% accurate\ntest my wife and I have a have a have a\nbiotic company we're trying to release a\nproduct on molecular diagnosis for\ninfectious diseases if we get 95% we'd\nbe thrilled our investors would be\nthrilled we'd be in\nbusiness this is not easy to attain\nparticularly cheap we're trying to keep\nthe cost of our test fairly low for\nthings like UTI and stuff like that\nbut so where is the problem SLE size\nfalse\npositives 95% Pro but there's a there's\na there is a there is a there is a\nproblem of false positives here um so\nanother way of seeing exactly this same\ncalculation or pretty much exactly the\nsame calculation is the following thing\nso I'm going to rub out base theorem\nhere which is exactly this I leave it to\nyou to link this to bi etc etc but\nsometimes it's easy to just understand\nit as an example as how it's done but\nI'll show it to you as I'll now show it\nto you as a picture I leave this here\nand now let's assume that I begin with a\npopulation of maybe 100,000\npeople let's suppose that I've got\n100,000\npeople who are are being tested let's\nsay now of these 100,000 people some of\nthem have the disease some of them do\nnot have the disease some will I don't\nthe total is this is my sample space so\nto speak now let's say how many of them\nhave\nHIV 1% 1% so that's how\nmany, so a thousand of them are here so\nthese are HIV and how many are not\nHIV\n999,000\ncorrect now of these 1,000 how many of\nthem test\npositive\n950 and how many test\nnegative\n50 okay of this 999,000 how many tests\npositive and how many tests\nnegative so these guys should test\nnegative so what is 95% or what is 5% of\n99,500 of\n999,000 4950 is 5% so 5% is a wrong\nwhich means 4 4950 are\nhere this is 5% of 999,000 and so how\nmany are now here\nnegative\n94,000 about\nthat 95,000\nthis number won't matter much anyway so\nyou're okay with the situation here now\nlet's look at all the people who've\ntested positive where are all the people\nwho have tested\npositive these guys have tested positive\nand these guys have tested positive so\nhow many people have tested positive in\nall so\n950 plus 4\n4950 of them how many have the\ndisease 950 calculate\nthis this is exactly the same\ncalculation you did before\narithmetically it is the same\ncalculation 4950 is the cprit\nhere here 4950 is the culprit what does\nthat mean it means that there were a lot\nof people who had a false positive now\nwhy was there are a lot of people who\nhad false positives because there were a\nlot of people who did not have the\ndisease for that large number of people\nwho did not have the disease only a few\npositives will swamp the positives of\nthe people who had the disease which\nmeans most of the people who are testing\npositive are actually healthy\npeople who have had the misfortune of\nthe test going wrong on\nthem but because there were so many of\nthem it affected the\nprobability so if it is an epidemic for\nexample which is not very rare then I\nthink test is no but what is it for you\nso so what is the moral of the story now\nso therefore what will happen let's say\ntherefore let's say you go and let's I'm\npretty sure this hasn't happened but if\nsomebody gets a positive HIV test what\nwill the doctor\nsay check one\nmore get a retest done\nwhy because let's suppose this is my\ntest let's suppose this is my test and\nlet's suppose now I've changed the test\nto saying that I will say you have HIV\nonly if you test positive twice in a row\nyou test it twice and both times you\nwill end up you show up positive now\nwhat happens to these\nnumbers what is now the positive given\nHIV and what is now negative given HIV\nfirst of all what happens to what\nhappens to this what happens to the What\nis the chance of a false positive now so\nthe chance of a false positive which was\npreviously\n5% now become yes now becomes you must\nit must go wrong\ntwice so 05 into\n05 and then one minus that 5% of 5% 5%\nof 5% is what it's a quarter of a\npercent or something like that or even\nless maybe that becomes now a very large\nnumber so this number becomes much\nsmaller the chance of a false positive\nbecomes much lower and because the\nchance of a false positive becomes much\nlower this number becomes a lot lower\nand now the number begins to approximate\nwhat you think it would but for this to\nwork I must be able to multiply the two\nprobabilities that both tests went\nwrong that multiplication comes from\nIndependence which means the second test\nthat you should do should be from a\ndifferent laboratory which would have\nits own biases it'll have its own\nproblems but they'll be independent of\nthe first guy and you can multiply this\nout and this problem will go away if it\ndoesn't multiply\nout this if the same result happens in\nother words if the same thing shows up\nthen this5 will not go\ndown so now this difficulty with based\nrule this also again for example this\nshows up in many things even in even in\nbusiness so if I if I'm trying to detect\nlet's say\nfraud I'm trying to detect fraud and I\nand have a fraud detection I'll go\nand I now say if I see this signal what\nis the chance that it is\nfraud by base theorem that will be\nlow the reason that will be low is\nbecause most transactions are not\nfraudulent\ntransactions and so even if there is a\nsmall possibility of detecting a non-fr\nfraud transaction as a fraud transaction\nI have messed up my\nalgorithm does it mean if we run it\ntwice we give the accur\nyou have to do the test independently\nrunning the same program twice will not\nhelp\nyou huh so in the biological example you\nneed to run it again for in a different\ntest in a in a in a machine learning\nsituation what does that mean it means\nyou have to give it fresh\ndata different data from the same\nsituation shall we say which is a little\nharder but that's fine so this is base\ntheorem sir that last World and spam\nproblem\nhow does it kind of map to this how does\nit map to this okay well it looks it\nlooks completely different does it not\nah okay we'll do it this way what is the\nproportion of spam and not spam let's\nsay this is\nSpam and not\nspam H what is the prop so I need to\nknow this this is the proportion of\nthings that are spam and not spam\nindependent of what is in the text\nwhat's the proportion of emails at our\nspam what do you\nthink 5% huh 30% of\nspam okay you guys know your\ninbox it also points to a healthy social\nlife right so now what now let's suppose\nthat we fix the problem and I'm going to\nsolve the problem not for not for words\nbut for one\nword\nso what's a Spam like word for\nexample\nby congratulation\ncongratulations\nright okay okay P cool congratulation\nH so\nnow so now I want probability of\ncongratulations given\nspam\nwhat is probability of congratulation\ngiven spam if congratulation is\nthere then if it is spam what is the\nchance of the word congratulation will\nbe\nthere 100% that's little to\nhuh\n75% let's say let's say this let's say\nthis is\n75% right then what else do I need\nbecause what is the problem I'm trying\nto\nsolve huh so I'm trying to solve the\nfollowing problem I'm trying to find\nprobability of\nspam given\ncongratulation this is what I want to\nfind I want to say that if I see the\nword congratulation what is the chance\nthat this email is Spam that is the\nproblem I want to solve now to solve\nthat I'm solving the opposite problem\nI'm saying what is spam what is not spam\nwhat is congratulation given spam and I\nneed and I need one more\nprobability\ncongratulations congratulations not\nspam what is\nthis 25% not necessarily one minus this\nthis is a separate calculation but it\ncould be 25% if you want\nto let's make it\n35 h huh which means if it is a genuine\nemail if it's not spam there's 35%\nchance of the word congratulations will\nbe there now I don't need to make this\nup as I said in a laboratory I can look\nat all Spam things and I can count how\nmany times congratulations shows up in\nit so now let's suppose let's suppose\nthis is\nhere let's suppose I know this now can\nyou do the calculation you can do it\nusing base rule you can do it using the\ndrag diagram if you want to just try\nwhat is the\nanswer so what we are saying that\ncongratulations not 35% that is know\nthese four numbers are known to you well\nactually you know these are the same\nnumber so three numbers are known to\nyou if it is Spam then the chance of\ncongratulation is 75% if it is not spam\nthe chance of congratulation is\n35% now I want to find what is the\nprobability of spam given that there is\ncongratulation now how do I how do I of\nfour three are known right all four are\nknown this is my shall we say the\ninformation that's available to\nme some of you can try using the formula\nsome of you can try using the\npicture so if I do it using the\nformula what will it look like spam\ngiven\ncongratulations\nis equal to probability\nof congrats I'm going toize this\nspam multiplied by\nspam divided by probability of\ncongrats given\nspam multiplied by probability of\nspam plus probability\nof congrats given not\nspam multip IED by probability of not\nspam\nthis and this is what congrats given\nspam\nis 75 into probability of spam\nis3 divided by 75 into\n3 plus congrats given not\nspam 35\nmultiplied by not spam is\n7\npoint no is\nit\n47 or you might want to draw a picture\nlike this like we had drawn before begin\nwith another typical number let's say\n100,000 you'll do it as spam not spam on\nthe spam side this is 100,000 emails on\nthe spam side how many will there be\n30,000 on this side\n70,000 on this side how many will have\ncongratulations this is on the stamp\nside 75% of them will have\ncongratulations so 75% off 30,000 that's\nwhat 22,000 500 or something like\nthat and the remaining will not have\ncongratulations how many here will have\ncongratulations um for not\nspam 35% of 70,000 what is 35% of\n70,000\nhuh\n24,500 and so what is my answer\n22,500 divided by 22,500 +\n24,500 which is presumably my\n47% you can do this as\nwell so\nwithout opening the\nemail without opening the email and\nseeing the email the chance that it is\nSpam is\n30% but if the word congratulation is\nthere in the email the chance that it is\nSpam has gone up to\n47% now you would not do this just for\ncongratulations you do this for a whole\nbunch of\nwords which means that instead of\ncongratulations congratulation and\nsomething and something Etc which means\nthat instead of congratulations here\nit'll be congratulations and something\nand something and something here which\nmeans for these probabilities you will\nneed to say congratulation and something\nelse let's say another word what's\nanother\nword offer so you would now say what is\nthe probability of spam given\ncongratulation and offer now you would\nneed congratulation and offer but if you\nassume Independence there this can be\ncongratulations given spam multiplied by\noffer given\nspam so word by word the probability can\nbe calculated and it can be put in this\napproach you'll see studying text mining\none of your courses it's called the bag\nof words\napproach the words that put into a bag\nirrespective of their order and things\nlike\nthat\nyeah for\none\nyes\nyes\neach yes so so each of these the a will\nthen be a new event and that new event\nwould be different\nwords and so that those different words\nwill be thought of as the product of\neach word so the chance that that the\nwords congratulations and offer are\nthere in the\nemail is the chance that congratulation\nis there in the email multiplied by the\nchance that offer is there in the email\nthat's an assumption an assumption that\nis built into the bag of words\nmodel if you don't like it it what you\nhave to do is you have to give me the\njoint probability of offer and words and\nthose models are also there they're\ncalled Byram\nmodels spam and not\nno spam and not spam are where spam and\nnot spam and not spam are in the\nbi right but in the\nformula for each case yes we are adding\ntwo times these two spam and not\nspam\nyes yes so you're relating it relating\nit to two here there were there are key\npossibilities number of possibility will\nbe combination of no the number of\npossibilities in this\ncase no and there could be other\npossibilities here here the things I'm\ndeciding between are just two spam or\nnot spam in this formula the number of\nthings that I'm deciding between are\nmany for example in your Gmail how many\ncategories are there\nthere's social there's promotions and\nprimary so instead of it being spam I\ncan Define it as primary social and\npromotions so now I need to find what is\nthe probability of primary given\ncongratulation promotion given\ncongratulation and social given\ncongratulation there are three of these\nnow that can that now you can apply here\nthere's B1 B2 and B3\nso you we've already seen an example of\na distribution I'll simply tell you what\nit is the binomial distribution what is\nthe binomial distribution the binomial\ndistribution is a distribution of Simply\ncounting the number of things the number\nof defective products H um the number of\ncustomers that receive service etc etc\nexactly like the applications that we\nwere talking about this is the statement\nwe have already\nseen the probability of getting X\nsuccesses out of n\ntrials is p of X is equal to n choose x\np ^ x 1 - p ^ x where the individual p\nis the probability of getting success in\none\ntrial you remember my formula of Point 1\nto the^\n2 so it's that formula\nwhat does this formula say this formula\nsays that if p is the probability of\nsuccess of a single\ntrial then what is the\nprobability of getting X\nsuccesses out of n\ntrials\nn\ntrials p\nis the success\nprobability of each\ntrial what is the probability of X\nsuccesses n choose x p ^ x 1 - p ^ n\nminus X how do I think this\nthrough what is a trial a trial is the\ntotal number of attempts that I'm making\nthe total number of products that I'm\nmaking I'm making three\nproducts the probability of each product\nbeing defective\nis\n0.1 what is the chance that I will get\ntwo\ndefects 3 ches\n2.1 to the^\n2.9 to the^\n1 P successes P into P into\np n\nminus X failures what is not a success\nis a failure whose probability is 1\nminus\np and there are X ways of choosing\nthat original\nn sir in this case it's a like these\ntrials are like with\nreplacement these trials are not just\nwith replacement yes they're with\nreplacement it's not like it's it's a\nit's a population so to speak in other\nwords an actual experiment is not being\ndone um it's imagined that someone is\ndoing this experiment\nrepeatedly so yes if you want to think\nof it as replacement as replacement it's\na model for example here A Bank issues\ncard statements to customers under the\nscheme of MasterCard based on past data\nthe bank has found that 60% of all\naccounts pay on time following the bill\nif a sample of seven accounts is\nselected at random from the current\ndatabase construct the bin probability\ndistribution of accounts paying on time\nwhat is the question being asked the\nquestion being asked is this that I am\nlooking at seven\naccounts and I'm trying to understand\nhow many of those\naccounts are paying\nup how many of those accounts are paying\nup now what values can it\ntake what what are the possible values\nthat that that that my X can take\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 and\nseven six\nmeans none pay on\ntime I'm sorry zero means non pay on\ntime one means one pays on time seven\nmeans all pay on\ntime the chance that every one of them\nindividually pay on time is\n60% and I'm going to make the assumption\nthat these people aren't talking to each\nother so they're behaving independently\nthe 60% chance applies to everyone\nseparately which means that if one\nperson has paid that has had no impact\non whether another person has paid or\nnot correct let's do one of these\ncalculations let's say what is the\nprobability that um\nlet's say um how many\npeople two people pay on\ntime so 2 pay on\ntime what is the answer to\nthis you can use this formula directly\nbut two people pay on time means 6 into\n2 6 into 6 not into 2 to the^\n24 to the^\n5 these are the five people who have not\npaid on time these are the two people\nwho have paid on time so this 6 into 6\ninto this 6 into 6 into point4 into\npoint4 into point4 into point4 into\npoint4 the seven people now that is one\nArrangement how many such arrangements\nare possible seven choose two\narrangements are possible those two\ncould be the first\ntwo they could be the next two they\ncould be the first and the last there\nare seven choose two of those for each\nof them is a pattern paid paid not paid\nnot paid paid and every time you see a\npaid 6 every time you see a not do not\npaid\npoint4 the 6 you're going to see\ntwice and the point four you're going to\nsee five times therefore this\nformula so can you expand choose one 7 7\nchoose two is a Formula which simply\nsays how many ways can I pick two things\nout of seven the formula for it is 7\nfactorial divided 2 factorial into 5\nfactorial H which is 7 in this case 7\ninto\n6 divided by\n2 which is I think 21 21 the 21 ways to\npick two team two out of\nseven because I asked for\ntwo\nI can do it and the problem asked for\nall combinations I've just solved it for\nfor one particular answer I need to do\nit for 0 1 2 3 4 all of\nthem if I add them what answer will I\nget I'll get the answer one because\nsomething must happen isn't the number\nof Trials eight no the number of Trials\nis seven the number of outcomes is\neight if I toss one coin I can see two\nthings so there are seven outcomes there\nare seven\npeople so 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 that's eight\nthe eight possible outcomes all right so\nnow there is a file here um it's called\nI think um binomial distribution example\nYou' You' import a few things for\nplotting and for the stat functions then\nI'm going to set up the problem how am I\ngoing to set up the problem in this\nparticular case just by specifying an n\nand specifying a p\nwhat is the n in this case n is the\ntotal number of Trials why is it seven\nfor me because there are seven customers\ncorrect p is 6 where do I get this 6\nhere right this\n60% what am I doing here what I'm doing\nhere is I'm creating the sample space\nI'm creating the set of numbers for\nwhich I want to calculate the\nprobability\nso this one\nhere the range function 0 to 8 so when I\ndo this it creates an array of eight\nnumbers 0 to seven do that zero really\nhas a value we don't need of course we\ndo there is a there is a reasonable\nprobability that nobody pays on\ntime same\nplace wherever you got the other one\nfrom can you repeat bu for the basis of\nthe formula how it was how it was\nformed this\nis X people have paid so this is p so\nthink of it as P into P into p x\ntimes and think of 1 - P into 1 -\np n - x\n* because X people have paid and what\nallows me to multiply the probabilities\nbecause because if there's 60% chance\nyou pay there's also 60% chance you pay\nand so when I when I figure out the\nchance that both of you pay is going to\nbe 66 into 6 and if he doesn't pay and I\nwant to multiply those 6 into 6 into\npoint4 now how many sixes are there how\nmany successes I want how many point\nfours are there how many non successes\nare there and how many such\npossibilities are there how many ways\ncan I get two successes that is what I'm\ncalling 7 choose two which is 21\nwhy is it 21 you are going to pick two\npeople out of seven how many ways can\nyou pick them the first person you can\npick is 7 Ways the first person who pays\non time the second you can pick in six\nways 7 into six but if I pick U First\nand U second that's the same as picking\nU First and U second so I've double\ncounted so buy two so 7 into 6 by 2\nwhich is my\n21 so uh one quick question\nwhen in Practical world I look out for\nbinom distri this application this kind\nof application or another kind of\napplication for example I can change\nthis to saying uh in sales I am I am\nselling my or I I am approaching seven\nleads the chance of a conversion for a\nlead is 60% what is my sales\ndistribution okay so I'll use that\ninformation for example to to figure out\num let's say that um how much budget\nshould I have for the sales\nteam for example I could say um you know\nwhat I'm going to approach seven leads\nand I'm going to get sales\nhowever how are those sales going to be\nmade those sales are going to the sales\nare going to be made on the phone but to\nconfirm the sale I need to be able to\nsend a sales person to the person's\nhouse and get their\nsignature this person is going to take a\ncertain amount of time to travel through\nthe famous city of\nBangalore and get stuck in the traffic\njam and get there so I'll be able to get\nat most three signatures in a\nday and if I lose it I lose it or four\nsignatures or so let's suppose that\ntherefore I employ one\nperson is that good\nenough so now I'm asking the question\nwhat is the probability that I'll end up\nmaking more than three sales in a\nday because if I end up making more than\nthree sales in a day I'll not be able to\nclose all the\nsales so this becomes a Salesforce\nquestion it becomes a question of saying\nthat based on my ability to sale I\nshould have a sales team if my sales\nteam is too short too small there's a\nprobability that they will not be able\nto close out all my sales and I leave\nmoney on the table if my sales team is\ntoo big I'll be spaying for that sales\nteam but they will not have enough to\ndo so yes the binomial distribution is\nused left right and Center big in\ncontact Cent In in contact centers yes\nit's used same same argument in contact\nCent for example one reason it's used is\nhow many escalations do you\nexpect so in many of these so how do I\nexecute on this so I've given the I've\nI've I've I've created the\narray now here's the command that you\nneed to know this command calculates\nthat\nformula that n choose K that\nformula that formula is\ncalculated right by the way you can\nmanually do this if you want to Once\nwhich is your 21 into 6 ^ 2 into .5 to ^\nfour does anyone want to manually do it\nonce no one has any just to check\notherwise you'll just trust the output\nthat's\nfine but if I do this binomial stats.\nbinomial\npmf pmf stands for probability Mass\nfunction in case you want to know what\nEarth that means huh probability Mass\nfunction so this thing is called\na prob ility\nMass\nfunction probability clear Mass means\nit's almost as if you're thinking of a a\nsolid material and the probability as\nbeing physical Mass how much mass is in\neach number how much mass is in each\nnumber so what\nit this\nnumber the pmf simply is this\nnumber\nit's a calculation of this\nnumber so now if I ask for binomial if\nyou do it without the equal to it'll\njust give it\ndirectly all right so it done it just\ntakes a little bit of\ntime so binomial is an\narray so what is this number\nhere for zero so what is this in the\nbusiness context this is the chance that\nnobody pays on\ntime the number of people who pay on\ntime is\nzero so it's about1 16% number of if\nwhat is the chance that 1% pays on time\n1.7\n1.7% two people pay on time about\n7.7% three people pay on time about\n19% four people pay on time about\n29% five people pay on time time 26% 6\npeople 133% 7 people about\n2.7% okay curiosity question how many\npeople would you expect to pay on\ntime seven no remember there's 60%\nchance that everyone will\npay yes four or five in fact the right\nanswer is 7 into.\n6 which is about 0\n4.2% so you would expect to see about\nfour or a little more than four people\npay on\ntime and the chance of four people\npaying on time is what 0\n1 29% and the chance that five people\npay on time is about 26% if you want to\nplot this there's a there's a slightly\nsort of you know jazzed up version of a\nplot here so the first line says plot\nit you know it says binomial then\nthere's a title\nthere's a labels and then finally the\nplot command itself I think that's a\nplotting artifact I mean it tells you\nwhat to plot you can remove it and see\nwhat happens here's an interesting thing\nsomeone's asked what happens when I add\nup all the\nprobabilities which is what I get\nhere I don't need it it's a check sum so\nso one Poss one possibility of a\nbusiness outcome is what is the\nprobability that say more than six\npeople do not pay their bills on\ntime now in a collection team in a bank\ncertainly is interested in\nthat because you have to go after that\nthere's also a question of what is the\nentitlement on my on my on a specific\nmonth so a bank is going to make money\nor a telephone company whoever is going\nto make money on the amount of Bill\nthat's actually paid now the fact that a\nbill has been given to a person doesn't\nnecessarily mean they'll pay it like\nhere so how much money does the bank\nactually expect to\nmake it has to have an estimate of its\nRevenue per month how does it get that\nby doing a calculation of this kind\nhere's a little formula if it wants to\nhelp you the average of a binomial\ndistribution is given by n into P we\njust discussed that total number of\nTrials into the probability 7\ninto\n6 which means for example that if I\nthink that my success probability of a\nsale is 10% and I approach 10 people the\nnumber of people I expect number of\nsales I expect to make is 10 into .1\nwhich is\n1 does that mean I will make one sell\nno the distribution goes from 0 1 2 3 up\nto 10 but the average is\nat one similarly the average of this\ndistribution is where it's at\n4.2 but where is the picture where is\nthe average where is 4 4.2 somewhere\nhere right somewhere here is 4.2 this is\nthe center gravity of the of the\ndistribution the standard there's a\nstandard deviation formula if you want\nto know NP into 1 minus\nP the standard deviation will make a\nlittle more sense when we talk about the\nnormal distribution I hope I'll get\nthere now there's another distribution\nwhich is used a little less in practice\nyou guys are all very practical types\nhow is it how is it used any examples\nwhy would we use mean or standard\ndeviation the question the kind of\nquestion he asked so I want to make an\nestimate for example as to how many\npeople will pay pay my\nbills because based on that I will\ndecide so I can do it two ways I can for\nexample say what is the number of people\nI expect to pay my bills\n4.2 what is the number of number of\nsales I expect to make what is the\nnumber of Errors I'd expect to have in\nmy\ncode what is the number of defective\nproducts what is the number of expected\ncustomer recalls that I have whichever\nindustry you're in there are events that\nhappen in that industry and you're\ntrying to find out and estimate for it\none estimate for it is an expectation\nlike we discussed yesterday but remember\nthis one is not coming from\ndata 7 into 6 is not a calculation Based\non data I didn't give you any\ndata on people paying their bills on\ntime I give you a theoretical\ndistribution this is an assumption that\nI\nmade H it's not an average computed on\ndata so therefore when I make the\ndistribution assumption and I say based\non that distribution what is the\nexpected number I should see will I see\nthat all the time no that's why there's\na\ndistribution so there was that array\nthat you gave like probability of one\nperson two in reality when you do real\nsolution this this array is something\nwhich we have to chge with the\nhistorical data in the lab right no so\nthis would be used and and it is often\nused where what will come from the what\nwill come from the data one thing that\ncan come from the data is the P yeah\nthat's yeah okay the P just the P not\nthe distribution itself okay but\nprobability of one person paying two\nperson paying yes and so that will not\nso for example so I want to find that\nnext month next month for a new customer\non next month how many people will pay\ntheir bills on\ntime that's user case now here's the way\nI do it I ask myself last month how many\npeople paid their bills on\ntime but it come but it may come from\nthe data so the P comes from the data\nbut the calculation for saying how many\npeople will pay their bills on time\ncomes from the next month it is done for\nthe next month it makes no sense to do\nit for this month because I already have\nthis month exactly but let's take a\nsituation that the probability that we\nadded right probability of 1%\nprobability of 2% the exact array that\nthe python yes entire the data for the\narray will it come from the past data it\nalready has because the p Has Come From\nthe Past data yeah that's the question I\nthat normally in a real situation that\nprobability has to be computed in a lab\nbased on past data right\nyes um Let me clarify that yes it came\ntoo quickly so there are complexities\none is you might be supposing that it\nchanges with time you might be you might\nbe in a situation that does this that\nyou know\nwhat I have two I have a collections\nproblem means not enough people are\npaying so I might have a problem that\nlooks like this that my my the number of\npeople who pay their bills on time is\n60% and I'm saying it's too low correct\nnow I want to increase that how to\nincrease that I my manager comes and\nsays make it so such that the number of\npeople say let's say more than five\npeople not paying on time this number\nmust be less than let's say\n.1% that's the goal now to do that I now\nneed to change my\nP so I'll set my P so that the answer to\nthis question becomes less than 0.1%\nthat gives me a Target P now I must\nreset my collection process so that that\nP is\nattained to achieve that P so I can do I\ncan create applications in various ways\ngive me the p and I will tell you what\nhappens or give me a situation that I\nwant to achieve and give me a Target P\nsuch that it gets there the constant and\nthe variables keeps yes the constant in\nthe variable keeps changing what do I\nwant to fix keeps changing so that dep\nthis is a model this is a mathematical\nmodel how you use it is up to\nyou this is one particular use case but\nthere'll be many use cases for this you\nsee one in logistic regression for\nexample the PO distribution is a very\nsimilar distribution except that for the\nporo distribution that has a mass\nfunction that looks like\nthis now this Mass\nfunction counts but does not count\nrelative to a\nmaximum the binomial goes from 0 to n 0\n1 2 up to n the posa there is no\nn there is no total number of things for\nexample I might ask the question how\nmany fraud cases do I expect to\nsee there's no sort of Maximum to that I\ncould frame it as saying that tell me\nthe total number of cases there are and\nthat is my n and then I'll figure out\nbased on a p how many fraud cases there\nare but there are situations where this\nmaximum is something that doesn't quite\nmake sense how many fraud cases are\nthere how many cracks are there micr\nfractures are there on this\nbottle it's a count right how many eggs\nwill the chicken\nlay it's a count it's not in some way a\nproportion like thing so if it's if\nyou're in a pure count like situation\nyou are in the situation of the\nso-called por distribution whose Mass\nfunction has this slightly different\nform called e ^ minus Lambda Lambda to\nthe^ X where Lambda is the average if on\nan average six customers arrive every 2\nminutes at a bank during busy working\nhours what is the probability that\nexactly four customers arrive in a given\nminute what is the probability that more\nthan three customers will arrive in a\ngiven minute this is slightly different\nfrom a binomial\nwhy the reason is in the previous case\nthey were asking for how many customers\ndid not pay but there was a total\nUniverse of customers seven customers\nthere was a sample sample space here\nthere isn't I'm not telling you how many\ncould have come there's a series and\nthat series could go up to anything so\nto\nspeak this is the typical situation of a\npersonal distribution where it's not a\nquestion of saying independent trials\nand how many were successes it is that\nI'm simply counting how many there are\nand I have no ideas to how many there\ncould have been potentially how many\nfraud cases I do not know how many micro\nfractures I do not know how many\ncustomers could have arrived I do not\nknow there's no maximum to it so there's\nsimilar calculation here for the same\nthing if you open the personal\ndistribution example\nfile now for the person distribution\nthat\nformula for the\nbinomial there were two numbers you\nneeded to put in the n and the P for the\nPoo there is only one\nnumber there is only one number and that\nnumber is usually called the rate the\nrate at which my customers are arriving\nthe rate at which I get fraud the rate\nor the density of of my\ncracks it's a rate number you can think\nof this rate number as a product of n\nand\np as as the total number of\nopportunities multiplied by the product\nif you want to think of it as that so\nfor the pora I need to be able to\nspecify the\nrate and now I do exactly the same thing\nI again calculate the poso probability\nstats. poso do pmf now for computational\npurposes I am setting the range from 0\nto 20 I can set to be any High number\nthat 20 is not coming from my data that\n20 is coming for a computational reason\nbecause I want to do the calculation for\na finite number of\npoints and as you'll see after 20 the\nnumbers are very very\nsmall so the 20 is not there from the\nproblem the 20 is there for my\nvisualization but how do you come to\nthat I can make it any make it any other\nnumber if you make it too low you'll be\nleaving some probability to the more\nthan 20 you make it too high you'll you\nwill be calculating a lot of zeros so\nwhat is my problem let's go here my\nproblem is what is the probability that\nexactly four customers arrive in a given\nminute six customers arrive every 2\nminutes at a bank what is the\nprobability that exactly four customers\narrive in a given minute what have I put\nmy rate\nas six and here is my distribution this\nis what 2.4 into 10 ^\nminus 3 so this is what\n0.2 let's see what happens so what is\nthe probability of 0\n02 what is it for\none1 for\ntwo for three 8 for\nfour no for what so no what is it for\nwhat is it for say this\nzero 1 2 2 3 4 what is it for\n4.13\n133% what is it for\nfive\n16% was it what is it for\nsix 16% what is the average number of\ncustomers I expect to see\nsix 16% what is it what is that seven\n133% for 8 10% now it start going down\nand it'll go down and by the time I've\nreached 20 it is already\n0000\n1 so if you had gone beyond 20 I would\nhave seen even smaller numbers but I\ncould have stopped for example let's say\nat 15 if I stopped at 15 where would\nthis have stopped 1 2 3 4 5 it would\nhave stopped\nhere which is\nfine\napproximation 20 20 is an approximation\n20 is 20 is a guess here is a\ndistribution plot the same thing this is\nthe plot of the distribution function\nwhose average is at\nsix by the way what is the answer to the\nquestion what is the probability that\nexactly four customers arrive in a given\nminute be slightly careful be slightly\ncareful six customers arrive every 2\nminutes the question asks for exactly\nfour customers arriving in 1\nminute which\nmeans if I'm yes if I'm putting six as\nthe\nrate then I have to convert this\nquestion to saying what is the\nprobability that exactly how many\ncustomers arrive every 2\nminutes each customers arrive every 2\nminutes or what I can do is I can change\nmy rate to three\nthis one is a distribution where you do\nmost of the calculations with this is\nthe normal\ndistribution the distribution that\ncorresponds to age to the mean spad all\nthe continuous variables that we were\nlooking at\nnumbers\nnumbers so if you're dealing with\nnumbers then you deal with a\ndistribution that has a shape like that\nthis is called the normal\ndistribution now the normal distribution\nthe reason I wanted to get to is this\nbecause because of this picture\nnow this picture puts the standard\ndeviation in context so yesterday we\ntalked about the standard deviation and\na question often asked is what does a\nstandard deviation mean what is standard\nabout the standard deviation this\npicture tells you what is standard about\nthe standard deviation so this picture\nmeans that if I have a normal\ndistribution then the chance of being\nwithin one standard deviation is\n68% as a numerical\nquantity this distribution is a\ndistribution that has a\nmean and it has a standard deviation now\nthe standard deviation has to be defined\nin such a way and the way the standard\ndeviation is defined implies that the\nchance of being within one standard\ndeviation is\n68% the chance of being within two\nstandard deviations is\n95% the chance of being within three\nstandard deviations is\n99.3%\nso now if I tell you something like this\nthat I'm telling you that for a group of\npeople the mean height is say 5' 10\nin with a standard deviation of 2\nin mean height\nis 5.2 in and a standard deviation of 2\nin right so mu so let's say 5 ft um 8 in\nand a standard deviation of\nsometimes denoted by Sigma of say 2\nin I've told you some interesting things\nif you allow me a normal\ndistribution I've now told you that 68%\nor roughly 2/3 of the people are between\n5' 6 in and 6\nft oh 10 in same\nStu this is 58\nthis is one standard deviation which is\ntwo and two so this is\n510 and this is 56 and this is about 68%\nsometimes it's easy to remember it as\n2/3 close\nenough two out of three are between\nthese two heights 95% are between what\nand\nwhat 6 and\n54 95 5% are between these two\nheights one and 20 are outside this\nrange so therefore if I tell you the\nmean and the standard deviation I've\nactually told you a reasonable amount as\nto how the data is\nspread so sometimes the mean and the\nstandard deviation are are reverse\nengineered so to speak so if you're a\nprofessional say I often do this so\npeople say people often ask where is the\ndata they said nobody has any data H so\nI say so so you know you're trying to\nfigure out what what work to get so so\nso so you might ask a question um when\ndo you typically arrive and someone says\noh uh 9:00 thereabouts what's your\nearliest arrival time\n8:30 what is your\nlatest\n10:00 so looking at this you'll now say\nso you you can decide as to what you\nshould assume that the whole range of\nthe distribution is say from say 8 8:30\nto\n10:00 and now this pattern tells you\nthat if I go for three sigma covering\n99.7% this whole range is about six\nstandard\ndeviations so to ex to look find the\nmean you just take the middle of it and\nto find the standard deviation you take\nthe whole range and divide by\nsix so I can get an idea of what the\naverage is and what the standard\ndeviation is without even getting any\ndata from you but just getting a sense\nof the extremes it's a nonsense way of\ndoing\nthings but what it does is it allows you\nto cheat with essentially very minimal\ninformation so remember this remember\nthese pictures they're helpful they give\nyou an idea of what the distribution is\nlike now by the way these numbers are\neasy enough to calculate so we'll do\nsome calculations the normal\ndistribution has a bell-shaped\ndistribution so it's\nsymmetrical the Tails could be extended\nit depends on two parameters mu and\nsigma see the power of it by giving you\ntwo numbers I've given you\ncharacteristics like this so and I can\ndo calculations and this is the density\nfunction that equation if you want to\nthink of it nobody does anything with\nthis but and then you can do\ncalculations on it so here's a here's a\ncalculation I'm not sure whether this is\na calculation that we had worked on um\nthis is a calculation that we actually\ndo in in some detail let's do it so the\nmean weight of normal of a morning break\nserial pack is 295 kg with a standard\ndeviation of 025 kg a random a random\nvariable weight of the pack follows a\nnormal distribution what is the\nprobability that the pack weighs less\nthan 280 G now why would someone be\ninterested in\nthis one possibility perhaps is that\nmaybe the target for the for the pack is\nsomething like 300\nG and you're trying to understand\nwhether you are\nwith in tolerances or more or less or\nsomething of that\nsort so what is the probability that the\npack weighs less than\n280\nkg so what do I need to do what is my\npicture\nlike my average\nis\n295 standard deviation\nof 25 on the gram scale and I want to\nfind the CH of being to the left\nof\n280 I need this\narea calculating this area is actually\nquite easy so let me calculate that area\nso I'm going to do it this\nway\nstats\ndot\nNorm dot\nCDF CDF stands\nfor cumulative distribution function\nI'll tell you what's cumulative about it\nCDF now what is the number that I'm\ninterested in probability of being less\nthan 280 or if I want to be very clear\nabout this\npoint Sorry 28 now I'm going to do\nsomething here comma location equal to\nlocation means the middle of the\ndistribution for me what is the\nmean 2\n95\ncomma scale is equal to what is the\nstandard\ndeviation is that right are the numbers\ncorrect\n27% this one here instead of0 28 you\nsaying it should be\n27 no I'm calculating the answer to this\nquestion what is the probability that\nthe pack weighs less than\n280 G this is the\nquestion to answer this the way I set it\nup was to\nsay that what is the chance of being\nless than\n280 when the mean is\n295 and the standard deviation\nis25 because of certain technical\naspects of other functions the mean here\nis referred to as location and the\nstandard deviation is referred to as\nscale huh so if those terms location and\nscale confuse you\njust ignore\nit huh this first term is the is the\nnumber but otherwise\nhuh this this this one\nhere this one here makes more sense fine\ngo ahead with\nthis all right do you understand how the\ncode\nworks all\nright let's do the second\nproblem what is the probability that the\npack weighs more than 350 G what do you\nthink the answer should be guess\noneus yes one minus\nwhat stats Norm 1 minus stats do Norm\nnow what should I do sorry norm.\nCDF\n350 comma same\nthing\nabout 1 39% 39% the chance of being more\nthan\n380 clear so what does CDF do\nCDF\ncumulative distribution\nfunction what does it do calculate the\narea to the left of less than therefore\nif I want to calculate the area\nprobability more than I need to go one\nminus why because the whole probability\nis\none what about the thirdd\none one what is the probability that the\npack weighs between 260 g and 340 G how\nto do\nthis yes\n340 so I now need to be between\n340 and what is it\n2\n260 so less than\n340 minus less than so it should be\nagain\nlet's say let's get\nlazy what is this\nnumber\n340 and this is 260\nright\n88% 8 8% of my packets are going to lie\nbetween 260 g and 340 G like this it's\nan assumption it's an assumption we are\nmaking remember there isn't any data at\nall\nhere there isn't any data at all here\nwhat numbers am I\nusing mean and standard\ndeviation so what I'm doing is what is\nthe advantage that I have I don't need\nthe data all I need is this mean and\nstandard deviation what is the price I\npay an assumption on the\ndistribution no so the I could instead\nof using Norm have another distribution\nsitting there there's a whole range\nother other possibilities Bome is one\nthere there are other distributions if\nyou want\nto you would you would decide based on\nwhichever distribution makes most sense\nfor your application\nnow in certain cases you know what those\nnature of those distributions look like\nfor example if you're looking at\nlifetimes of things it's an exponential\ndistribution or gamma distribution or\nsomething of that sort but there's a\ncertain advantage to the normal\ndistribution because of something called\nthe central limit theorem and we'll\ncover that a little bit of it will be\nmentioned when in the in in in in the\nnext residency Central limit theorem\nessentially says that if I take the\naverages of things or the totals of\nthings I end up with the normal\ndistribution the normal distribution is\na result of\naveraging so if my observation is a\ntotal of little\nthings then probably the normality\nassumption is a good assumption for\nthat large data doesn't necessarily mean\nnormal but if the observation is the\ntotal or the accumulation of lots of\nthings so for example height is often\nnormal why because our height is a is in\nsome way a random combination of many\nthings maybe the height of each of our\ncells and things of that\nsort so the normal distribution is often\nused as an assumption based on the\ncentral limit theorem the other part of\nit is that even if the data doesn't look\nlike a normal\ndistribution the the sort of generation\nfor it the sample from a normal\ndistribution doesn't necessarily look\nlike a sample from a normal\ndistribution so even like we saw\nyesterday the B shaped curve so it's\nhard to look at the data and say that it\nis not normal so the normal distribution\nis person to the that is often made um\nin the absence of you any other\ninformation on the data um it is\nobviously wrong in cases where the data\nhas a very strong\nskew in one sense to another but\nremember in many cases you're not even\ntalking about the data the question that\nyou're asking is not a data question the\nquestion that you're asking is a\nprobability question it's a situational\nquestion you're asking for effectively\nthe following thing why would some why\nwhy is this an analysis of this kind\ndone what data is it going after if\nanything you're talking about the data\nbeing normal or not normal what data is\nit even referring to why do I care about\nthe first\nquestion what is the probability that a\npack weighs less than 280 Gam one\ncontext for it could be that if a person\nbuys a pack what is the chance that\nthey're getting a a light pack in other\nwords something that is less than 280 G\nthe way you have to design your\npackaging also right true but my\nquestion is this where in all of that is\na\ndata where is the data in this how do\nyou even think of the data is it a data\nproblem at all I'm asking the question\nthat is my product in Spec in other\nwords what data are you referring to\nwhat is this a data science issue at\nall or is it not we asking the question\nis it normal is it not is is it a data\nquestion how you reach the customer yes\nand what kind of packaging sizes so what\nwhat data is\nthat so data of\nwhat data of my skus how many data\nobservations which data observations for\nwhom for which customer when what\ndata huh so kog quality check for what I\ncould argue for example that this is\nabout saying that if he goes in and buys\nthat breakfast cereal will he get\nsomething that is below 2 180 g for the\nvalue of the price we pay yes but where\nis the\ndata in the supermarkets for\nexamp there is no it's a business\nquestion what dat dat does it apply to\nwhat I'm trying to say is that it's not\na data problem at\nall you can solve it using you can say\nI'm going to gather a lot of data to\nsolve the\nproblem the data we already have on the\nbasis of which we\nhave no I'm telling you that this could\ncome from the past mean this could so\nyou could say that I'm going to I'm\ngoing to gather the data to get this\nnumber and get this number that's a good\nanswer that in order to solve my\nbusiness problem I need a mean and a\nstandard deviation so that I can get a\nhandle of what is the chance that it'll\nbe\nunderweight now that mean and standard\ndeviation has to come from somewhere and\nI can say I will use data to get that\nmean and the standard deviation that's a\ngood\nanswer that you'll now say why do I need\ndata in order to calculate mean and\nstandard deviation why do I mean mean\nand standard deviation because that's\nthe that's the least data I need in\norder to be able to answer this question\nwhich is the question I'm interested in\nanswering will he buy the product will\nmy network go down will I be under\nproduct there's a business question I'm\ninterested in answering or there's a\ntech question that I'm interested in\nanswering and often that is made\nindependently of the\ndata so for example the car has to stop\nautonomous\nvehicles right the the data that the car\nis going to react to is the scene that\nthe car sees in front of it but that's\nnot the data on which the algorithm is\ngoing to be\nbased so the the so the data that the\ncar sees is what it is reacting to\nsimilarly this is reacting to only one\nnumber 280\nG I'm now solving the 280 G Problem by\nsaying is it this so I'm giving you a\npacket and I'm asking the question is\nthis underweight does this have less\nwater than it\nshould I'm interested only in that I'm\nnot interested in any\ndata so in hypothesis testing what we'll\ndo when we come back is to be able to\nclose out that question and say\ntherefore from data how do we get to\nnumbers like\nthis which now means that I have to put\nthe two pieces of this residency\ntogether I have to put together the idea\nof calculating means and standard\ndeviations from\ndata to the idea that it is a parameter\nbeing estimated to solve a\nproblem so you would say that that data\nthis 295 comes from data that\nimmediately raises an issue but if it\ncomes from data it comes from a sample\nand if it comes from a sample it's not\naccurate and if it comes if it's not\naccurate then how well does it solve my\nproblem and life keeps going in circles\nlike\nthat so this is the probability side to\nit which explains why I need to have\nmeans and standard deviations in order\nto do a\ncalculation and the descriptive part\nsays I have the means and the standard\ndeviations to do the calculations so\ndoes that mean that when when I had the\nsample size yes uh sample set that if it\nhad normal distribution then I'm more\nreli no no if it had a normal\ndistribution then maybe I'd be able to\nget good numbers around this and the\nplus minuses would be\nsymmetric this calculation doesn't rely\non the normality behind the 4 295\nestimate this calculation lies on the\nnormal ity of the future data which\ndoesn't exist at all but what I'm asking\nis Will these numbers be more reliable\nthe MU and the sigma if I had normal\ndistribution no not necessarily not\nnecessarily if I have normal\ndistributions I'll be able to use\ncertain very specific formulas that\nwe'll see if it is not normal those\nformulas may break down a little bit so\nthose formulas help me\ncalculate huh so normality helps me\ncalculate it helps me\ncalculate how good these numbers are it\nalso helps me calculate using normality\nwhat the answers to questions such as\nthese\nare but the normality that I use right\nnow 10 minutes ago had nothing to do\nwith\ndata and that to some extent is the\npower of probability that you're being\nable to answer a question like saying do\nI expect that the weight is going to be\nless than 280\nG without having data in place for it\nthe simpler answer would be give me the\ndata and count how many are less than\n280 G that's the simplest\nanswer right what is the chance that the\npack less than 250 g empirical go\ncollect 100 packets and find out how\nmany of them have weight less than 280\ngam that's the answer to that\nquestion so why are we doing all of this\nbecause you don't have\nthat because you don't have that\ndata why don't you have that data\nbecause that's not the question I'm\nasking I'm asking the question is it\nless than 200 80 g I'm looking at a\ncomputer program in front and I'm asking\nwhat is the chance that there are more\nthan five bugs in this\ncode I'm looking at all the computers in\nmy office and I'm asking um what is the\nchance that all of the employees today\nthere's going to be more than two\nhacks or malicious attempts on my\nserver there is no data\nyet there will be but by that time the\nhacks\nhappened but I still need those numbers\nand I get those numbers using these\ndistributions to operationalize those\ndistributions I need certain numbers and\nI can guess them I can beg them I can\nborrow them I can steal them I can\nestimate them from data I can ask for a\nfriend I can read a\nbook see a standard I can look at market\nresearch yes I can do any number of\nthings in order to get at those numbers\nI can look at an industry\nstandard those two pieces will put\ntogether Shi is getting really nervous H\nnoral this this picture is definitional\nfor the normal\ndistribution this picture this is\ndefinitional for the normal distribution\nso if you look at Six Sigma 6 Sigma will\ncover\n99.7% 3 out of a th000 will lie outside\nthe plusus 3 Sigma range not everything\nbut roughly\n3,000\nthis is 3 Sigma 6 Sigma 3 Sigma usually\nsays 3.4 defects per million\nopportunities which is actually not 6 3\nSigma is not 6 Sigma it's 4.5\nSigma so 4.5 Sigma is about 3.4 into 10^\nminus\n6 that's 4.5 Sigma so if you look at Six\nSigma literature there's a confusion\nthere basically what it says is that if\nyou\nhave in order to get 3.4 defects per\nmillion to the customer you have to be\nwithin Six Sigma which is about one in a\nbillion this is at this is at three\nstandard deviations plusus three\nstandard deviations if I go to plus- 4.5\nstandard deviations I'll be at around\n3.4 into the^ minus 6 to reach that for\nthe customer I need to go to Six Sigma\nhere which is about one in a billion I\nmust be more accurate in my factory\nfloor for my customer so if I reach Six\nSigma my customer will reach 4.5 Sigma\nand four customer 4.5 Sigma is the 3.4\n10 the^ minus 6 so if you look at 3.4\nthe^ minus 6 it doesn't correspond to 6\nSigma little confusing\nbut that's the way Six Sigma literature\nis written normal distribution is the\nnormal distribution is just this as a\nformula Plus or plus plus or plus orus 2\nSigma is 95% actually actually plus or\nminus 1.96 Sigma is\n95% and 3 Sigma is about\n99.7%\nInfinity by definition goes to Infinity\nyou want to cover everything plus minus\ninfinite standard\ndeviation\n",
