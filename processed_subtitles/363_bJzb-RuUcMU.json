  "text": "what's up guys this is crack ho to\nwelcome back to a brand new video in\nthis video I'm gonna show you guys on\nhow to learn programming for absolutely\nfree now before we start this video\nthere are some things you guys should\nknow about this first and foremost you\ndon't need any experience or knowledge\nto learn programming whatsoever so you\ncan be a complete novice and not know\nany sort of code or anything about\ncomputers that doesn't matter in this\ncase you guys can learn for free and\neasily the second thing is you don't\nneed to pay a single cent for this and\nit will always be free there are those\nservices where you sit down on the\ncomputer and you're learning something\nand then you notice like a week later\nthe trial ended and then you have to pay\nthat's not gonna happen again this is\ncompletely free so you don't have to\nworry about that so with that being said\nwhy should you learn to code or to\nprogram it's simple when you guys are\nnot programming you can become a web\ndeveloper and later on a full-stack\ndeveloper so you could be sitting at\nhome on a computer drinking your coffee\nlearning the code and then a couple\nmonths later you go on the online web\nand you go to freelancing sites and like\nup were calm and then you start making\nmoney and you help people out and you\nget paid for working at home I know\ncountless of people my age and younger\nthan weed are sixteen making hundreds\nand even thousands of dollars a month so\nit's all worth it how do you get started\nI'm gonna show you guys that right now\nit's a free website that you guys can\nsee down in the description link below\ncalled free code camp org now I'm gonna\ngo ahead and show you guys this but real\nquick just so you guys know as a\ndisclaimer I do not own the site and I\nam not affiliated with the site I\npersonally use this website to learn\ncode myself which is why I'm spreading\nthe word and spreading the launch to you\nguys so with that being said let's begin\nokay so we're here at free code camp org\nnow to start it's simple all you guys\ngot to do is click the orange start\ncoding button right here and from there\nyou guys can go ahead and continue the\nGoogle or with Facebook or with email\ndoesn't matter I'm gonna go ahead and\njust for this example put in the temp\nemail just to show you guys you can do\nthe same thing put in an email address\nemail and then put the code in that you\nfrom the email and then click submit'\ncode and continue to free code camp and\nfrom there all you guys are going to do\nis click on you go to coding curriculum\nonce you guys are on a coding curriculum\nyou're gonna get three sections of the\nscreen the guide section the editor\nsection on the center and the live\nproduction section on the right side of\nthe screen so following the left side of\nthe screen you guys gonna get a tutorial\nand then you're gonna get a little\nchallenge you guys are gonna have to\npass the challenge so in this case I'm\ngonna go ahead and have to do an h1\nelement and type in hello world that's\nwhat it's asking you to do run the test\nyou can see we did it and then we go to\nthe next challenge the next challenge\nagain you just got to follow the\ninstructions this time we have to do an\nh2 element and do a cat photo app text\nso do that and you guys get the idea\nbasically what you guys want to do is\nmake sure you follow the instructions\ncarefully I highly recommend you guys\nget a notebook and take notes along the\nway it does get very easy it is very\neasy to start with but it will get more\nand more challenging and if you guys are\ngetting stuck while doing this you don't\nhave to worry you can click on get a\nhint and it'll give you guys a hint on\nwhat to do or if you're absolutely stuck\nand you want to see how you can do it\nhow you can pass it then you can watch a\nvideo and it will tell you exactly what\nyou did wrong and show you the right way\nand that's pretty much it so in\nconclusion we learned that there's a\nprogram you guys can use and it does\nlook simple at first but it progresses\nand gets more difficult so you guys are\nresponsible for sitting through the\nlessons and trying to check off each of\nthe lessons you guys learned beginning\nwith HTML and then CSS visual design and\neventually JavaScript there's hundreds\nand hundreds of countless of hours of\nfree learning you guys can get with this\nyou're gonna be sitting there and\nthinking about the challenge you're\ngonna be like wow this is very difficult\nhow do I move on to the next challenge\nso you really have to test yourself and\ntake notes as I mentioned I will really\nhelp you out but at the end of the day\nit was all worth it thank you guys so\nmuch for watching this video I really\nhope it helped you guys out if you have\nany comments or suggestions on what\nvideos you guys want me to do next go\nahead and comment them below and with\nthat being said I'll see you guys next\ntime\nyou\n",
