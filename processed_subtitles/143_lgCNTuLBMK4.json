  "text": "Hi my name is Will and i'm going to give  \nyou a step-by-step guide to the \ndata analysis process, let's go!\nin this video we're going to go through the five \nkey stages of the data analysis process we're  \ngoing to give you an overview and an introduction \nto each of these stages as well as looking at some  \nof the tools you'll use to undertake these stages \nso let's dive into step one defining the question  \nthe first step in your data analysis process \nor any data analysis process is to define your  \nobjective in data analytics terms this is called \nthe problem statement defining your objective  \nmeans coming up with a hypothesis and figuring \nout how exactly to test it you can start by asking  \nwhat business problem am i trying to solve now i \nknow this might sound straightforward but it can  \nactually be trickier than it seems for instance \nyour organization's senior management might pose a  \nquestion such as why are we losing customers it's \npossible though that this doesn't get to the core  \nof the problem a data analyst job is to understand \nthe business and the business's goals as a data  \nanalyst you need to understand this in enough \ndepth that they can frame the problem the right  \nway to give you a practical example let's say you \nwork for a fictional company for example we'll  \ncall it top notch learning this fictional company \ntop notch creates custom training software for its  \nclients in this example top notch is excellent \nat securing new clients but unfortunately top  \nnotch has much lower repeat business as such as a \ndata analyst your question might not be why are we  \nlosing customers but which factors are negatively \nimpacting the customer experience or even better  \nyet how can we boost customer retention whilst \nminimizing costs now you've identified the problem  \nyou need to find which data is going to help \nyou solve this issue this is where your business  \nacronym comes in again for instance perhaps \nyou've noticed that the sales pipeline for new  \ncustomers is very slick but the production team \nis extremely inefficient knowing this you could  \nhypothesize the sales process actually wins a lot \nof new clients but the customer experience well  \nit's kind of lacking could this be the reason that \ncustomers aren't coming back what sources of data  \nwill help you answer this question as a data \nanalyst considering all these things will help  \nyou define the question and help you solve the \nproblem at hand there's also a number of tools  \nthat can help you define your objective defining \nyour objective is mostly about soft skills so  \nbusiness knowledge and lateral thinking but you'll \nalso need to consider business metrics and key  \nperformance indicators and these are called KPIs \nmonthly reports can help you track problem points  \nin the business there are lots of tools out there \non the market that can analyze this business data  \ntools like Databox and DashaRoo there's also free \nopen source software like Grafana freeboard and  \nDashbuilder these are fantastic for producing \nsimple dashboards both at the beginning and at  \nthe end of the data analysis process so that was \nstep one defining the objective onto step two step  \ntwo collecting the data once you've established \nyour objective you'll need to create a strategy  \nfor collecting and aggregating the appropriate \ndata a key part of this is determining which  \ndata you need this might be quantitative data or \nnumeric data eg sales figures or monthly reports  \nor qualitative descriptive data such as customer \nreviews all of this data fits into one of three  \ncategories first party second party and third \nparty data let's explore each one briefly now  \nwhat is first party data first party data is data \nthat you or your company has directly collected  \nfrom customers it might for example come in the \nform of transactional tracking data or information  \nfrom your customer relationship management \nsystem your CRM system whatever it source  \nfirst party data is usually collected in a clear \nand structured way other sources of first party  \ndata might include customer satisfaction surveys \nfocus groups interviews or direct observation  \nlet's talk about second party data to enrich your \nanalysis you might want to secure a secondary data  \nsource second party data is simply the first \nparty data of other organizations this might  \nbe available directly from the company or from \nprivate marketplace the main benefit of second  \nparty data is that it's usually structured \nand although it's less relevant than first  \nparty data it tends to be reliable examples of \nsecond party data include website app or social  \nmedia activity like online purchase history or \nshipping data so lastly what is third-party data  \nthird-party data is data that has been collected \nand aggregated from numerous sources from a third  \nparty often but not always third-party data \ncontains a lot of unstructured data or big data  \nmany organizations collect this big data to create \nindustry reports or to conduct market research the  \nresearch and advisory firm Gartner is a good real \nworld example of an organization that collects big  \ndata and then sells it on to other companies open \ndata repositories and government portals are also  \nsources of third third-party data let's take \na moment to look at some of the tools that you  \ncan use to collect data once you've devised this \ndata strategy ie you've identified what data you  \nneed and how best to go about collecting it there \nare many tools that you can use to help you one  \nthing you'll need regardless of industry or area \nof expertise is a data management platform or DMP  \na DMP is a piece of software which allows you to \nidentify and aggregate data from numerous sources  \nbefore they're manipulating them segmenting them \nand so on there are many DMPs available some  \nwell-known enterprise DMPs include salesforce DMP, \nSAAS and the data integration platform Xplenty if  \nyou want to play around you can also try some open \nsource platforms like Pymcore or Dswarm on to step  \nthree cleaning the data once you've collected your \ndata the next step is to get it ready for analysis  \nthis means cleaning or scrubbing it and this is \ncrucial to make sure that you're working with  \nhigh quality data key data cleaning tasks include \nremoving major errors duplicates or outliers all  \nof which are problems when you aggregate data \nfrom numerous sources removing unwanted data  \npoints so extracting irrelevant observations that \nhave no bearing on your intended analysis bringing  \nstructure to your data or general housekeeping \nso for example fixing typos or layout issues  \nwhich will help you map or manipulate your data \nmore easily and finally it helps filling in major  \ngaps as you're tidying up you might notice that \nimportant data is missing once you've identified  \nthese gaps you can go about filling them a good \ndata analyst will spend about 70 to 90 of their  \ntime cleaning data this might sound excessive but \nfocusing on the wrong data or analyzing error in  \nthis data will severely impact your results it \nmight even send you back to square one so whatever  \nyou do don't rush this step let's have a look \nat some of the tools that you can use to clean  \nyour data cleaning data manually especially large \ndata sets can be incredibly daunting but luckily  \nthere are many tools available to streamline this \nprocess open source tools such as open refine are  \nexcellent for basic data cleaning as well as high \nlevel exploration however free tools offer limited  \nfunctionality for very large data sets now i know \nthis sounds like a data zoo but python libraries  \nsuch as pandas and some r packages are better \nsuited to heavy data scrubbing you will of course  \nneed to be savvy with languages alternatively \nenterprise tools are also available for example  \ndata ladder which is one of the highest rated data \nmatching tools in the industry there are many more  \nwhy don't you see which data cleaning tools you \ncan find online share your free tools in the  \ncomments below so that was step three cleaning \nthe data on to step four analyzing that data  \nfinally once you've cleaned your data now comes \nthe fun bit analyzing it the type of data analysis  \nyou conduct largely depends on what your goal is \nbut there are many techniques available univariate  \nor bivariate analysis time series analysis and \nregression analysis are just a few you might  \nhave heard of more important than the different \ntypes though is how you apply them this depends  \non what types of insights you're hoping to gain \nbroadly speaking all types of data analysis fit  \ninto the four following categories descriptive \nanalysis which is analysis which identifies what  \nhas already happened this is a common first step \nthat companies do before proceeding with deeper  \nexplorations diagnostic analysis where the focus \nis on understanding why something has happened  \nit is literally the diagnosis of a problem just \nas a doctor uses the symptoms to diagnose the  \npatient's disease predictive analysis which is \nwhere you identify future trends by the analysis  \nof historical data predictive analysis is commonly \nused by businesses to forecast future growth and  \nlastly prescriptive analysis which allows \nyou to make recommendations for the future  \nthis is the final step in the analytics part \nof the process but it's also the most complex  \nthis is because it incorporates aspects of all \nthe other analyses that we've described today  \nstep 5 sharing your results you've finished \ncarrying out your analyses you have your insights  \nthe final step of a data analysis process is to \nshare these insights with the wider world or at  \nleast with your organization's stakeholders this \nis actually more complex than just sharing the raw  \nresults of your work it involves interpreting the \noutcomes and presenting them in a manner which is  \ndigestible to everybody that's in the room since \nyou'll also present your work to decision makers  \nit's very important that the insights that you \nshare are 100 clear and also unambiguous for  \nthis reason data analysts usually use reports \ndashboards and interactive visualizations to  \nsupport their findings how you interpret and \npresent results will often influence the direction  \nof the business depending on what you share \nyour organization might decide to restructure to  \nlaunch a new product or close an entire division \nthat's why it's very important to present all the  \nevidence that you gathered and not to cherry-pick \ndata ensuring that you cover everything in a clear  \nand concise way will prove that your conclusions \nare scientifically sound and based on facts on the  \nflip side it's important to highlight any gaps \nin the data or to flag any insights that might  \nbe open to interpretation remember that honest \ncommunication is an important part of the process  \nit will help the business but it will also help \nyou to excel at your job there's a ton of tools  \nfor interpreting and sharing your findings these \ntools are suited to different experience levels  \nbut popular tools that require no coding skills \ninclude Google Charts, Tableau, Datawrapper and  \nInfogram if you're familiar with python and \nr there are also many data visualization  \nlibraries and packages available for instance \ncheck out the Python libraries Plotty, Seaborn  \nand Matplotlib whichever data visualization \ntools you use make sure that you polish up your  \npresentation skills too visualization is great \nbut communication is key so hopefully now you  \nhave a better idea of the data analysis process \nCareerFoundry have an awesome data analytics short  \ncourse and you can sign up for free by
