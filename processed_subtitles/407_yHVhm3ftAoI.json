  "text": "data visualization encompasses all\naspects of the visual representation of\ndata in today's world we are dealing\nwith huge sets of data where there is a\nneed of visualization for sure in such a\nscenario tools become prominent to eight\npeople in understanding the significance\nof data through visual aids like\npatterns Trends dashboards and charts hi\nall I welcome you to this session and\ntoday we are going to list the top 10\nmost popular data visualization tools\nbut before we begin let's look at our\nagenda for today so first of all we're\ngoing to talk about data visualization\nas a concept as in what it means to\nvisualize data what are the different\nparts of data visualization the\ncomponents which form data visualization\nand why do we need it next we're going\nto talk a little bit about data\nvisualization tools the purpose that\nthey serve and what is it that all the\nbest data visualization tools have in\ncommon it will also give you a fair idea\nof how we've come up with our list we're\ngoing to talk about the different areas\nin which we are charging these tools\nthen finally we are going to enlist the\ntop 10 visualization tools according to\nus for the year 2020. here we are going\nto be talking about the pros and cons of\nsaid tool along with the open source\navailability and pricing of the tool so\nwith that we come to the end of our\nagenda so without much to do let's get\nstarted so what is data visualization in\ndefinitive terms data visualization\ncombines scientific visualization\ninformation visualization and visual\nanalytics to Encompass designing and\nAnalysis of the visual representation of\ndata it is basically a technique or a\nset of techniques of communicating\ninformation through a graphical or a\nvisual medium Now understand that\nconsuming large sets of data isn't\nalways a straightforward method\nsometimes these data sets are so large\nand so unstructured that its downright\nimpossible to discern anything useful\nfrom them and this is where data\nvisualization techniques come in\nyou have thousands of different entries\nall of different formats and you have to\ncreate one visualization from scratch\nshow it's possible but definitely not\nsimple so generalized data visualization\ninvolves different disciplines such as\nInformation Technology Natural Sciences\nstatistical analysis Graphics\ninteraction and geographic information\nbut three in particular that I want to\ntalk about is scientific visualization\ninformation visualization and visual\nanalytics which are the three main\ndisciplines which contribute to data\nvisualization\nso scientific visualization is basically\nan interdisciplinary research and\napplication field in science it focuses\non visualization of three-dimensional\nphenomena such as architecture\nmeteorology medicine or biological\nsystems its purpose is to graphically\nillustrate scientific data which in turn\nenables scientists to understand explain\nand collect patterns from data then we\nhave information visualization which is\nthe study of interactive visual\nrepresentations of abstract data to\nenhance human cognition abstract data\nincludes both digital and non-digital\ndata such as geographic information and\ntext\nGraphics such as histograms Trend graphs\nflowcharts and tree diagrams all belong\nto information visualization and the\ndesign of these Graphics transforms\nabstract Concepts into visual\ninformation and finally you have visual\nanalytics this is a new field that has\nevolved with the development of\nscientific visualization and information\nvisualization this has an emphasis on\nanalytical reasoning through interactive\nvisual interface basically this is what\naids your drill down processes in any\ndata visualization platform now I want\nto discuss for a little bit why do we\nneed data visualization now the amount\nof information that humans gain through\nvision is far beyond that of other\nsensory organs data visualization is the\nuse of your human natural skills to\nenhance data processing and organization\nefficiency so visualization can\nbasically help us deal with more complex\ninformation and enhance its place in our\nmemory now most people do not know much\nabout statistical data and basic\nstatistical methods are not in line with\nhuman cognitive nature one of the more\nfamous examples is the and scombius\nquartet it is difficult to see the law\naccording to the statistical methods but\nthe rules are immediately cleared when\nthis data is visualized and technically\nthe simplest understanding of data\nvisualization is actually mapping\nstraight from data space to your graphic\nspace a classic visual implementation\nprocedure is to process and filter the\ndata transform it into an expressible\nvisual form and then render it to a user\nvisible View and that's where data\nvisualization tools come in\ndata visualization tools provide you\nwith an easier way to create visual\nrepresentations of enormous data sets\nwhen dealing with data sets that include\nhundreds of thousands of millions of\ndata points automating the process of\ncreating a visualization at least in\npart makes your job significantly easier\nthese data visualizations can then be\nused for a variety of purposes such as\ndashboards annual reports sales and\nmarketing materials investor slide decks\nand virtually anywhere else information\nneeds to be interpreted immediately\nnow what do the best data visualization\ntools have in common now the best data\nvisualization tools on the market have a\ncouple things in common first is their\nease of use there's some incredibly\ncomplicated apps available for\nvisualizing data some have excellent\ndocumentations and tutorials and a\ndesign in ways that feel intuitive to\nthe user others are lacking in those\nareas eliminating them from the list of\nbest tools regardless of their other\ncapabilities the best tools can also\nhandle huge sets of data in fact the\nvery best can even handle multiple sets\nof data in a single visualization these\ntools can also output an array of\ndifferent charts graphs and map types\nmost of the tools that I have enlisted\nhere can output both images and\ninteractive graphs there are exceptions\nto the variety of output criteria though\nsome data visualization tools focus on a\nspecific type of chart or map and do it\nexceedingly well those tools also have a\nplace among the vegetables out here\nfinally there are cost considerations of\ncosts while a higher price tag doesn't\nnecessarily disqualify a tool the higher\nprice tag has to be justified in terms\nof better support better features and\noverall value now there are dozens if\nnot hundreds of applications tools and\nscripts available to create\nvisualizations of large data sets many\nare very basic and have a lot of\noverlapping features as well but there\nare standouts that either have more\ncapability for the types of\nvisualizations they can create or\nsignificantly easier to use than other\ntools that are listed here now when I\nsay tools I mean applications and\nsoftware platforms and I'm not going to\nbe including libraries\nwe're going to keep that for another\nsession\nso let's go ahead with our list\nat number 10 we have infogram now this\nis a web-based data visualization and\ninfographics Tool which permits users to\ncreate and share digital charts\ninfographics and Maps it has an\nintuitive editor known as what you see\nis what you get which transforms your\ndata into shareable infographics\nnow couple of Pros that stand out are\nthat you need absolutely no coding\nskills to use this tool it is available\nin a free version it allows you to\nconnect your visualizations to live and\npublic data sources as well as gives you\na choice of over 35 types of charts and\n200 different types of maps that's\nimpressive isn't it apart from that it\nis also a great platform if you want to\nhandle complex data however there are a\ncouple of pitfalls here mostly\npertaining to the free version of this\ntool\nfirstly the free version mandates you to\ninclude the Instagram logo in your\ndesigns as well as lacks the rich text\nediting feature also I feel that it\nlacks in a few data integration features\nwhen compared to others on this list now\nthe basic version of this tool comes\nfree of cost and pro versions cost\naround 19 a month the business version\nwill cost you 67 and the team version is\npriced at 149 for the Enterprise version\nyou can customize it by contacting the\nvendor also both free and licensed\nversions are available in the store\nat number nine we have citizens now this\nprovides instant insights for anyone and\nanywhere in your organization it allows\nyou to create visual dashboards and\nreports to State any piece of data\nuncover unlying Trends and patterns to\nmake data-driven decisions now certain\npros of having is that it has an\nextremely user-friendly interface while\nalso providing great analysis\nperformance on larger data sets along\nwith that it has excellent support easy\nupgrades and integrates extremely well\nwith different data sources this product\nis very flexible and allows for easy\ncustomization its cons include\ndifficulty to maintain and develop\nanalytic cubes and also if a cube is\nrebuilt it is required to become\ninaccessible during that period it also\ndoes not have any inbuilt data type to\nsupport the time format and has limited\ntype of visualization now pricing is not\ndisclosed by assistance however it\noffers a no surprise pricing package\nwhere the cost is determined on a\ncase-by-case basis depending upon the\ndata size and number of users it also\nhas a free trial available at number\neight we have find report so this is an\nEnterprise level web programming tool\nwritten in pure Java it combines data\nvisualization as well as data entry and\nis designed based on a no code\ndevelopment concept\nwith find report users can make complex\nreports and cool dashboards and build a\ndecision-making platform with simple\ndrag and drop operations it also is one\nof the connoisseurs of this sort of easy\nUI now find report can be directly\nconnected to all sorts of databases and\nit is convenient and quick to customize\nvarious complex reports and dashboards\nthe interface is similar to that of\nExcel and IT provides 19 categories and\nover 50 styles of self-developed HTML5\ncharts it also gives you these really\nfun 3D and dynamic effects to go with it\nand the most important thing is that its\npersonal version is completely free\nhowever it is only a sample and does not\nallow intuitive views and will also\nleave you wanting to learn more about\nusing Advanced tools such as\nincorporating JS and Java which in case\nif you do not know much about Java will\nbe difficult for you to use use at\nnumber seven we have Google charts now\nthis is a very powerful easy to use and\ninteractive data visualization tool for\nbrowsers and mobile devices it has a\nrich gallery of charts and allows you to\nget it customized as per your needs\nnow the rendering of these charts are\nbased on the HTML5 SVG technology and it\nprovides you with Pros such as its\nSimplicity to learn user friendliness\nit's speed and accuracy great\ninteractivity three years of backwards\ncompatibility as well as cross browser\ncompatibility and cross-platform\nportability with any additional plugins\nand all of this completely free apart\nfrom that it supports iPhone iPad and\nAndroid and can read from multiple data\nsources including Excel SQL databases\nCSV Google spreadsheets so on and so\nforth this tool is completely free but\ncomes with his own set of pitfalls which\ninclude a mandatory network connection\nwhile using the tool the absence of\ndemos on Advanced features along with a\nlack of sophisticated statistical\nprocessing working with API for complex\npresentations is also sometimes\ndifficult to learn\nnext we have grafana now this is an open\nsource visualization software that lets\nusers create Dynamic dashboards and\nother forms of reports it supports mixed\ndata sources annotations and\ncustomizable alert functions it can also\nbe extended via hundreds of available\nplugins and that makes it one of the\nmost powerful visualization tools out\nthere you have export functions which\nallow designers to share snapshots of\ndashboards as well as invite other users\nto collaborate grafana supports over 50\ndata sources via plugins it's a\ncompletely free to download and there's\na cloud hosted version for fort nine\ndollars a month there's also a very\nlimited free hosted version\nnow if you have a downloadable version\nthere are support plans available\nsomething a lot of other open source\ntools don't offer but then again it\ndefinitely is an overkill for creating\nsimple visualization does not offer as\nmany visual customization options as\nsome of its competitors and is not the\nbest option for creating visualization\nimages and the final con would be its\ninability to embed dashboards in\nwebsites though it is possible for\nindividual panels\nand hence it is not higher on our list\nhaving said that grafana is one of the\nbest options for creating dashboards for\ninternal use especially if you're using\nmixed or larger uncategorized data\nsources\nat number 5 we have Dundas now this is a\nvery old and popular data visualization\ntool and thus definitely stood the test\nof time and for good reason it offers\nsuper interactive visualizations which\nAid the users to understand data faster\nand better its other visualization\nfeatures include Rich scorecards smart\ntables numerous chart types gauges Maps\ndata labels sparkline indicators\ndiagrams and relationships this tool is\ngrounded on responsive HTML5 webtech\nwhich allows the users to connect\ninteract and analyze their data on any\ndevice from anywhere apart from that it\nhas great ETL capabilities while\nallowing us to write direct SQL against\ndata sources that we choose it has\namazing flexibility in design and comes\nwith really good support and let's not\nforget it's amazing library of\nvisualizations the cons of Dundas are\nfew which is why it is so high up on our\nlist it does not offer predictive\nanalysis which most newer data\nvisualization tools do and it also lacks\nsupport on 3D charts apart from that it\nfollows a one-time license and\nsubscription-based pricing model but has\na free trial available however Dundas bi\npricing and details are based on a\nflexible licensing model that adapts to\nyour needs and that of your business\nwhich is why it is not disclosed by the\nvendor at number 4 we have adaptive\ninsights\nspecifically being designed for business\nusers the Adaptive Discovery tool\nadaptive insights allows focusing on\nyour analysis and decision making on\nwhat is important to you with\ninteractive drill down and visual\nstorytelling you can identify the root\ncauses answer questions on the Fly and\nspot Trends to address the issues ahead\nof the curve it gives you a complete\nperspective that you shall need to drive\nfor financial sales and operational\nperformances it also allows you to model\nplan and forecast to make Better\nBusiness decisions some of the things we\nlike about adaptive Discovery is the\nability to connect to any data source be\nit Erp CRM or HCM it has personalized\ndashboards modular metrics as well as\nshared metrics and the information is at\nyour fingertips from anywhere with\nanalytics delivered completely on the\ncloud while this tool equips you with\nout of the box planning budgeting and\nfocus costing processes sometimes the\nresponsiveness is extremely slow due to\nthe use of java initially it is a bit\ndifficult to learn this tool mainly\nbecause of setting up your reports but\nonce you get the hang of it you should\nbe fine\napart from that it's actually pretty\ndifficult to modify reports without\ncreating a new one on this tool and the\noverall reporting functionality in our\nopinion could be improved like many\nothers on this list you need to contact\nthe company for pricing details it has a\nsubscription based pricing model and the\nprice will be determined by the number\nof instances that you want to opt for\nthe tool is available in two editions\nwhich is the Adaptive Discovery\nprofessional and the Enterprise version\nnow though it is a licensed tool it does\nhave a free trial version available with\nthat we've come to our top three tools\nat number three we have Microsoft power\nbi now this is one of the more commonly\nused bi tools which allows you to\nconnect to a wide variety of data\nsources design customize dashboards and\ndetailed reports and supports both\nmobile and web-based analytics it has\nPros such as being cloud-based giving a\nsingle view of the dashboard its\naffordability and since it's a Microsoft\ntool it has a very strong brand\nintegration with other Ms tools a lot of\ndocumentation about this tool is also\nfreely available online along with a big\nand active Community Helping you resolve\nyour doubts a wide variety of charting\noptions for data visualizations are\navailable with consistent upgrades and\nan extensive database connectivity which\nhopefully will cover up for how\ndifficult it is to learn and its\ninability to handle bulk data you shall\nsometimes face a certain lag when you\nare using huge volumes of data sets also\nthe cloud version does not have all the\nfeatures available in the windows\nversion but the good news is that it is\navailable in both free and pro versions\nand has two Enterprise pricing plans the\nfirst one is totally free with 1GB data\nstorage limit and the second plan which\nis the Pro Plan costs less than 10\ndollars per user per month which also\nhas its own data storage limit of 10 GB\nat number 2 we have water graph now this\ntool is different from the others and\nprovides marketing agencies with an easy\nway of reporting marketing campaign data\nto their clients this platform creates\nvisual data that is easy to comprehend\nno matter who your reporting results to\ncertain features include its seamless\nintegration with over 40 of the top\ndigital marketing platforms such as\nGoogle analytics Facebook ads and\nMailChimp it has endless customization\noptions and you can have your pick from\nvirtually hundreds of different pre-made\nreporting widgets or create your own\nmethods of presenting data now on the\nstool cross-platform data analysis is\nextremely simple and it gives you a\ngreat way to compare different marketing\nplatforms and their performance in one\nreport automated report creation and\ndelivery is also brilliant when you use\nthe service and when managing a variety\nof clients automation features can help\nprocess and deliver data to the right\nclients with minimal input on your\nbehalf along with this it comes with\nsomething known as white label reports\nwhich helps you customize the report the\nway you see fit add your own images or\nlogo and let your branding shine through\nwith each report you create\nwater graph is a feature-rich marketing\ndata reporting platform for agencies to\nuse it makes easy work of managing\nmultiple clients while aiding you with a\nplethora of Integrations and automation\nfunctionality not just that the water\ngraph pricing differs based on the\nfeatures you want to use there is no\nneed to overpay for the features that\nyou are never going to use\nthe only con that we see here is the\nlack of Versatility\nit is more of something that marketing\nagencies would use for marketing\ncampaigns and less of everything else\nwhich is why it's not on the top of our\nlist but then what is\nfinally at number one we have Tableau\nnow Tableau is a business intelligence\nservice that aids people in visualizing\nas well as understanding their data it's\nalso one of those very widely used\nservices in the field of business\nintelligence which allows you to design\ninteractive reports dashboards and\nworksheets to obtain business Visions it\nhas outstanding visualization\ncapabilities and has a great performance\ndespite the size of data sets it is easy\nto use and comes with a healthy\ncommunity and forum and offers great\nconnectivity to multiple data sources it\nis mobile friendly it has powerful\ncomputation and quick insights but it\ncomes at a price of 70 dollars per user\nper month billed annually you have no\noption for scheduling and auto\nrefreshing of reports and it has\nrestrictive visual Imports static\nparameters need to be updated manually\neach time when the data gets modified\nand a lot of users find column table\nformatting extremely difficult to do\nhowever it comes in a public version\nwhich is an open source version where is\nabsolutely free and has almost all the\nfeatures of the paid version and the\nlicensed version also has a free trial\navailable for two weeks having said that\nthis software allows data mixing and\nreal-time collaboration it doesn't Force\nusers to write custom code and all in\nall is one of the simplest business\nintelligence tools in the desktop system\nwhich is why it tops our list of the top\n10 data visualization tools of 2020 data\nvisualization is a huge field with many\ndisciplines it's precisely because of\nthis interdisciplinary nature that the\nvisualization field is full of Vitality\nand opportunities with that I come to\nthe end of my session my name is upasana\nthank you and have a great day\n",
