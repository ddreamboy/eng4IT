  "text": "So you want to become a web developer\nand you start learning html, css,\nand javascript. But then you start\nhearing about these javascript\nframeworks. Should I learn angular or\nreact.js, or maybe backbone, or vuejs, or\nember, or knockout, meteor, mithril, ractive,\npolymer, svelte etc\nSo what are javascript frameworks and\nwhy are there so many of them?\nFront-end web development is all about\ndisplaying things on a web page,\nalso known as rendering. Let's say we\nhave a list of youtube comments\nand we want to render it on a web page\nto look like this. We could create this\nusing html, and css,\nbut every video has different comments,\nso we need to write different html for\nevery video on\nyoutube. A better solution is javascript\nwe save the comments in a javascript\nobject,\nand then write some code to render it. If\nwe need to render different comments we\njust swap out the comments.\nUsing plain javascript to implement this,\nthe code looks like this.\nUsing a framework, we can write our code\nlike this, and the framework converts\nthis into plain javascript for you.\nAnd that's why we use frameworks, it\nmakes rendering so much easier.\nSo why are there so many frameworks.\nJavascript doesn't have an official\nframework like other languages,\nso developers are free to create their\nown, and boy did they make\nlots of them. But if you want a job, you\nneed to learn the latest generation of\nframeworks.\nLike an iphone, frameworks are created in\ngenerations, each generation\nhas more modern features than the\nprevious one. Right now the latest\ngeneration is\nreact, vue, and angular so learn one of\nthese.\nIf you don't know which one to pick, you\ncan do a job search in the location you\nwant to work,\nand learn the framework that comes up\nmost often. To learn a framework you can\ngo to its website and follow their\ngetting started guide.\nAnd that's it! You're on your way to\nbecoming a highly paid web developer.\nI've put the links for these frameworks\nin the description for you to try out,\nand you can check out this video for a\nlittle more detail about frameworks.\nMy name is simon from supersimple.dev\nand my mission is to make a tech career\npossible for\nanyone. If you want to learn tech with me\nplease subscribe for the latest videos\nand\nlessons. Thanks for watching and I'll see\nyou in the next one.\n",
