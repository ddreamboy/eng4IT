  "text": "hello everyone welcome to this\ninteresting video on google cloud\nplatform full course\nin this video we will explore and\nunderstand all the important concepts\nrevolving around google cloud platform\nstarting with the basics of what is gcp\nand its following concepts like gcp\ndomains comprising various services like\ncompute storage networking iot etc\nwith the proper hands-on demonstration\non these services\nfollowing that we will have a comparison\nbetween gcp aws and azure\nand we'll see how they differ from each\nother and how they hold their\nindividuality and then\nat the end we will understand some of\nits depth concepts like gcp web hosting\nand gcp cloud ml\nand towards the end we will take you\nthrough gcp fundamentals and\ncertification training that will help\nyou\ngain this certification\nso for this training with me i have our\nexperience gcp specialist together we\nwill take you through the various\nimportant keynotes of google cloud\nplatform\nso let's start with an exciting video on\ngoogle cloud platform full course\nbefore we begin make sure to subscribe\nto our youtube channel and hit the bell\nicon and never miss an update from\nsimply learn\ngood morning and good evening everyone\nso welcome to this session on google\ncloud platform my name is aj and i'm an\ninstructor with simply learn and also\nworking as a big data and cloud\narchitect for various clients across\nglobe in this session we learn about\ngoogle cloud platform wherein we will\nlearn about what is cloud computing why\ngoogle cloud platform what is gcp that\nis google cloud platform\ngoogle cloud platform domains\nabout a use case that is federal use\ncase and also a quick demo on using\nservices from google cloud platform so\nwhen we talk about google cloud platform\nwe also need to know what is cloud\ncomputing so cloud computing is the use\nof hardware and software components to\ndeliver a service to a network\nusers can access these files and\napplications\nand services provided by a cloud\nprovider\nfrom any device that has access to\ninternet\nin short cloud computing is a way where\ncloud provider provides\naccess to different services such as\nresources and when we talk about\nresources here we talk about computing\nwe talk about memory we talk about\nprocessing power we talk about storage\nand we also talk about different\nservices which cloud providers\nmake available for the users now that\nallows us for automatic software\nintegration\nbackup and restoring data unlimited\nstorage capacity having a reliable use\nof different services\nand\nhaving a cost efficient solution\nnow we know that cloud computing\nmodels there are different service\nmodels so you have platform as a service\nyou have infrastructure as a service and\nyou have software as a service and these\nare the prominent models which are\noffered by different cloud providers\nsuch as google cloud\nsuch as google you have amazon you have\nazure and also some organizations build\ntheir own private clouds using open\nsource openstack\nlet's focus more on google cloud\nplatform and what it has to offer and\nhow it is gaining popularity in the\nmarket with different organizations\nwhich would want to work on a cloud\nplatform or which would want to work\non\nan infrastructure\nwhich is modernized so when we talk\nabout cloud computing this is one of the\napproach which organizations can take to\ninstantaneously benefit from\nmodernization using different services\ndifferent platforms and also newer\ntechnologies\nfor their various requirements such as\nscalability or dynamic businesses\nbefore we get into google cloud platform\nit is also\ngood to understand\nwhere you can find some useful resources\nabout google cloud platform and here you\nhave a website which is\nfrom your google cloud so this is\ncloudacademy.com\nslash library slash google and here you\ncan create a free account now that would\ngive you just seven days trial but that\nhas a lot of\nvideos which talk about your google\ncloud platform and essentials and it has\nvarious certification related videos\nwhich you can access and then after\nseven days after you have tried you can\nobviously go for a paid account where\nyou can take detailed learning from here\nnow this is your training library which\nshows your different cloud providers\nsuch as amazon microsoft seo\ngcp\nand then you have various other topics\nwhich are specifics to organization\nyou can obviously look at the pricing\nand you can also look at resources which\nwill give you a good\nexperience in learning from these videos\nyou can also create a free account which\ni will walk you through later so you can\ncreate a free account on\ncloud.google.com now when i say free\naccount that basically means it allows\nyou to create an account and every user\nwho creates an account gets a 300 free\ncredit which can be used to practice\nbrush up your skills and also explore\nand learn about different\ngoogle cloud products which are offered\nby google\nnow coming back to our google cloud\nplatform let's understand why google\ncloud platform\nso google cloud platform is popular for\nmany reasons now let us see a few of\nmost important reasons why it stands out\nwhen you talk about pricing pricing is\none of the significant factors that make\ngoogle cloud stand out among the other\ncloud providers\nit offers a monthly pricing plan which\nis built according to monthly usage and\nwhen we talk about billing here the\nbilling can be in hours it can be in\nminutes and it can also be in seconds\nthere are different options when you\ntalk about your pricing which can be\nfound from your google cloud web page\nnow pricing could be\nbased on preemptive machines pricing\ncould be based on reserved instances or\nreserved resources i'll show you the\nlink where you can find more details on\npricing part of it\nso\ngoogle cloud really has various pricing\noptions which help customers in their\ndifferent requirements whether they\nwould go for\nany of the service models such as\ninfrastructure as a service platform as\na service or even software as a service\none more attractive thing about google\ncloud pricing is that it provides\ncommitted use discounts\nfor example under this scheme you can\npurchase a specific amount of virtual\ncpu cores and memory for up to 57\npercent discount of\nregular prices if you commit usage for\neither one or three years now this is\njust one option there are various such\noptions which you can learn about from\nthe google cloud's page and that really\nsuits\ndifferent customers for their different\nrequirements\nnow when we talk about speed we don't\nneed to really challenge this aspect\nwhen it comes to google services so\ngoogle provides its google cloud and\ngoogle app customer speed up to 10\nterabytes because of its faster cable\nsystem there are different kind of\nmachines which can be used if you are\ntalking about computation if you are\ntalking about memory hungry applications\nor even storage intensive workloads\nall in all speed is one of the defining\ncharacteristics of google cloud services\nthe cable has connections over u.s west\ncoast\nmain cities in japan and even major hubs\nin asia this speed enhances performances\nand leads to customer satisfaction now\nwhen we talk about customers\nany or every customer would prefer to\nhave low latency\nhigh throughput\nbased services they would want to use\nhigher speeds to process their data in\nas less time as possible google provides\na low latency network infrastructure in\nfact you can say that when you are using\ngoogle cloud services you are using the\nservices from the same infrastructure\nwhich google uses for its popular\nservices such as google search or even\nyoutube which is one of the second\nlargest repository which can be accessed\nfor videos now when we talk about big\ndata\nbig data is data which is\nvery complex has a lot of other\ncharacteristics such as\nyour volume you have velocity you have\nvariety you have veracity validity\nvolatility virality and so on so if an\norganization has is working on big data\ngoogle cloud can be a better choice\nbecause google has many innovative tools\nfor cloud warehousing for example such\nas bigquery and even real-time data\nprocessing tools such as data flow\nbigquery is a data warehouse that allows\nmassive processing of data at high\nspeeds basically working on your\nstructured data google also has launched\nsome new machine learning from\nartificial intelligence tools now there\nare various other services which we can\nwhich we can use from google cloud\nplatform but let's understand what is\ngoogle cloud platform and what are some\nof the services\neven the services which are not listed\nhere can be found in your console from\ngoogle cloud so what is google cloud\nplatform gcp\nit is a set of cloud computing services\nprovided by google that runs on the same\ninfrastructure as i mentioned that\ngoogle uses for its end user products\nlike youtube gmail and even google\nsearch the various set of services\noffered by google cloud platform are so\nyou have services which are specific to\ncomputing requirements and again in\ncomputing you have\nvarious different options available you\nhave machines which are compute\noptimized machines which are memory\noptimized machines which are storage\noptimized and also we have certain\nmachines such as pre m tiff which\nbasically means that you could get a\nmachine\nto work on at a far\nlesser price than any other machine but\nwhen we talk about preemptive these are\nthe machines which can be requested on\ndemand and they can be taken back by\ngoogle at any time you have networking\nrelated services\nwhich can be very useful when you are\nsetting up your applications or your\nservices across globe you also have\ndifferent services which are specific to\nmachine learning\nand organizations which would be\ninterested in working on machine\nlearning or artificial intelligence\nwould be really interested in using\nthese services there are also innovative\nsolutions to work on big data and big\ndata related technologies\nnow when we talk about google cloud\nplatform domains so we can break down\nthese services into specifics such as\nyou have compute\nnow the compute service allows for\ncomputing and hosting\nthe cloud\nnow when you talk about computing here\nthere are different services\nsuch as app engine you have compute\nengine you have kubernetes you have\ncloud functions and cloud run when you\ntalk about storage and database so the\nstorage and database service allows\napplication to store media files backups\nor other file-like objects now various\nservices under this are as follows you\nhave cloud storage cloud sql cloud table\nfor unstructured data you have cloud\nspanner cloud data store persistent\ndisks and cloud memory store when we\ntalk about networking the networking\nservice allows us to load balance\ntraffic across resources now as i\nmentioned earlier resources could be\nyour different resources which you would\nbe using from a cloud platform such as\nyour devices your instances memory\noptimize or cpu optimized instances or\nother resources creating dns records and\nmuch more so various services under this\nare vpc that stands for virtual private\ncloud you have cloud load balancing\ncloud armor cloud cdn you have cloud\ninterconnect dns and network service\ntiers when we talk about the big data\nservice this allows us to process and\nquery big data in cloud now various\nservices under these are as follows you\nhave bigquery cloud cloud data proc\ncloud composer cloud data lab cloud data\nprep cloud pub sub which is published in\nsubscribing system you have cloud data\nstudio now you also have the developer\ntools and developer tools service\nincludes tools related to\ndevelopment of an application now\nvarious services under these are as\nfollows that is you have cloud sdk\nsoftware development kit you have\ndeployment manager cloud source\nrepositories and cloud test lab when we\ntalk about identity and security which\nis one of the primary concerns for any\norganization or any user who would be\ninterested in using a cloud platform\ngoogle cloud really has taken care of\nthis\nso when you talk about identity and\nsecurity domain this deals with security\nservices now various services here\nare cloud identity you have identity and\naccess management that is cloud iam you\nhave identity aware proxies you have\ncloud data loss prevention api security\nkey enforcement key management service\nand many more\nyou also have cloud services which are\nrelated to internet of things so very\nmuch would be used by organizations who\nwould be working on iot devices or the\ndata generated by these devices so\nvarious services here\nare cloud iot core you have edge tpu and\ncloud iot also when we talk about cloud\nai that is artificial intelligence this\ncomprises of services related to machine\nlearning and much more so you have cloud\nauto ml\ncloud tpu cloud machine learning engine\njob discovery\ndialog flow enterprise natural language\ncloud text to speech and much more\nif you would be interested in services\nrelated to api platform then there are\ndifferent services under this category\nor this domain so you have maps platform\nyou have apg api platform monetization\ndeveloper portal analytics that is api\nanalytics apg sense cloud endpoints and\nservice infrastructure\nso these are some of the listing of\nservices under each cloud platform\ndomain\nnow let's look at ferrero use case and\nlet's also understand\nwhat was done here so ferraro is one of\nthe famous chocolate and ranks third\namong worldwide chocolate and\nconfectionary producers it was found in\n1946 in italy i'm sure you would have\nseen the ferrero chocolates when you\nwould have gone out to buy some\nchocolates so the challenges here was\nthat federal as we know is sold in every\nsupermarket and is known for its quality\nonce the business grew some issues arose\nright and that's what happens when the\nbusiness grows you have issues popping\nup which could be related to the volume\nof data the speed with which the data is\ngetting generated the variety of data\nand also looking at your platforms which\nsupport\ndifferent dynamic applications or your\nscalability requirements performance\nrequirements and so on\nso it needed data storage processing and\nanalysis system for a wide customer\ndatabase\nthere was a huge gap between the company\nand the people who bought its goods\nbecause the company relied on data given\nsales outlets now that's one of the\nchallenge\nferro wanted to create a digital\necosystem where there was a point of\ncontact with its customers and also a\nfoundation for an innovative data-driven\nmarketing strategy what was the solution\nhere so one of the service of cloud\nplatforms or google cloud platform is\nbigquery and this was an answer to\nferraro's challenges since it was\ncapable of hyper fast and efficient data\nanalysis as a solution\nnow as i mentioned bigquery is a data\nwarehouse which allows you to store\nstructured data now this could directly\nbe used as a service where you could\nstore in any amount of data\nand you would not be paying for storage\nso there are different pricing models\nand\nfor data\nup to one terabytes you would not be\ncharged anything\nand if you would be accessing the data\nthat is reading the data or processing\nthe data from bigquery that's where the\npricing model kicks in\nnow using google cloud's bigquery\nbusiness analysts of federal were able\nto store and analyze massive data sets\nin a very reliable fast and affordable\nmanner\nconsumer behavior and sales pattern data\nreports were easy to build and automate\nand the analysis also followed federer\nto adopt\nadvertising across various marketing\nchannels to serve the customer needs in\na better way what was the result\nthey could divide their database into\nreal-time actionable consumer clusters\nto generate more accurate user profiles\nferraro was also able to personalize its\nmarketing strategies to match the user\nneeds\nnow google cloud platform completely\ntailored the website mobile content and\nadvertising\nand created a very cost effective media\nby strategy\nnow these were some basics on google\ncloud now as i said you can always find\na lot of details about pricing about\nservices\nand also all the services are accessible\nin your free trial account now let me\njust walk you through here so one is\nyou could always find details on\ndocumentation on each of these services\nso if i would click on getting started\nyou have quick start which basically\nshows you short tutorials\nyou have trainings and you have also\ncertifications now if we click on quick\nstart\nnow that takes me to this page which\nshows me\nquick starts\nor if you would want to understand about\ndifferent projects\nif you would want to\nlook into the documentation of creating\na linux virtual machine or storing a\nfile and sharing it deploying a\ncontainer docker container image and so\non so you have a lot of quick starts\nhere you can also look at cloud minute\non the same page on the right side you\nhave docs and once you click on that it\ntakes you to these links now this shows\nyou build solutions which shows your top\nuse cases best practices all the\nsolutions it's always good to learn from\nthese use cases which are available and\nhere you have different feature products\nand all the different services\nwhich google cloud offers now you can\nclick on featured products\nand that basically shows you a list of\nthese products now here we have all the\nsolutions which you can look at\narchitecture database enterprise level\nbig data and analysis gaming related\ninternet of things and so on now if you\ngo down here it shows you featured\nproducts and that shows you\nsome of the important products such as\ncompute engine which is belonging to the\ncompute domain you have cloud run you\nhave anthers which is for migration\nand basically cloud\nadoption\nwhen organizations would want to move\nfrom on-premise to cloud-based solutions\nyou have vision ai you have cloud\nstorage now that basically allows you to\nstore any kind of data whether that's an\nobject so this is acting as an object\nstorage you have cloud sql which is\nbasically a ready-to-use\nservice where you would be using mysql\npostgres or any other sql server\ndatabase services you have bigquery\nwhich is a data warehouse which\nbasically allows you to store your\nstructured data\nand then you have your ai and machine\nlearning related products so you have\nauto ml vision ai video ai text to\nspeech space to text and so on\nnow you also have different platform\naccelerators which can be used and in\nany of these cases for example if i\nwould click on compute engine which is a\nfeatured product from google cloud now\nthat shows you\nbasically your quick starts\nusing your linux machines how to guides\nwhich tells you completely working on a\nvm instance\nor working on storage working on\npersistent disks and so on and it shows\nyou the documentation here now you also\nhave products and pricing option\nwhich you can see for gcp pricing and\nyou could straight away go to the\npricing you could be looking at\nsolutions which talks about\ninfrastructure modernization now this is\nsomething which organizations are\ninterested in when they would want to\nmove from their on-premise solution to\nyour google cloud now here i can say for\nexample i click on infrastructure\nmodernization you can always find some\ncase studies what are the different\nsolutions we have here right when you\ntalk about google cloud so you can\nalways click on see solutions and you\ncan look at vm migration or sap cloud\nright by google cloud what it can be\nused for vmware as a service or hpc that\nis high performance computing and about\nthese services we will learn in detail\nlater\nnow i can go back on the same page where\ni was clicking on the services so you\nhave quick starts you have how to guides\nyou have deep understanding of different\nconcepts\nright and here\nif i click on all how to guides so that\nshows me what are the different ways in\nwhich you can work with compute engine\nand working with different instances\nalthough it's quite exhaustive content\nbut then if you follow steadily then you\ncan learn a lot about google cloud\nnow here i can just go back\nso this is just giving you some idea on\nthe different products which are\navailable from google cloud\nlooking into different sections finding\nright documentation here right and you\ncan always look into each one of these\nin detail for each product which google\ncloud offers\nnow\nif we scroll down we could see all the\noptions or all the domains which we see\nhere right let me just go back because\nwe got into solutions now we have quick\nstarts right\nand then you can basically scroll all\nthe way down to look at cloud sdk which\ncan be set up on your windows machine\nlike i have set it up on my windows\nmachine\nplus when you use google console you\nhave a gui which i'll show you in a\ncouple of minutes and also a cloud shell\nwhere you can use\nyour command line options to work with\ngoogle cloud platform you have cloud\nconsole which is nothing but your gui to\naccess your resources\nnow you can also look at in-depth\ntutorials pricing and you have different\nother options so let's just click on\npricing here and then we have\nyour price list which basically gives\nyou details of different services what\nare available\nand what are the services or what are\nthe prices so for example if i click on\ncompute engine right and this shows me\nthe pricing aspect of compute engine\nwhich belongs to compute domain and here\nyou can see you have vm instance pricing\nyou have networking pricing sole tenant\nnodes which are specific to particular\norganizations\nor if organizations would want to have\ndedicated nodes you have gpu based\npricing right so general processing\nunits you have disk and image pricing\nand you can click on any of the links\nand you can see pricing which also shows\nyou your different kind of machine types\nso here you have different kind of\nmachine types which says n1 n2 n2d e2\nyou have memory optimized machine types\nyou have compute optimized you have\npremium images\nand you can basically look at all the\ncategories you can look at disk pricing\nwhich involves your persistent disk\npricing for ssds or sdds what are the\nkind of images what are the different\nnetwork services right and you can\nalways look at\nyour machine types you can choose a\nparticular region right there is the\nconcept of region and availability zones\nhere and as per region you could look at\nthe prices\nyou can also look at standard prices you\ncould be looking for what are the free\ntier machines if i'm specifically\nlooking for vm instance pricing i can\nclick on this one and that takes me to\nthe vm instance pricing what is the\nbilling module what is the instance\nuptime what is the resource-based\npricing and then you can also look at\ndifferent kind of discounts such as\nsustained use discounts committed use\ndiscounts discounts for preemptable vm\ninstances and so on and this is how you\ncan be looking at pricing for all\ndifferent resources and you can choose\nthe resource which you are interested in\nand then look for the pricing benchmarks\nreservations if you would want to use\nand you would want to benefit if you\nwould want to look at what are the\nquotas and limits and so on so please\nexplore this link and you can find a lot\nof information when it comes to\ntechnical options looking at different\ngoogle cloud products which we briefly\ndiscussed when it comes to domains\nand what each product can be used for\nyou can always come back to the main\npage where i was showing you different\nservices we went into pricing straight\naway right now you can always come back\nto this page\non\nyourcloud.google.com and then you have\nyour solutions\nwhich talks about different products\nright and you can click on these or you\ncan look into technical documentation so\nthis talks about your different featured\nsolutions infrastructure solutions you\nhave data center migration related and\nso on so i could be talking more and\nmore about google cloud platform it's a\nocean it's a huge\nchunk of different services for\ndifferent organizational requirements so\nlook into this link and also what you\ncan do is create a account on gmail i\nmean you could create a free account or\nyou could go to cloud.google.com\nand then you could create a free account\nlike i have created here and i can just\nclick on console now that's my gui or\ngoogle cloud console which basically\nallows me to work with google cloud now\nthere are a lot of options here by\ndefault when you create an account now\nin my case on the top it says it's a\nfree trial account i have 300 credit and\nout of that 251 dollars is left and 237\ndays out of a year are left for my\naccount now here i can basically see the\nproject right and by default we can\ncreate a project or by default there is\na project existing for any user so when\nyou log in it creates a particular\nproject and you could create a new\nproject and project would be to dedicate\nyour different services or different\nresources per different project so this\nis your dashboard which basically shows\nyour project which shows you a project\nnumber and a project id which is always\nunique now you can click on this and\nthis if you would want you can hide this\ninformation you can also look into the\ndocumentation part of it then it shows\nyou the different services or a\ngraphical information of services which\nyou might have used in past\nso you have compute engine which shows\nyou how much percentage of cpu was used\nyou can always go to compute engine as a\nservice you can look at your google\nroute platform status and look at the\ngoogle cloud status now this is billing\nnow since this shows me the billing\nperiod for april month and i can always\nlook at detailed charges i can look at\nreporting i can look at different apis\nwhich google offers\nand\nfor your different kind of work you can\nalways go to the api overview or the api\nlink and enable or disable any api now\nonce you enable or disable any api then\nyou can use that so you have new section\nyou have documentation and you have\ngetting started guides which tells you\nhow to work or enable different apis if\nyou would want to deploy a pre-built\nsolution add dynamic logging monitoring\nerrors deploying a hello world app and\nso on now this is your dashboard i can\nclick on activity and that would show me\nwhat kind of activity i would have done\nin my cloud platform i can always choose\nthe kind of activities\nby saying activity type i can choose the\nresources now it shows me that i created\nsome vm instances i deleted them i\nupdated some metadata i basically worked\non instances i changed some firewall\nrules here i have then also worked on\nsome other services or apis so i created\nsome buckets which is for object storage\nand again i have been working with some\ninstances and creating some firewall\nrules\nhere i have granted some permissions i\nam setting up a policy right so this\nactivity gives me a history of what\nthings i have done over the past couple\nof months while working on google cloud\nplatform now\non the top left corner you have the\nhamburger menu which you can click on\nthis so that's your navigation menu and\nwhen you click on this this shows you\nhome it takes you to the marketplace it\nspecifically takes you to billing you\ncan always look at apis and services so\nhere in api services i can pretty much\ngo to a dashboard and i can see a report\non the traffic or errors or latency\nand the kind of apis which are available\nso you have compute engine api you have\nbigquery api bigquery data transfer api\nbigquery storage cloud data proc so\nthese are some of the apis or services\ni've used in past might be i was\nevaluating a product might be i was\nusing a particular product so you have\nwhenever you would want to use a\nparticular service from google cloud\nplatform you would be enabling these\napis so here we see some apis for data\nproc you have\nlogging monitoring you have resource\nmanager api you have cloud sql which\nallows you to directly use mysql or\npostgres you have cloud storage right\nand so many apis so if i would want to\nenable a particular api which is not\nright now required but then it's good to\nknow you can always click on this one\nyou can search for an api so for example\nif i would say data proc right and that\nshows me the cloud data proc api which\nmanages hadoop based clusters and jobs\non google cloud platform so i can spin\nup a hadoop cluster and i can start\nrunning some jobs on a hadoop cluster on\ndemand and as i am done with it i can\njust get rid of it so this is an api\nwhich i would have to enable\nand then for every particular service\nyou also have an admin api which you\nwould enable\nnow going back so coming out from this\napi library i got into api and services\nnow there is\nyou can look into the library you can\nlook at credentials and you can also\nlook at\ndifferent time intervals for which you\ncan see the usage of your different apis\nnow going back to the menu you have\nsupport\nwherein you can always reach out to the\ngoogle support team if you are\nusing a paid version even with free\ntrial you can try to reach out and you\nwill find someone to help but it is\nalways good when you have a billing\ncycle reaching out the customer care you\nhave identity access management in admin\nand this is required when you're working\nwith different apis or services\nwhen you would want to have relevant\naccess you have getting started you have\nsecurity related options you have anthos\nwhich is mainly for migration now here\nyou can look at your different domains\nsuch as which we discussed so you have\ncompute and in compute you have\ndifferent services so you have app\nengine you have compute engine\nkubernetes you have cloud functions and\ncloud run you can look into the storage\naspect which shows you bit table which\nis usually and mainly for your\nunstructured data\nbig table which is something which gave\nrise to popular nosql databases like\nhbase and cassandra you have data store\nwhich can be used you have firestore\nfile store storage which can be used to\nput in data of any kinds you have sql\nfor structured data you have spanner as\na service you have memory store and you\nhave data transfer\nnow when it comes to the networking\ndomain you have all these services such\nas vpc virtual private network network\nrelated services for your load balancing\nfor using a cloud-based dns or cloud\ndefined network you have hybrid\nconnectivity network service to yes\nsecurity and intelligence\nthen you have other options for your\noperations which can be used and here\nyou have different other tools which can\nbe used such as cloud build you have\ncloud tasks container registry\ndeployment manager and many more\nbig data specific you have the services\nhere so you have data proc which can be\nused to spin up your clusters you have\npublished subscribe messaging system\nsuch as now kafka which you might have\nheard of originates its idea from here\nso pub sub you have data flow you have\niot core bigquery which is a data\nwarehouse package or data warehousing\nsolution from google cloud\nnow then you have your artificial\nintelligence related services another\nother google solutions\nso you can always find a huge list of\nservices or you can say at high level\nsolutions offered by google cloud\nand we can use these to basically test\nsome of the solutions use them and work\non them so i'll give you a quick demo on\ndifferent services which can be used\nhere from your google cloud platform now\nthis is your google cloud platform and\nthis is your console now this also gives\nyou a cloud shell which can be activated\nso that you can work from command line\nand you can always find a lot of\ndocumentation on that so you can also\nset up your cloud shell that is sdk on\nyour windows machine and if you have set\nit up then basically you could be doing\nsomething like gcloud right if the cloud\nhas been set up so in my case\ni had set up the cloud sdk and basically\ni can get into that\nby looking at what path i have set up so\ncloud sdk and then i can be using it\nfrom my windows machine as per my\ncomfort i can also activate the cloud\nshell here which will basically open up\na terminal and at any point of time you\ncan open up this one cloud shell in a\ndifferent window it is preparing the\ncloud shell where it will by default set\nup your project it will set up the\nmetadata and now i am logged into my\ngoogle cloud account from command line\nand here i can basically use gcloud\nright and that basically shows you the\ndifferent options which are available\nwhich you can be using so if you would\nwant to use a particular service you can\nalso try giving a help and that shows\nyou how do you manage your google cloud\nplatform right so you have different\noptions for billing to work with your\ndifferent services\nand basically you could be working on\ngoogle cloud using this cloud shell from\nyour command line\nusually for people who are learning\ngoogle cloud in the beginning it is\nalways good to go for console and use\nyour different services from here in an\neasier way but as i said you can always\nuse the command line for example if i\nwould just go ahead and type gcloud\ncreate\ninstances\nand that will directly take me to the\ncloud console documentation which shows\nyou different options which you can use\nto work with instances so i could do a\ngcloud compute instances create and then\ni can give my instance name and so on\nand i'll show you some examples on that\nso you can be using your cloud console\nright that is your cloud shell and you\ncan straight away start working from\ncommand line however i would suggest\nusing console in the beginning and when\nyou are well experienced then you can\nstart using cloud shell to do things\nfrom command line and when you are fully\nexperienced you can always switch and\ncertain things are usually useful or\neasier when done from command line and\nsome are easier when you do it from the\nconsole and you can use any one of these\noptions now we can go to google cloud\nconsole now as of now i can close this\none i still have my cloud shell open if\ni would want to look into it i can click\non this one and i can straight away go\nto compute engine where i would want to\nwork on creating some instances on\ngoogle cloud platform using the compute\nengine service and then basically\nconnecting to those instances and\nbasically trying out some basic things\nso you can click on vm instances\nand then once this comes up i can always\ncreate some instances now if you see\nhere i have some instances already\ncreated right and i can continue working\non those i can create new instances i\ncan use different options while creating\ninstances and i'll show you that in a\ndemo in quick seconds\nso let's have a quick demo on setting up\ngcp instances now before that let's have\na quick recap so when you talk about\ninstance or a virtual machine it is\nhosted on google's infrastructure right\nand you can create your google cloud\ninstance using this google cloud console\nthat is by clicking on this and then\ngoing to compute engine and clicking on\nvm instances now you can also do that\nfrom google cloud command line tool that\nis cloud shell and you can be doing that\nusing compute engine api\nso compute engine instances can run the\npublic images for linux or windows\nservers\nthat google provides you also have\noption of creating or using custom\nimages that you can create and import\nfrom your existing systems you can\ndeploy docker containers which are\nautomatically launched on instance\nrunning containers optimized os\nnow when you talk about instances and\nprojects always remember that in each\ninstance belongs to a google cloud\nconsole project and a project can have\none or more instances\nwhen you talk about instances and\nstorage options each instance has a\nsmall boot persistent disk which i will\nshow you in further screens\nthat contains the os you can add more\nstorage space if needed\nand when you talk about instances and\nnetwork a project can have up to five\nvpc networks so vpc network is virtual\nprivate networks wherein you can virtual\nprivate cloud networks where you can\nhave your resources within your own\nsubnet\nand each instance belongs to one vpc\nnetwork\nnow instances in same network can\ncommunicate with each other through\nlocal area network protocol an instance\nuses internet to communicate within any\nmachine so that could be virtual\nphysical or outside its own network when\nyou talk about instances and containers\nyou should remember that compute engine\ninstances support a declarative method\nfor launching your application using\ncontainers now you can create a vm\ninstance or a vm instance template\nyou can provide a docker image and\nlaunch the configuration\nso there are different ways in which you\ncan create these instances and once you\ncreate these instances you can say for\nexample you are creating a linux\ninstance you can associate ssh keys with\nyour google account or your g suite\naccount and then manage your admin\nnon-admin access to the instance using\nim roles if you connect to your instance\nusing gcloud or ssh from console which\nwe will see later compute engine can\ngenerate ssh keys for you and apply that\nto your google cloud or g suite account\nnow what we can do is we can see how we\ncan create your google cloud instances\nfrom your console or from the command\nline let's have a look in creating\ninstances\nusing gcp console now that we have\nlearned on some basics of google cloud\nplatform what are the different services\nwhat are different domains basically\nlooking at your google cloud console or\neven cloud shell\nlet's go ahead and create some vm\ninstances now that's from your compute\nengine service and let's try connecting\nto these instances and see how this\nworks let's also see what are the\ndifferent options which are available\nwhen you would want to create the\nvirtual machine instances here so when\nyou click on your drop down from the top\nleft and choose compute engine so it\nbrings you to this page so i can show\nthat again so you can click on compute\nengine click on vm instances and that\nbasically brings you to this page now\nhere it tells you compute engine lets\nyou use virtual machines that run on\ngoogle's infrastructure so we can create\nmicro vms or large instances running\ndifferent distributions of linux or\nwindows using standard images that is\npublic images and you can also have your\nown image so let's create a vm instance\nby clicking on create\nnow that's basically helping me to\ncreate an instance here so it shows me\nthe instance name i can give it\nsomething so let me say c1\nnow i can add labels so what is label it\nbasically allows you to organize your\nproject add arbitrary labels as key\nvalue pairs to your resources this so\nthis is basically categorizing your\nlabels and projects if you have multiple\nprojects now remember if you have your\ncloud console and if you have created\nyour free trial account it will allow\nyou to do these things if not you may\nhave to go back to the billing section\nand see if the billing is enabled which\nalso means that when you are creating\nyour google cloud account it will ask\nyou to key in your credit card details\nbut they do not charge anything or they\nmight charge might be one dollar or one\nrupee depending on your location and\nthat's also refunded but that's just to\nverify your card now once i've given the\nname i can choose a region so i would\nbasically choose europe since i'm in\neurope i would be clicking on europe\nwest 3 and here i can choose an\navailability zone availability zone is\nbasically to make your services\nor instances or any other resources\nhighly available\nso you can choose one of the\navailability zones now i would choose\nsave s3\nnow this one we can scroll down and here\nit says machine configurations you have\ngeneral purpose machines you have memory\noptimized machines which is m1 series\nand you can always go back to the google\ncloud page and see\nwhat a particular kind of machine\nspecializes in so i would click on\ngeneral purpose and in general purpose\nyou have different categories so you\nhave n1 which is powered by intel\nskylake cpu platform or you have e2\nwhich is cpu platform selected selection\nbased on availability so let's have n1\nselected now this one shows me the\nmachine type and if you are using your\nfree tier account then you can start\nwith correcting a micro machine which is\none virtual cpu core you can go for a g1\nsmall which is one virtual cpu core and\n1.7 gb ram you can even go up to a high\nend machine and then\nyou can basically see if you are using a\nfree account how many of these machines\nyou can use if i would be selecting\neight virtual cpu cores and 32 gigabyte\nof memory then it would allow me to\ncreate at least two instances by this\nconfiguration we will use n1 standard\nwhich is one virtual cpu core 3.75 gb\nmemory now then we can also deploy a\ncontainer image to this vm instance if\nyou would be interested in deploying a\ncontainer image let's not get into that\nright now\nhere it shows you the boot disk and it\nshows you dbn gnu 9 linux 9. what i\nwould do is i can go for this\ndistribution or i can choose a linux\ndistribution of my choice so here you\nhave public images you have custom\nimages you also have snapshots if you\nhave created backup of your previous\nimages\nhere i can choose for example ubuntu and\nthen i can choose a particular version\nso let's go for ubuntu 18.04 you can go\nfor the latest one also 18.04 would be\ngood enough\nand here it tells me what is the boot\ndisk so you have ssds or you have\nstandard persistent disks now ssds are a\nlittle expensive in comparison to your\nstandard persistent disks or your sdds\nbut then ssds are faster so as of now we\ncan choose standard persistent disk as\nit is and we can let the gigabyte be 10\nnow depending on your requirement you\ncan increase this you can even add disks\nlater that's not a problem click on\nselect now here i have access scopes so\nhere i will say allow default access you\ncan also set access for each api\nor you can give full access to all cloud\napis so that based on your requirement\nyou can any time change later also we\nwill also say allow http traffic and we\ncan also choose allow https traffic that\nbasically allows me to access this\nmachine or services which are http based\naccessible from this machine now i can\njust click on create however it would be\ngood to basically enable connectivity to\nthis machine now we can do that in\ndifferent ways one is when you bring up\nyour machine\nit will have an ssh access which you can\nlog in from the cloud platform here\nitself or what you can do is you can\ncreate a private and a public key\nusing some softwares like putty or putty\ngen so for example if you do not have\nthat on your machine\nyou can download you can just type in\ndownload putty that takes you to the\nputty.org page and here you can click on\ndownload putty and scroll down which\nshows you for your 64-bit machine which\ni have in my case you can download\nputty.exe which is basically your ssh\nand telnet client to connect to your\nmachines you can also use puttygen which\nwill be allowing you to create a private\nand a public key\nwhich i have done in my case let me show\nyou how so what you can do is you can go\nto puttygen to begin with and here you\ncan click on generate now then to have\nthis key generated just move your cursor\non the top here in the empty space and\nthat creates your key you can give it a\nname so for example let's give a user\nname i would give\nhdu now i can give a password for this\none so let me give a simple password\nand what i can also do is i can copy\nthis public key from here and for my\nlater usage i can just keep it in my\nnotepad file which i can use later and\ni'll show you when\nso now we can save this private key and\nthis will basically allow me to save my\nprivate key i can choose desktop and i\ncan give it a name so let's say\nnew key new key and that will be getting\nsaved in a dot ppk file so let's save it\nand that's done so we also have our\npublic key and we have saved our private\nkey now we know that when you would want\nto connect using ssh you need your\nprivate keys to the client and public\nkey also has to be existing so let's\ntake this public key so let's do a\ncontrol a i'm going to copy this and i'm\ngoing to come back to my google cloud\nconsole and here you can click on\nsecurity so you can click on the\nsecurity tab here\nscroll down and just give your public\nkey once you give that it resolves and\nshows you the name and this is good\nenough so that i can use my ssh client\nto connect to this machine i can click\non create and this will basically create\nmy vm instance it will take some time\nand then your instance will have an\ninternal ip which will show up here\nexternal ip and it will also show you\noptions to connect to these machines so\nthis is my internal ip this is my\nexternal ip which i can use to connect\nfrom a client i can easily connect from\nthe option here which says ssh and i can\nsay open in a browser window i can even\nopen this in a custom port i can look at\nthe gcloud command which you can give\nfrom cloud shell or you can use another\nssh so let's first do a open in browser\nwindow and let's see if this connects so\nwe can easily connect to our instance in\nthe ubuntu 18 instance which i just set\nup here easily in couple of seconds now\nthis is trying to establish a connection\nusing your ssh keys\nand when you do that it also basically\nbrings up this web browser so i'm\nalready connected it shows my username\nwhich is my cloud account username and i\nhave been connected to this machine here\nusing ssh it did not ask me for any\npassword and basically now i can just\ncheck what do i have in my linux file\nsystem right and i can anytime login as\nroot by doing a sudo su for example\nlet's try installing a package and i can\nsay apt get installed vim\nor apt get installed wget\nor apt-get install open ssh and all\nthese packages are already existing so\nnot an issue now i can start using this\ninstance i can just look at the disk\nwhat is available okay now we gave\naround 10 gigabyte out of which we see\n8.3 gigabyte here\nfor the dev sda1 and then 1.8 gigabyte\navailable and you can continue using\nthis machine this was the easiest way of\nconnecting to a vm instance using ssh\nnow what we can also do is i can just\nleave this and i will now try to connect\nusing an external ssh client right and\nhere you can copy the public ip so when\nyou want to connect to an instance you\nwill have to get the public ip also\nremember that if you select and stop\nthis machine which will stop your\nbilling counter and if you start it\nagain the internal ip will remain same\nbut the external ip is the one which\nwill change\ni can obviously select this machine\nanytime and i can do a clean up and i\ncan delete it\ni can do a start of the machine if it is\nstopped and i can even import the\nvirtual machine to be used later so\nthere are different options which you\ncan always use\nso this is my instance and if you would\nwant to look at the details click on\nthis one c1 and that should basically\nallow you to look at the details so it\nshows you what is the instance id what\nis the machine type is it reservation\nspecific what is the cpu platform what's\nthe zone and all the other details\nat any point of time if you would want\nto edit you can always click on edit and\nyou can change the details as you need\nnow you can also look at the equivalent\nrest command to basically use the rest\napi to connect to this instance for now\ni have copied the public ip and i would\nwant to connect it using putty so let's\ngo in here and let's give it the host\nname so i can give ubuntu i can give my\nip address so that's in my session now i\nwill click on ssh i would go into\nauthentication i'll click on browse and\nthis is where i need to choose the ppk\nfile so this is the one which we created\nnew key let's select this\nand then i can come back to session i\ncan even save this and i can call it as\nmy instance one\nlet's save it and you can create any\nnumber of instances so you see i have\ncreated different instances here for my\ngoogle cloud or amazon related instances\nand i can click on open it says the\nservice host key is not cached in the\nregistry that's fine just click on yes\nand basically it says\nno authentication method supported now\nthis could be because we have not\nenabled your ssh access so let's look at\nthat so now let's see if we were trying\nto connect using putty what was the\nissue here so if i go back to my\nputty select my instance load it it says\nport 22 i'm giving the username which is\nwindow or sorry that's the wrong\nusername we gave and that might be the\nreason we had set up the user as sdu so\nlet's save this again and now let's try\nconnecting to this one and it asks for\nmy password and you are able to connect\nthis right now if there was any other\nissue related to network connectivity\nthen we could look at the rules the\ninbound and outbound rules which allow\nus to look into the machine now we are\nconnected to our machine here using hdu\nuser i can log in as root and i can\ncontinue working\nso not only from the ssh within the\ncloud console but you can use an\nexternal ssh client and connect to your\nmachine so this is your ubuntu machine\nand we can basically look at the space\nand that basically confirms we are\nconnecting to the same machine which\nshows 8.3 gigabytes here and 1.8\ngigabytes here which we were seeing from\nthe ssh in the browser now let's close\nthis and let's go back to our instance\npage now here you can always look at the\nnetwork details and this will show you\nyour different kind of rules that is\ningress or egress rules which basically\nallows to connect to this machine from\nan external network\nor for this machine to connect to an\nexternal network so here we have\ndifferent firewall rules which shows\ndefault allow http that's your ingress\nrule and it tells you apply to all it\nshows me what are the ip ranges where i\ncan specifically give the ip of my\nmachine it shows the protocols it shows\nwhat are the different ports which you\nhave used for these services for example\nrtp or ssh which shows 22 you have icmp\nhttp and https now anytime if you would\nwant to make a change to these rules\nthat can be done by going into your\nnetwork details and say for example you\nwould want to work on firewall rules so\nwe have these\nfirewall rules here you can click on\nthis one so right now we are looking\ninto the network domain and we are\nlooking into vpc network right and this\nshows me what are the different rules we\nhave now if i would want to create a\ndifferent firewall rule for a different\nprotocol\ni can always click on create firewall\nrule i can give it a name okay i can say\nwhat if you would want to turn on the\nfirewall logs you can basically say what\nis the kind of traffic so ingress\napplies to incoming traffic and egress\napplies to outgoing traffic and you can\nthen basically choose what are the ip\nranges from where you want that\nconnection to be coming in or to going\nout you can choose a particular protocol\nyou can give a protocol\nhere with comma separated values and you\ncan create a firewall rule so this might\nbe required depending on the services\nwhich you are running wherein you might\nwant to enable your access to your\nmachine from an external service or to\nan external service so you can always go\nto network details from here you can\nthen go into firewall rules create a\nfirewall rule apply that to your\ninstance and restart your instance so as\nof now we don't need to create any\nnetwork details here because my ingress\nor egress rules are already available\nright now i can basically then have my\ninstance stopped and removed so i can\njust do a stop or since this is running\nthe ideal wave would be to do a stop i\ncould also do a reset now what does\nreset do reset does not basically delete\nthe machine what it does is it does a\ncleanup of the machine and it brings it\nto the initial state so sometimes we\nmight have installed\ncertain things on our machine we would\nwant to clean them up and at that time\nreset can be useful\ni can basically click on delete right\nand i can select this and i can do a\ncleanup and this is good always when you\nare using a free trial account try to\nuse different services play around with\nthem and then you can clean up so that\nyou do not waste your free billing\ncredit right and you can use it for\nmeaningful stuff\nnow i have clicked on delete and within\nfew seconds my instance which i had\ncreated will be deleted also to remember\nis if you are creating multiple\ninstances\nthen you can connect from one machine to\nother machine using ssh by using the\nprivate file so for that we can learn in\ndetail later so this is just a simple\nexample of using your compute engine\ncreating your instances connecting to it\nfrom an internal ssh or from an external\nssh client such as putty where you have\nalready created your private and public\nkeys\nnow i can click on the browser here and\nthen i can basically come out and i can\nbasically be looking into any particular\nservice so we just looked into compute\nengine right you have different other\noptions you have instance groups you\nhave instance templates for example\nlet's click on instance templates here\nand that basically shows you that you\ndon't have any instance template and\nthis basically facilitates say for\nexample you are working as a admin and\nyou would want to create an instance\ntemplate so that using that you can\ndescribe a vm instance and then you can\nbasically use this template to create\ndifferent instances\nyou can go for sultan and nodes you can\nlook for machine images you can also\nlook at your disks you can create a\nsnapshots and you can look at different\noptions here now let's come back here\nand let's click on home and that should\ntake you back to your home page which\nbasically shows you if a particular api\nwhich you have used recently which shows\nme in the graph here so i can go to the\napi's overview right and that basically\nshows me if there were any errors if i\nwas using the compute engine api to\nbasically create a vm instance and\nthat's why we were seeing some spike in\nthe graph\nso this is a quick demo of using your\ncompute engine service provided by\ngoogle cloud wherein you can create vm\ninstances and use those vf instances for\nyour application installation\nfor any other purpose\nnow that we have seen how you use your\ncloud console to create an instance and\nalso clean it up\nlet's also understand how you can do\nusing your command line options and\nlet's see what it takes or what are the\ndifferent commands which you can use to\ncreate your instances\nnow you can always when when you are\ncreating an instance you can use compute\nengine which provisions resources to\nstart the instance so instance basically\nhas different states which we can see\nwhen we are creating the instance so you\nbasically start the instance instance\nmoves into staging that is prepared for\nyour first boot\nfinally it boots up and then it moves\ninto running so when you look at instant\nstates which we will create instance and\nsee it will basically have different\nstates such as provisioning where\nresources are being allocated for\ninstance but instance is not yet running\nthen it goes into staging where\nresources have been acquired an instance\nis being prepared for your first boot\nthen instance\nis booting up and running and if you are\nstopping an instance it goes into being\nstop status and it would be moved to the\nterminated option you can also do a\nrepairing of instance and finally you\ncan terminate your instance or clean it\nup by stopping and then deleting it\nnow when you say stopping and resetting\nan instance you can stop the instance as\ni showed earlier if you no longer need\nit but if you need for future use you\ncan just use the reset option which will\nbasically wipe the contents of instance\nor any application state and then\nfinally you can stop it and have it\nterminated now when you would want to do\nthat using your cloud console or we have\nseen the options now let's also see from\nthe command line tool how you can do it\nso here i have the cloud shell which i\nbrought up from here and i basically\nopened it in a new window so command\nline tool enables you to easily manage\nyour compute engine resources in a\nfriendlier format than using your\ncompute engine api now gcloud which is\npart of cloud sdk is the main command\nhere and then you can always auto\ncomplete the different options here so\nwhen you would want to create or work on\ng cloud you can just type in gcloud here\nand then for example i could just say\nhelp to see different options of g cloud\nwhich will show me different options\nwhich you can use here now we would be\ninterested in compute instances so i\ncould also do a g cloud\ncompute\ncompute\ninstances and then i can basically say\ncreate and then i can do a help now that\nshould show me different options which\nwork with gcloud compute instances\ncreate command which is expecting an\ninstance name\nso your google cloud sdk\nwhich we can set up on our windows\nmachine or even on your linux machine\nis set of tools that\nhelps you to manage resources and\napplications hosted on your gcp that is\nyour google cloud platform now here you\nhave options such as gcloud which i'm\nshowing you right now you have gsutil\nand then you have bq so that also can be\nused so you can set up a google cloud\ncompute if using gcloud\nnow what we can do is\nif we are setting up our sdk on our\nwindows machine then we would have to do\na gcloud init which basically in\ninit command because it's already\ninitialized now you can always look at\nyour default zone you can look at your\nregion what is being used all those\nthings are coming from the metadata\nwhich is being used so for example i\ncould be looking at the metadata for my\nparticular project by just doing a g\ncloud and then i can say compute\nand i would be interested in project\ninfo\nso i can just do a project minus info\nand then i can do a describe\nand then i need my project id so i can\nsay minus minus project and i can get my\nproject id from here so you can click on\nthis one and that's my project id so i\ncan click on this one\nand here i can just do a right click and\nif it does not paste then you can do a\nctrl v\nand then i can try to look at my project\ninfo so this basically will give me the\nmetadata which is by default set\nand we can always look at what are the\nregions or what is the zone which has\nbeen set\nso if it has been set so i'm looking at\nmy details it is showing me my ssh keys\nand then it can be using your default\nregion and your default available zones\nit also shows my username and other\ndetails so this is basically to look at\nthe metadata which is available now at\nany point of time i can basically say\nadd metadata i can basically choose\nmetadata option and i can say my default\nregion should be europe which i was\nchoosing earlier so i can just bring up\nthis command again and what i can do is\ni can say here where i have gcloud\ncompute project info where i did it\ndescribed earlier now what i could also\ndo is i can just say add metadata\nand then i can specify what is the\nmetadata i would be interested in adding\ni can then say google compute\ndefault\nregion\nand then i can basically give a region\nfor example europe and then i can say\nwest 3\nand if you are not well experienced you\ncan always do it from console or you can\nbe doing it from here so i am giving\ngoogle cloud compute google compute\ndefault region then i can also give a\ngoogle compute default zone\nand then i can pass in a value for\ndefault zone so i can say europe\nwest 3\nand then basically i can give an\navailability zone so if\nit is basically giving me some error\nwhere i'm trying to pass in these values\nso i can just give it this way and then\nit basically says that if you can look\ninto particular help to see what is the\ncommand which you would have to do now i\ncan basically do a g cloud\ninit here initial configuration and this\nbasically says that it is initializing\nmy\ndefault configuration it says\nreinitialize this configuration from\ncloud shell\nyou want to create a new configuration\nso if i had updated my\nmetadata then basically i could just do\na cloud init\nand i could be\nre-initializing my default configuration\nor properties which i have passed in so\nas of now i will not activate or change\nthe default region let's go for a simple\nway in which you can create your compute\nengine so for example i'll just say one\nand it is re-initializing it asks me\nwhat is the user name\nand let's select that it says what is\nthe project\nand let's select that\nand do you want to configure a default\ncompute region and zone right and i will\njust say yes\nand basically then it shows me different\noptions which we have here\nso there are too many options here and\nthen here we were interested in\neurope west 3 so let's choose 21\nright and then that basically allows me\nto choose my region and my zone so it\nalso gives you some specification so it\nsays your project default compute zone\nhas been set to europe s3 a you can\nchange it by running gcloud config set\nand you can give a compute zone right so\ni can always give these commands i can\nget help information here so i can just\nsay gcloud config set\nand i can be specifying the compute zone\nso i can say compute slash zone and i\ncan give a zone i can say compute slash\nregion and i can give a region name if i\nwould want to do it or the easier way is\nlike what i did right now so you can\nbasically do a command gcloud in it and\nthen basically it allows you to change\nyour configuration or set\ndefault things here you can all the\ntimes you can say gcloud config unset\nto basically remove a compute zone or a\ncompute region now there are different\nways so if you were working on a linux\nmachine you could always\nuse an export command something like\nthis so you could do export compute\nsorry cloud\nsdk\nand then you can say compute underscore\nzone\nand then give your zone name or compute\nunderscore region and give your region\nor you could add it in your bash rc file\nright now that is when you have your\ncloud sdk setup on your linux machine or\non windows machine and you would want to\nspecifically set a zone and a region for\nall your compute related resources so we\ndon't need to do that the default\nsettings are already given here right\nand what we can do is we can start by\nquickly looking into\ngcloud compute instances options so i\ncan say gcloud compute\ninstances\nand then i can just do a list at any\npoint of time if you would need help you\ncan just do a g cloud compute and then\nsay minus minus help or i could just do\na gcloud compute and that shows me\ndifferent options which i have here from\nwhich i use instances\ni can always type instances and again\nhit enter and it shows me different\noptions what you would want to do so i\ncan initially just type list which\nshould show me what are the list\nor what are the instances available and\nas of now we don't have any instances i\ncan always do a list and then i can\nspecify minus minus format and then try\nto get the information in a json format\nor ml or minus minus format text\nso you can always do a list you can do a\nfilter so there are different options\nwith your list and you can you can try\ndoing a help here and that basically\nshows you what are the options so for\nexample if i do a help and it shows me\nwith list what are the things you can do\nso you can give a name you can give a\nregular expression you can say in\nparticular zone you can use a minus\nfilter so there are different commands\nwhich are available and you can always\nfind all those options here as i showed\nyou earlier so now what we would be\ninterested in is basically going for\nyour compute instances i can always do a\nssh and i can create an instance\ni can add and remove metadata right for\nmy instances\nby giving a particular zone by giving a\nparticular region\nand if you would want to do that now\nhere what we can do is we can basically\ncreate an instance by just giving a name\nto that particular instance\nand we can then go back to our console\nand see what has it done so i can say\nhere create so that's an option let's\nsee what does the create do so it says\nokay you are giving a create option but\nyou would have to give a name\nso let's say let's call it e1 and that\nwill be the name of my instance and this\none is an easy command from your cloud\nshell which basically creates an\ninstance you see the zone which has been\nset it is the standard machine type it\nis not preemptable it has an internal ip\nand it has an external ip\nnow i have created an instance and here\ni can just go back and then i can just\ndo a refresh on this page and that\nalready shows me the instance which i\nhave created and then you can use the\nsame method to connect to it using an\nssh so i have an instance created from\nmy cloud shell\nand what i can do is i can basically\nlook into instances and see what are the\ndifferent options with instance so if we\ndid a create\nright you have an option delete\nwe did a create you have an option\ndelete you can be then deleting the\ninstance from the command line or you\ncan use other options so you can do a\nlist you can do a stop\nyou can start so i can basically do a\nstop and let's say even let's go ahead\nand do a stop commands are pretty easy\nhere to remember or you can always use\nthe help option and now i'm trying to\nstop the instance and then basically i\ncan go ahead and delete it so this is a\nsimple way where i created a instance\nfrom the command line or from the\nconsole which i showed earlier and\nsimilarly you can be working with other\noptions so now i've created stop the\ninstance let's do a listing to see\nif my instance shows up\nit shows up right and it says the status\nis terminated so you have stopped it\nit's in the terminated status and now\nwhat i can do is i can go ahead and\ndelete it\nso it says this will be lost are you\nsure you would want to continue just say\nyes and that should take care of\ndeleting your instance\nso this is a quick demo on creating your\ninstance we have already seen how you\ncan connect to these instances using ssh\nnow that we have created instances let's\nalso see how to use google cloud's\nstorage\nservice which can be used to load data\nor upload data so for this we will have\nto look into your google cloud storage\noptions and here you can look in cloud\nstorage so let's go back here on the top\nwhich shows me different services which\nwe have here and let's look into storage\nso this one shows me your storage option\nnow you can click on browser and that\nbasically shows me your storage browser\nwhich shows me on the top you have\noptions for\ncreating a bucket\nnow google cloud storage allows you to\nstore any kind of data here the easiest\nand the simplest way would be by using\ncloud console although you can again use\ncloud shell and in that you can use your\ngsutil command\nand gsutil basically has different\noptions where you can be\nusing say for example i would want to\nwork on buckets so i can be using mb and\nthen i can use my command line option to\ncreate buckets i can put in data there i\ncan browse it and i can access the data\nfrom command line so let's create a\nbucket here\nlet's click on this let's give it a name\nso let's say my\ndata important that's the name\nnow i can click on continue straight\naway i can look into all of these\noptions if i'm interested in\nso you can basically be looking at your\nmonthly cost estimate in the beginning\nnow i can click on continue or you can\nsay choose where to store your data and\nthis one shows you different options so\nyou have region specific\nso let's also give the bucket name with\nall lower case that's what is required\nyeah so coming back to the location type\nyou can choose multi-region which\nbasically allows high availability\nso your bucket or your storage option\nwill be accessible across regions\nyou can also give dual region and high\navailability and low latency across two\nregions i can also say region specific\nso for our use case we can just give\nregion specific which can keep our cost\nlow but in business use cases you would\nbe going for multi-region now here you\nhave location and i would again go for\nsay europe and let's choose europe west\n3 frankfurt it is always a good practice\nthat when you create your instances when\nyou create your storage\nor you use different services try to\nhave a geographical region chosen and\nthen you would try to put things or your\nservices within the particular region\nwithin a particular zone unless you\nwould want to make it\naccessible and available across regions\nnow i can then choose a default storage\nclass so when you say default storage\nclass there are different storage class\nand each one is for a different use case\nso you have standard which is best for\nshort-term storage and frequently\naccessed data you have near line so this\nis basically best for backups and data\naccess less than once a month you can\nalso have cold lines so these are\nbasically like your cold storage or\nfreezing storage which you might have\nheard generally as terms so you can\nchoose one of these storage classes\ndepending on what will be the use case\nfor this particular storage bucket so\nlet it be standard now how to control\naccess to objects so you can basically\nsay specify access to individual objects\nby using object level permissions\nnow you can give permissions to the\nbucket you can just say\nuniform access to all objects in the\nbucket by using only bucket level\npermissions so you can choose that you\ncan also go into advanced settings and\nhere you can see different ways in which\nyou can have configuration setup now you\ncan also have a retention policy to\nspecify the minimum duration where that\nthis bucket's object must be protected\nfrom deletion and you can set a\nretention policy will not get into all\nthat we will just first try creating a\nbucket so just click on create and that\nshould create your bucket wherein i have\nmy bucket now i can click on overview to\nsee the details what is the region\nwhich region it belongs what is the\nstorage class anytime you can always\nclick on edit bucket and make some\nchanges here you can look at the\npermissions so bucket uses fine grained\naccess allowing you to specify access to\nindividual objects\nand then you can basically look at who\nhas access to this so in my case\neditors of the project they basically\nare the bucket owners\nowners of project viewers of the project\nright and you can basically choose what\nkind of access you need so for this\nyou can always go into cloud storage and\nthen you can decide what kind of access\nyou would want to give whether that's a\nstorage admin it's an object admin\nobject creator object viewer and so on\nyou can always look at storage legacy\nand for any other services depending on\nwhat apis you have enabled right you can\nalways control your permissions so right\nnow it is storage legacy bucket reader\nand that's fine and this one is bucket\nowner and then might be i was using some\nother services like data proc which uses\ncloud storage and that's why i have\ngiven data proc service agent also so\nthese are some of the members you can\nremove\nyou can view by specific members you can\nview by roles so what are the different\nroles which have access to this so it\nsays storage legacy bucket owner there\nare two owners\nbased on this particular project so\nthese are auto controlled but then you\ncan add or remove machines you can save\nstorage cost by adding a life cycle rule\nto delete objects after the duration of\ncurrent retention policy so you can add\ndifferent policies\nand you can basically control your\nbucket now my bucket is already created\nright so i can go back and then i see my\nbucket is already here i can click on\nthis option and you can anytime edit the\nbucket permissions you can edit the\nlabels the default storage class you can\njust go ahead and delete the bucket you\ncan export it to cloud pub sub so\nbasically if you would want to have the\ncontent from this bucket\nbeing accessible in a message queuing\nsystem you can go for pub sub you can\nprocess with cloud functions and you can\nscan with cloud data loss prevention so\nthere are different options which are\navailable we can always select this\nbucket and delete it now i can click on\nthe bucket\nand that basically shows me different\nways in which i can upload some data\nhere so i can just click on upload files\nand here then i can choose some files so\nfor example i'll go in here\ni'll go into data sets and i have\ndifferent data sets so for example let's\nchoose this one which is a csv file\nand then i'm just uploading this to my\ncloud storage right it's as simple as\nthis so you can drag and drop your files\nor you can just upload your files\nand my file is uploaded here now i can\nbasically edit permissions for this one\nright so this is in the bucket so anyone\nwho has access to this bucket can\nbasically download this file it can they\ncan copy move or rename this you can\nexport it and you can look at the\npermissions of this file so let's look\nat edit permissions and it says\nfor this project whoever is the owner it\nhas access i've also given a specific\nuser my gmail id and i've given access\nso at any point of time you can just say\nadd item and then you can start giving\ndifferent kind of accesses\nso let's click on cancel here now my\ndata is already uploaded into this\nparticular bucket and that's a simple\nusage of your cloud storage\nnow what we can also do is i can\nbasically select this and i can delete\nit i can also create specific folders\nand then basically\nload data into it i can click on this\none i can just do a download and then i\ncan download it anywhere on my machine\nso let's go to desktop and let's\ndownload this file so we not only\nuploaded some content in the bucket but\nwe also downloaded that in a different\nlocation which will be accessible now\nwhat i could have also done is i could\nhave created a folder here and i could\nhave specified\nsay for example immediate immediate data\nokay and i'm clicking on this one so\nthat's my immediate data i can click on\nthis one and now\ni can upload my data specifically to\nthis particular folder by using the same\nmechanism you can just do upload file\nlet's choose air passengers\nlet's do a open and my file will be\nuploaded\nso you can always choose what is the\nretention expiry date for this one so as\nof now there is nothing right but you\ncan be deleted objects can be deleted or\nmodified until they reach their minimum\nduration you can control all of that you\ncan basically download it right you can\ncopy it and you can move it and rename\nit so this is a simple example where i\ncreated a particular bucket right now if\nfor example you click on this transfer\nso it says cloud storage data transfer\nproducts have moved you can now find\nstorage transfer service on-premise data\nand transfer appliance in new data\ntransfer section right so you can always\ngo back\nto cloud storage you can also look at\ntransfer options which are mainly when\nyou are using an on-premise service and\nyou would want to upload data in a\ngoogle cloud right\nso this is\nmy bucket here now i can go to cloud\nconsole and here what i can do is if i\nwould be interested in working so i can\njust say gsutil\nright and then we have\nfor example let's try a help okay and\nthat basically shows me my gsutil now\nyou can always go to quick start gsutil\ntool and this is one more way wherein\nbasically you can do it from the command\nline so working with buckets so you can\ndo a gsu till mb minus b and then on a\nparticular zone if you would be\ninterested in and then you can say gs\ncolon and give a name so my awesome\nbucket this is how you will create a\nbucket\nwhich will show you it is creating a\nbucket and then basically you can upload\nan image or some data from internet you\ncan just do a wget download the file and\nthen you can just do a gsutil copy\ncommand and that basically will pick up\nthe file from your cloud shell location\nput it in your bucket\nonce you have done that you can always\ndo a copy\nright so here you are doing a copy from\nyour local machine that is your cloud\ncell machine to your bucket and you can\ndo the reverse of that that is you can\ndo a copy and you can point your bucket\nand the file and download it to your\ndesktops so you can just download that\nusing the command line\nand you can copy the object to a folder\nin the bucket so that is by creating a\nparticular folder and you are pushing\nthe file into a particular bucket you\ncan list the contents of a bucket using\nls and then give your bucket name so gs\ncolon so we can just try this one to be\nsimple and rest you guys can try so here\nyou can just do a gsutil\nyou can do a ls\ngs colon slash\nand then i need to give my bucket name\nso in my case the bucket name was\nmy data important so let's try that so\nlet's say my data important and i'm\ntrying to list the bucket and the\ncontent it has right and then you have a\nfolder and then you can look into the\nfolder and look into the files\nso this is a simple quick option wherein\nyou can use your cloud shell you could\nbe using your google cloud sdk from your\nlocal machine\nor you can be using cloud console to\ncreate a bucket upload some data on it\ndownload the data see if the data is\naccessible and that basically shows you\nthe power of cloud storage where you can\neasily upload any kind of data now what\nwe can also do is as you are using a\nfree account or even a paid account\nunless and until you would want to keep\nthe bucket you can select it and you can\njust go ahead and delete it so this will\nbasically ask you to key in the bucket\nname and let's say my data important\nyou need to confirm your bucket name\nclick on confirm and you could have done\nthat using gsutil and a delete command\nfrom the command line that is from cloud\nshell so we have now created a bucket we\nhave uploaded some data into it we saw\nhow you can download it or create a\nfolder and upload some specific data\ninto it and also you can do the same\nthing using gsutil tools\nwherein you can list your bucket create\nyour buckets delete it create some\nfolders into it and do everything from\nthe command line so this is in simple\nway you can use your gcp where either\nyou can spin up your machines or you can\nuse cloud storage to basically use a\nstorage or a easy to use instance on\ngoogle cloud platform welcome to this\ntutorial about google cloud platform\nand here\nwe will learn about cloud computing what\nis cloud computing\nwhat is\ngcp that is your google cloud platform\nwhat are the benefits of google cloud\nplatform and what are its different\nservices\na little bit about google's\ninfrastructure a comparison of different\ncloud providers\nsuch as google offering gcp that is\ngoogle's cloud platform amazon offering\namazon web services and microsoft which\noffers azure we will also learn about\ndomino's pizza use case and then have a\nquick demo on using some of the services\non gcp\nbefore we begin let's understand\nwhy cloud computing\nand it would be always good to learn\nabout cloud computing based on a use\ncase there are varied use cases where\norganizations are adopting or\nmoving\ntheir solutions or their infrastructure\ninto cloud or i can simply say\nintegrating with cloud now here is one\nuse case\nnina started a company that relates to\nwebsite development\nthe challenges which nina was facing\nwere low memory space\nwhenever required for processing or for\nany other kind of application related\nwork\nhigh traffic to website that crashed it\nand also less number of servers\nnow with these challenges she was then\nreferred to concept of cloud computing\nand how that could benefit and help her\nin solving her issues\nmost of her issues were solved\nwhen she started using cloud computing\nand with cloud computing she could\nincrease her memory\nspace as required that is on demand\ncontrol the load\nto the website that is basically load\nbalancing and handling more requests on\nthe website or requests per minute\nbuying\nservers at a lower price that is\nscaling up or down based on the\nrequirement\nwhen we talk about cloud computing\ncloud computing is use of hardware and\nsoftware components which a cloud\nprovider offers as a service\nwhich can be accessed over network cloud\ncomputing is use of these resources\nwhich could be either dedicated\nresources or coming from a pool of\nresources which cloud provider offers to\ndeliver a service to\nclients\nusers can access these different\nservices\napplications files from any device\nwhich can basically access internet\ncloud computing allows automatic\nsoftware integration\nit allows backing up and restoring of\ndata\nit basically offers unlimited storage\nmemory or computation capacity\nit gives access to reliable sources\nwhich usually the cloud provider\nthemselves are using for their use case\nand it is a cost efficient model which\nhelps organizations to quickly\nintegrate\nor\nbasically modernize their infrastructure\ncloud computing is usually\nused\nwith id or\nwithin it space\nwherein\nthere are five traits\nif there is a requirement of resources\nas the business dynamically changes or\ngrows\nso for this cloud computing offers\non-demand self-service\nso\nusers could be using on-demand computing\nresources\nor memory resources storage network and\nso on provided by cloud provider and\nalso do a self-service\nall this is possible using a simple\ninterface\nand users can be\nusing processing power storage network\nas they need and pay as they go so there\nis least or no human intervention\nrequired\nwhen it comes to\nprojects which might need\nscalable network access\ncloud computing offers broad network\naccess that is accessing resources over\nnetwork across geographical regions or\nwhat we call as availability zones\nwhich might be multiple sites within a\nparticular geographical region\ncloud providers also have what we call\nas a resource pooling so this basically\nprovides a huge pool of resources which\nare shared and can be accessed by\ncustomers at a lower cost now there\nmight be customers which are interested\nin not sharing the resources and would\nbe interested in dedicated resources and\nin this case cloud provider also have\nsole tenant offerings which help such\ncustomers\nif an it business or any other business\nneeds rapid elasticity\nthen cloud providers also have resources\nwhich are offered which are elastic\nyou can get more resources rapidly as\nneeded and thus you can scale up and\ndown think of a gaming company which\nwould be interested in launching a new\ngame\nand they would have predicted a certain\nnumber of users which would get on to\nthe portal playing the game and what\nhappens if\nthe request per minute or if the number\nof users who are joining in\nmight increase\nnow in this case organization would want\nan underlying solution which handles\nthis dynamism scales\nas\nneeded on demand and once the demand is\ndone scales down\nthis is possible using a cloud computing\nsolution\ncloud computing solutions also include\nmeasured services that is pay as you go\nmodel for the usage or for the\nreservations which a user or\norganization would have made for\nresources offered by cloud computing so\nwhen we talk about cloud computing one\nof the question which always arises is\nwhy is this model so compelling why is\nthis so interesting for organizations or\nusers who would want to use one or many\nservices from cloud computing so first\nwave of trend which brought storage\ncloud computing was what we call as colo\nthat is co-location\ni.t shops\nthat have been\nusing or\nmanaging huge amount of data from\ndecades basically wanted to build\ntheir infrastructures to handle their\nbusiness needs\nnow\ninstead of building costlier data\ncenters\nthey would rent space or share\nfacilities and this was being done by\norganizations even in past\nthus they would free up the capital for\nother use cases\nnow this was more of user configured\nmanaged and maintained by them\nlater organizations started thinking of\nvirtualization so that was again user\nconfigured\nbut provider managed and maintained\nso components of a virtualized data\ncenter\nmatched that of a physical data center\nand\norganizations would have virtual devices\nseparately managed from underlying\ndevices\nthen later came container based\narchitectures or basically\nautomated services\nso within google services are\nautomatically provisioned and configured\nletting your infrastructure scale\non demand there are various reasons why\nan organization would think of\nintegrating with cloud or\nbenefiting\nby using cloud\nand thus\ninstantaneously\nreaping the benefits of modernizing\ntheir infrastructure\nnow few famous cloud providers are here\nso you have\namazon which offers amazon web services\nand\na huge list of services\nwhich come in with this you have\nmicrosoft's azure you have oracle's\ncloud you have saps cloud solutions gcp\nwhich is offered by google salesforce\nand so on there are many other small\nplayers which are also providing\ndifferent services which are cloud-based\nor\norganizations which are partnering with\nthese main cloud providers thus offering\ncloud services to their customers\nwhen we talk about why google cloud\nplatform there are various reasons why\nsomeone would choose google cloud\nplatform\ngcp has better pricing compared to its\ncompetitors\nwhen it comes to speed and performance\nit is very fast and increases the\nperformance of the project\nlive migration of apps and there are\nhuge number of solutions which i will\nshow you further in further screens\nwhich help an organization to adopt to a\ncloud platform an integrated with cloud\nplatform or even completely migrate into\na cloud platform\nnone of google's competitors provide\nlive migration of apps\nwhen we talk about big data ai machine\nlearning kind of solutions gcp provides\na lot of innovative solutions\nin comparison to other cloud providers\nsuch as aws azure and so on\nso what is google cloud platform it has\na set of cloud computing services\nprovided by google that runs on the same\ninfrastructure that google uses\nto and for its end user products like\nyoutube gmail and so on\nlet's learn about benefits of google\ncloud platform\nsuch as high productivity\nworking from anywhere\nquick collaboration high security\nfewer data stored on vulnerable devices\nreliable resources which can be used\nacross organization across geographical\nregions\nacross countries\nvery flexible which allows organizations\nto scale up and down\nas\nthe demand rises or as the demand\ndeclines\nand cost effective solutions for various\nuse cases these are some of the benefits\nand if we look into different services\nwhich google cloud platform offers\nwe could look into detailed benefits\nwhich each service offers in a different\nuse case which basically helps\norganizations\nworking in different domains handling\ndifferent kind of small mid or larger\nbusinesses and with different business\ngoals\nwhen we talk about google cloud platform\nservices here is a list of\nservices or i could say high level\ndomains or categories of services\nso you have compute related services you\nhave storage and database\nyou have networking big data\ndeveloper tools identity and security\nmanagement\ninternet of things cloud ai management\ntools and also data transfer solutions\nwhen we talk about google's\ninfrastructure\ngoogle has one of the most powerful\ninfrastructure in the world\nthe infrastructure is available in two\nlevels the physical and the abstract\nlayers you have physical infrastructure\nand then you have the abstract\ninfrastructure\nphysical infrastructure consists of data\ncenters\nextensive development of high efficiency\nbackend data centers\nyou have a very strong backbone network\nwhich is used by google itself and also\noffered\nas services to customers via gcp\nplatform services so\nyou have global messed redundant\nbackbone network\npoints of presence\nwhen we talk about google it has 110\nplus edge points of presence in more\nthan 200 countries and when we talk\nabout edge caching\nedge caching platform at periphery of\ntheir network\nso this is\nwhat defines the physical infrastructure\nof google now there is much more to it\nrather than just these four points when\nwe talk about abstract infrastructure\nthat is divided in global\nregions and zones\nwhen we talk about\nzone a zone is roughly equivalent to a\ndata center\nand a single point of failure so you\ncould have your compute engine\nwhich is within a zone or you could say\ncompute engine is a zonal resource\nyou have regions which are geographical\nareas which contain multiple zones\nso you would have a region for u.s\ncentral or\neurope central europe west and so on and\nwithin a region you would have one or\nmultiple zones and zones basically would\nallow high availability of resources\nso you have cloud load balancer is an\nexample which is regional resource then\nyou have global resources and they are\navailable and shared across the planet\nso you have various global resources\nsuch as network\nwhich could be even your ip addresses\nand so on\nnow let's do a quick comparison of aws\nwest azur west\ngcp and let's look at what each cloud\nprovider offers\nlater we will also look into different\nservices\nin detail when it comes to google cloud\nplatform what each service does\nwhat you can benefit from which service\nshould you use in what case we will\nlearn about those in later slides\nif i compare\nyour different cloud providers\nwhen we talk about amazon\nand its cloud offerings that is amazon\nweb services or aws as we will know it\namazon web services has 69 availability\nzones within 22 geographical locations\nand soon it will have 12 more in future\nso this number keeps growing based on\nthe spread of the services which a\nparticular cloud provider offers\nhere we are talking about availability\nzone specific information when we talk\nabout microsoft's azure it has 54\nregions worldwide and is available in\n140 countries across the globe\nwhen we talk about google cloud world\ncloud platform is available in 200 plus\ncountries across the globe\nwhen we talk about virtual servers\namazon's ec2 that is elastic compute\ncloud it is a web service which\nbasically helps to resize your compute\ncapacity where you can run your\napplication programs on a virtual\nmachine so using ec2 service you could\nlaunch virtual instances that could have\nany distribution of linux\nwindows you could have different\nspecifications when it comes to ram or\ncpu cores or disk you could also decide\non\nwhat kind of storage a particular\ninstance should use\nwhether the storage should be local to\nthe instance or whether that should be a\nelastic file system or even an object\nstorage\nwhen it comes to azure or microsoft's\noffering as your virtual machine that is\ninfrastructure as a service gives a user\nthe ability to deploy and manage a\nvirtual environment inside a virtual\nnetwork on the cloud\nand this virtual network on the cloud\nwould be managed by cloud provider\ngoogle cloud or\nthe offerings from google cloud platform\nthat is gcp vm instances enables users\nto build deploy and manage virtual\nmachines in order to run different kind\nof workloads on the cloud now when we\ntalk about compute engine here it would\nbe good to discuss a little bit more\nabout compute engine and what are the\ndifferent options which google cloud\noffers so when you talk about your\ncompute engine\nyou have\nscalable high performance virtual\nmachines\ncompute engine delivers configurable\nvirtual machines which run in google's\ndata center with access to high\nperformance networking infrastructure\nand block storage and you could select\nvms for your needs that could be general\npurpose or workload optimized and when\nwe talk about workload optimized you\nhave predefined machines or you have\ncustom machine sizes\nyou can integrate compute with other\ngoogle cloud services such as ai or ml\nand\ngo for your data analytics you have when\nwe talk about your gcp vm instances just\nto expand on that you have general\npurpose\ninstances which we call as n2\nwhich provide a balance between price\nand performance and they are well suited\nfor most workloads including line of\nbusiness applications web servers and\ndatabases\ngoogle cloud also offers compute\noptimized instances\nwhich we call as c2 instances which\noffer consistent high-end virtual cpu\nperformance\nwhich are good for aaa gaming\neda hpc and other applications\nnow when we talk about compute optimize\nyour general purpose how would we leave\nmemory optimized instances those are m2\nmachines which google offers so these\noffer highest amount of memory these vms\nare well suited for in-memory databases\nsuch as sap hana real-time analytics and\nin-memory caches\nso if i would summarize this when we\ntalk about\ndifferent instances aws\nalso offers different kind of instances\nwhich are memory or compute\nor\ndisk optimized you have general purpose\nand each\ncategory of machines has a different\npricing model you can always go to an\naws website look for the pricing models\nand that will give you an idea of\non-demand instances or dedicated\ninstances reserved instances and so on\nsimilarly if you talk about google cloud\ngoogle cloud also has instances with\nvarious options\nwhich become the key features of why\ncustomers would choose google cloud\nplatform such as live migration for vms\nso compute engine within your gcp can\nlive migrate between host systems and\nwhen i say live migrate it basically\nmeans without rebooting which keeps your\napplication running even when the\nunderlying host systems require\nmaintenance you also have preemptable\nvirtual machines wherein you can run bad\njobs and fault tolerant workloads on\npre-emptible vms to reduce your virtual\ncpu and memory cost by up to 80 while\ngetting the same performance so these\nare your preemptive or preemptable\nvirtual machines the only demonic is\nthese can give you a really cost\nefficient\nresource usage however can be taken off\nthe shelf anytime and that's why we call\nthem preemptable virtual machines you\nalso have sole tenant nodes which are\nphysical compute engine servers\ndedicated explicitly or exclusively for\nusers use case\nand\nwhen we talk about sole tenant nodes\nthese are usually good when you are\ndealing with or when you are working\nwith your applications which we call as\nbring your own license applications so\nsole tenant nodes give you access to\nsame machine types and virtual machine\nconfig options as regular compute\ninstances\nso there are different options which\ngoogle cloud offers when it comes to\nthese instances which we are talking\nabout and it takes care of different use\ncases in comparison to other cloud\nproviders which are also offering these\nservices such as you can have\npre-defined machine types you can have\ncustom machine types preemptable vms as\ni said\nlive migration of vms\nyou can use persistent disks which could\ngive you durable high performance block\nstorage you have local ssds you also\nhave gpu accelerators which can be added\nto accelerate computational\nintensive workloads such as machine\nlearning simulation medical analysis and\nso on and you have features such as\nglobal load balancing which\nmakes google cloud a unique choice\nwhen we talk about platform as a service\namazon has\nplatform as a service offering which we\ncall as elastic bean stock\namong one of its services it's an\norchestration service for deploying\napplications and helping in maintaining\nthese applications\nazure cloud service\nprovides a platform to write the user\napplication code without worrying about\nthe hardware resources\ngoogle app engine is a service used by\ndevelopers for building and hosting\napplications on google's data centers\nwhen we talk about server-less computing\nso amazon's aws lambda is a server-less\ncompute service it is used to execute\nback-end code and scales automatically\nwhen required when we talk about azure\nyou have something called as functions\nwhich allow users\nto build applications using server-less\nsymbol functions with a programming\nlanguage of their choice\nwhen we talk about google cloud\ngcp has cloud functions which is easiest\nway to run your code in the cloud and it\nis highly available and fault tolerant\nso in these days when we are talking\nabout microservices architecture which\norganizations are preferring when we are\ntalking about organizations which can\nscale which can dynamically change their\nunderlying architecture\norganizations would be interested in\nserver less computing where they do not\nhave to have a infrastructure setup\nplanned in advance before going for\ntheir use case and this is where\nmonolithic applications\nare really not a preferred choice\na lot of organizations are decomposing\ntheir applications into microservices\nbased on\nbusiness capability or decomposing based\non sub domains we can learn about\nmicroservices architecture later but\njust to know that serverless computing\nwhich\nbasically helps any organization if for\nexample if you have a web application\nthat receives\nnon-linear traffic and you cannot keep\nan eye on your server always\nit would be good to have someone to auto\nscale your application\nserverless is basically a computing\nmodel where cloud service provider is\nresponsible for managing the piece of\ncode\nwithout the developer having to bother\nabout infrastructure setup\nmanagement maintenance and so on\nnow when we talk about applications\nbeing serverless or benefiting from\nserverless computing\none of the key things would be zero\nadministration so deploying application\nwithout any provisioning and management\nauto scaling capability that is let the\nservice provider worry about\nscaling the application up and down\nyou have paper use model which any\ncustomer would want to benefit from\nthat is pay only for the resources that\nyou have used or that you are continuing\nto use\nright shorten the time between\nidea implementation and employment and\nthis is something which any organization\nwould want that\nyou would want\na faster\nbring to the market solution timeline in\ncomparison to getting entangled with\ndeployment management and maintenance of\nyour underlying infrastructure when your\napplications are facing a high demand\nso when we talk about serverless\nit is a function as a service\nbecause each part of your application is\ndivided as functions and can be hosted\nover multiple service providers\nyou have serverless apps which are\nusually divided as separate units or\nfunctions based on functionalities or\ndomains and so on so serverless\ncomputing is gaining quite popularity\nthese days\nin comparison to the traditional\nthree-tier architecture\nwhere you had a presentation layer you\nhad an application layer you had a\ndatabase layer now that kind of\ninfrastructure is not really preferred\nin today's modern times when\norganizations are working on different\nkind of newer applications\nwhen we talk about object storage amazon\nhas simple storage service that is s3 it\nprovides object storage which is built\nfor storing and recovering information\nor data from anywhere over the internet\nazure\ncomes up with blob storage that is\nbinary large objects storage offers\nlarge amount of storage and scalability\nit stores the object in the tiers and\ndepending on how often the data is being\naccessed now same thing applies to even\ns3\nwhich is from amazon so s3 also has\ndifferent kind of storage classes which\ncan be selected when a user or\norganization intends to use a storage\nservice and when i speak about storage\nclasses it basically means\nhaving a frequent access storage or a\ninfrequent access storage or what we\ncall as\njust an archival solution\ngoogle cloud has cloud storage and it\nprovides unified object storage for live\nor archive data the service is used to\nstore and access data on gcp\ninfrastructure\nwhen it comes to advantages\namazon web services\nhas enterprise friendly services easy\naccess to resources\nincrease in speed and agility and that\ntoo on demand and takes care of your\nsecurity and reliability of resources\nwhich are offered\nwhen it comes to azure it has better\ndevelopment operations strong security\nprofile provides lot of cost effective\nsolutions and\noperation\nexecution friendly\nwhen we talk about google cloud one of\nthe key features here is better pricing\nthan competitors\nlive migration of virtual machines which\nreally interests lot of organizations\nwould want to\nmodernize their infrastructure without\nhaving any kind of disruption in their\nexisting services improved performance\nredundant backups and so on\nwhen it comes to disadvantages\nin aws you have limitations when it\ncomes to ec2 service well there are\ndifferent options in the kind of\nmachines which you can choose which you\ncan work on\nyou have a technical support fee\nwhich is incurred network connectivity\nand then\nalso downtime which might be in case\nwhen you are migrating azure it has\ndifferent code base for cloud and\npremise\nplatform as a service ecosystem is not\nreally as efficient as infrastructure as\na service\npoor management of gui and tools\nintegrated backup\nwhen we talk about google cloud support\nfee is quite hefty\nit depends on what kind of solution or\nsupport you would or organization would\nbe interested in it has a complex\npricing schema\nalthough it has different use cases for\nwhich\nany user or any organization can benefit\nfrom\ndownloading data from google cloud\nservices is an expensive option storage\nmight not be however uploading data or\ndownloading data would be an expensive\noption\nwhen we talk about domino's pizza use\ncase now while we were discussing about\nthese features i would really want to\nspend more time in\ndiscussing each of these features or\nservices in detail such as you have\ncompute engine\nyou have storage\nyou have big table you have data proc\nand so on so there are huge list of\nservices now before we get into\nyour domino's bizarre use case let me\nshow you this page on google cloud where\nyou can\nlook at different services so if you go\nto cloud.google.com and if you look at\nget started option under dock so here\nyou can find build solutions look at\ndifferent use cases learn from basics of\nwhat is your\ngoogle cloud what are cloud basics then\nyou can look at different cloud products\nso here you have products in different\ncategories such as ai and machine\nlearning api management compute\ncontainers data analytics databases\ndeveloper tools and so on and you can\nalways\nclick on\nany one of these to look into different\nsolutions which are being offered what\nare the different use cases what are the\nbest practices when it comes to\nmigrating vms to compute engine or\noperating containers or building\ncontainers and so on you can always look\nat featured products and that gives you\na quick snapshot of what are the\ndifferent products such as you have\ncompute engine you have cloud run\nbigquery which is a data warehouse you\nhave cloud sql which is a managed mysql\nor postgres you have cloud storage to\nbasically push in any kind of data there\nyou have security key enforcement ai and\nmachine learning and so on so you have\ndifferent feature products now if you\nscroll down\nto the lower end of this page\nyou can again look at\ndifferent solutions and that would be\nreally interesting to read and learn\nfrom so you have infrastructure\nmodernization you have application\nmodernization you have data management\nand so on so if i look at\ninfrastructure modernization\nyou could basically look at the\nsolutions which google cloud offers\nand what it does when it comes to\nhaving your\ninfrastructure modernized or benefiting\nby\nintegrating with cloud\nand having immediate benefits of\ninfrastructure modernization you can\nlook at different use cases what they\nare doing how google cloud really helps\nwhen it comes to\nmigrating the workloads to a cloud\nand how your different cloud solutions\nsuch as vm migration you have sap on\ngoogle cloud vmware as a service and so\non and you could learn from these\ndifferent solutions which are offered\nyou can also look at application\nmodernization so not only infrastructure\nmodernization but organizations would\nalso be interested in re-looking at\ntheir applications re-looking at how\nthese applications\ncould be moved from monolithic to\nmicroservices architecture or how\napplications can benefit from\nmodernization and cloud computing\nofferings so you have again different\nuse cases here\nwhich talks about different ways in\nwhich google cloud can help how you can\nmodernize your applications how you can\nuse different solutions which google\ncloud is offering now when you talk\nabout cloud computing services you can\nalways go into cloud.google.com\nif you have created a free account then\nyou can just log in and every user by\ndefault gets a 300 free credit\nso when they can try out different\nproducts where they can use different\nservices\nso here if i click on console where i'm\nalready logged in with my\ngmail account or my google cloud account\nwherein i have 300 free credit out of\nwhich some is being used you have a\ngoogle cloud console and here from the\nhamburger menu you can click and you can\nlook at different services within\ndifferent domains so you have compute\ndomain which has different services such\nas app you have compute engine and that\nbasically allows you to use your vm\ninstances which we were talking about\nprevious slides different instance\ngroups create your templates use sole\ntenant nodes\ncreate snapshots or backup of your data\nuse different zones you can go for\nkubernetes which is containerized based\nengine you have cloud functions\nyou have cloud run and then you have\nstorage related different options such\nas big table you have data store fire\nstore file store storage and so on and\nfor each of these services you can read\nabout from the google's documentation or\nanyways i will be explaining that later\nyou can also look at networking related\noperation related and other tools which\nare offered by google cloud so these are\nhuge list of services which google cloud\nplatform offers\nin different ways for different use\ncases\nnow let's look at this domino's pizza\nuse case\nand see what it helps us learn about so\nyou can always access this page by going\nto this link which talks about customers\nand then which shows you different use\ncases\nso domino's increasing monthly revenue\nby six percent with google analytics\npremium google tag manager and google\nbigquery\nso this is\nbasically when\ndomino's started using gcp and what was\nthe result of that\nnow let's look further into this\nso we all know that domino is most\npopular pizza delivery\nchain operating across the globe but how\nis that possible let's take a look so\nthe challenges were they wanted to\nintegrate marketing measurement across\nvarious devices\nconnecting crm and digital data to\ncreate a clear view of customer behavior\nto make cross-channel marketing\nperformance analysis easy and efficient\nnow for these challenges which dominos\nwas facing the solution was using google\nanalytics premium\ngoogle tag manager and bigquery which\nwere used to integrate digital data\nsources and crm data\nreporting was made easier and more\nefficient by implementing google\nanalytics premium because it had the\nability to access a single google\nanalytics account\nto evaluate web and app performance\nby using the new google tag manager\nimplementation\ndominos were able to act fast\nthey were able to connect crm data with\ndigital analytics which basically\nprovided domino with greater visibility\non customer behavior what was the result\nthere was an immediate six percent\nincrease in monthly revenue\neighty percent of costs and ad serving\nand operations were saved\nincreases\nagility with streamlined tag management\nthey obtained easy access to powerful\nreporting and customized dashboards now\nthat was just one simple use case before\nwe go on to hands-on we can also talk a\nlittle bit\nback\nabout these services which google cloud\noffers\nas we discussed and some of these\nservices which can really make you think\nwhy not google cloud platform so when we\ntalk about your different cloud platform\nservices\nlet's learn about some of these services\nin brief in what each service is what it\ndoes and how it can help us\nin handling our use cases or working\nwith different\nproducts so let's learn briefly about\ndifferent services which google cloud\nplatform offers now one of the domains\nis compute and then let's look at the\ncompute services which gcp offers now\nhere i can log into the console and this\nhamburger menu on the top left corner i\ncan click on this one and go into the\ncompute engine section so this is the\ncompute domain which has app engine\nkubernetes engine cloud functions and\ncloud run so these are your different\nservices which are offered within the\ncompute domain and here we can get into\ncompute engine by clicking on this one\nand then basically going to vm instances\nso before we see how we can use this\ncompute engine let's understand about\nsome of the features of compute engine\nwhich basically offers scalable high\nperformance virtual machines which are\nconfigurable and which runs in google's\ndata center with access to high\nperformance networking infrastructure\nand block storage so from here you can\nselect vm for your needs for your\ngeneral purpose or workload optimized\npredefined or custom machines now here\nyou can integrate compute with other\ngoogle cloud services such as ai ml and\nother data analytics services you have\ndifferent machines which are offered\nhere such as general purpose\nwhich provide a balance between price\nand performance which are well suited\nfor most workloads including line of\nbusiness applications web services and\ndatabases you also have compute\noptimized machines which offer\nconsistent high end virtual cpu core\nperformance and which are mainly good\nfor gaming eda high process computing\nand other such applications apart from\ngeneral purpose compute optimize you\nalso have memory optimized machines\nwhich offer highest amount of memory and\nthese vms are basically well suited for\nin-memory databases such as sap hana\nreal-time analytics and in-memory cache\nnow we can see these options here you\ncan click on vm instances while you're\nlogged in into your google cloud console\nhere you can even create an instance\ntemplate which can be used to spin up\ninstances for example if i click on new\nvm instance from a template there are\nsome templates which i have already\ncreated for my usage now here i can\nbasically use one of these templates or\nwhat i can do is i can go back i can go\ninto instance templates and this\nbasically allows me to create a template\nso you can click on create instance\ntemplate which basically allows you to\ncreate templates which can be used to\nspin up different instances we can give\na name to the template for example we\ncan say template\ninstance\nnow here i can choose machine\nconfigurations and this is where you\nhave different options so you have\ngeneral purpose as i mentioned which\nprovide a balance between price and\nperformance you have memory optimized\nwhich are large memory machine types for\nmemory intensive workloads you also have\ncompute optimized which basically give\nyou high performance machine types for\ncompute intensive workloads so you can\nchoose any machine configuration which\nis available here based on your\nrequirements now if you click on general\npurpose that has different options here\nso you look into the series where you\nhave n1 series you have e2 which are cpu\nplatform selection based on availability\nyou have n2 and n2d so let's just have\nn1 selected now you also have here which\ntalks about machine types and here we\ncan choose the configuration which we\nare interested in depending on the\napplications which will run within the\nmachines we can choose a machine so by\ndefault it shows one virtual cpu core\nand 3.5\ngigabyte of memory or ram you could\nchoose a higher end machine so as of now\ni'll just say n1 standard\nnow that basically allows me to choose\nthese machines so there are different\nfeatures which your compute offers such\nas you have live migration for vms you\nhave preemptable virtual machines you\nhave sold tenant nodes and all those\noptions can be seen here now in this\nmachine for my boot disk i can select a\ndistribution which i would be interested\nin for example i could be going for\npublic images and i can choose for\nexample ubuntu and then i can choose a\nversion so it shows me 16.04\nand you also have latest versions such\nas ubuntu 20. you can choose one of\nthese and here it asks you to choose the\nboot disk type so that could be standard\npersistent disk which is hdds which are\nlow in performance and\nyou can say low in cost in comparison to\nssds so ssds give you better performance\nbut then they are little expensive than\nusing standard persistent disk we can\nchoose this and we can give a disk size\nfor example 20 gigabyte and i can click\non select before clicking on select i\ncan click on custom images and that\nshows me if you have any other images\ncreated in your project you could use\nthose you could also learn about images\nby clicking on this link so we'll click\non public images we have chosen this\ndistribution let's do a select and now\nhere you have identity and api access\nmanagement so let this be default you\ncan say allow default access and what\nyou need is depending on the services we\ncan choose it allows http and https\ntraffic now we would also need some way\nto connect to these machines so when you\nset up an instance by default you can do\nssh into it using the google cloud\nconsole or from cloud shell you can also\ngive a private and a public key so here\nyou have the option where you can give\nall these details so when it comes to\nmanagement it tells you what would you\nwant to go for reservations and you can\nsay automatically use created\nreservation you could also say no you\nwould not want to use a reservation you\ncan also set up or provide a startup\nscript which you would want to give\nwhenever your machines come up and here\nyou have the options of preemptability\nso compute offers preemptable virtual\nmachines so that is mainly when you\nwould want to run bad jobs and fault\ntolerant workloads on these machines and\nyou can benefit with a reduced cost for\nyour virtual cpu and memory by 80\npercent so these are virtual machines\nwhich would be lasting less than 24\nhours now by default this is off and it\npurely depends on your workload what you\nwould want to run on these instances i\ncould just go ahead and select\npreemptable being on that and use this\nfeature of compute you also have on host\nmaintenance which talks about what would\nbe happening with this compute engine\ninstance so when compute engine performs\nperiodic infrastructure maintenance it\ncan migrate your vm instances to other\nhardware and this is one of the features\nwhich compute engine offers which we\ncall as live migration for vms here your\ncompute engine can live migrate between\nhost systems that is the underlying\nsystems on which these vm instances are\nbased on without rebooting which will\nkeep your application running even when\nhost system require maintenance and here\nit says migrate vm instance recommended\nand let that be as it is you can also\nsay that if there is a maintenance\nhappening you can terminate the vm\ninstance now it also talks about\nautomatic restart which is on which\nbasically means compute engine can\nautomatically restart vm instances if\nthey are terminated from non-user\ninitiated reasons so these are all the\nsettings which are available in\nmanagement and it also tells us the\ndifferent features which we have there\nis also a feature called sold tenancy\nwhich basically means sold tenant sole\ntenant nodes which can be chosen so you\ncan have physical compute engine servers\ndedicated exclusively for your use and\nthis is usually good when you are\ntalking about bring your own license\napplications so sole tenant nodes give\nyou access to same machine types and vm\nconfiguration options as regular compute\ninstances however these might be a\nlittle expensive we can choose this one\nwe can also look into networking which\nbasically shows the default setup which\ngoes for auto subnet you can also choose\na particular ip if that is required but\nthat would cost more you can click on\ndisks which talk about what do you want\nto do with the boot disk when the\ninstance is deleted what is the\nencryption mechanism you would want to\nuse and here finally you have security\nso basically as i said you can ssh into\ninstance using the cloud console option\nand you can also provide a public ssh\nkey so one way of doing that if you\nintend to use an external ssh client\nsuch as putty to connect you can create\na key\nso for example i can go into puttygen\nand here i can say generate just move my\ncursor over here and that will create a\nkey i can give a name to this one so\ni'll say sdu will be username i'll give\na simple password which i will use to\nlogin to this machine and then i can\nsave this private key which will get\nsaved so let's say hdu new key and this\ngets saved in a dot ppk file which is\nusually used when you use an external\nssh client to connect so save this one\nand that saves a ppk file on your\ndesktop what you can also do is you can\ncopy this public key content from here\nand this is what we would want to give\nin our instance here so so that the\npublic key gets stored on the instance\nand private key is what we will use to\nconnect so once i paste it here it\nresolves the name to hdu and we have\ngiven the public key now in certain\ncases you may want to use a software\nwhich uses ssh to connect to the machine\nand that software might not be such as\nyour putty so in that case you may want\na pem file or a private key which is\nsaved as a dot pem file so you can also\ndo that by going to conversions and do a\nexport open ssh key and then save it so\ni'll say sdu new key but then this one\nwill be saved as a pem file on my\nmachine so you have ppk file which\nallows you to use putty to connect to\nthe instance you have a pem in case a\nsoftware needs directly ssh to these\nmachines you also have the public key\nwhich we have already provided in the\nmachine now once this is done i can\nclose puttygen i can go back to this\npage where i'm creating an instance\ntemplate and then i can just click on\ncreate so this has created a instance\ntemplate which i can use to spin up my\ninstances any number of instances using\nthe theme template only thing which i\nwould have to do is change the region\nwhere i would want the instance to run\nso now that we have created instance and\nthat's my this one the third option i\ncan go back to vm instances now i can\nclick on create and here i can either\ncreate an instance from scratch by\ngiving all the details again or i can\njust use my template so i can click on\nnew vm instance from a template choose\nmy template click on continue and once\nthis is done i can give my instance name\nso let's say c1 i can choose the region\nso i will choose frankfurt and then rest\neverything is auto populated based on\nthe template what you have given and you\nclick on create now this basically\nallows you to spin up an instance and\nyou can create any number of instances\nusing your template you could have\nalready created a new instance right\nfrom scratch now once the instance is\ncreated this has a public ip and a\nprivate ip private ip will not change\nunless\nyou would want to set up a new machine\nbut public ip will change every time you\nstop and start the machine now this is\nwhat we need to connect to this machine\ni can also do a ssh from here by doing\nthis in open in a browser window let's\nclick on this so this is an internal way\nof connecting to your instance\nusing ssh let's wait because it would be\ntransferring the ssh keys to the vm it\nestablishes a connection and i am\nconnected to my machine what we can\neasily do is to confirm if we are in the\nright machine we can just do a ls\nto look at the file system what we can\nalso do is we can basically log in as\nroot by doing a sudo su and that allows\nyou to get into the machine as root and\nfrom here i can switch to hdu user which\nwill have a dot ssh directory in home\nand that basically has authorized keys\nand if we would want to see if this one\ncontains my public key i can just do a\ncat dot ssh and then look into\nauthorized keys and this shows me the\npublic key which we had initially added\nto our instance so this confirms that we\nare logged into the machine which we\ncreated now i can close this\nand what i can also do is i can copy\nthis public ip so let's do a copy to\nclipboard now go to putty and here i\nwill say hostname where i'll say hdu\ngive my public key i'll click on ssh and\nin ssh i'll go to authentication now\nhere we need to give our ppk file so the\nppk file was sdu new key select this one\ncome back here come to the session give\nit a name for example c1 save it and\nthen you can just say open and say yes\nand you are logged in to your machine\nnow once you're logged in you can always\ndo a minus ssh and that shows you the\nfile so this is how you have just used\nthe compute engine to spin up an\ninstance but we used a template which\nbasically allowed me to create this\ninstance\nand then i can connect to this instance\nand then i can start working on this so\nwhen we talk about features of compute\nengine it has predefined machine types\nas we saw so compute engine offers\ndifferent predefined virtual machines\nand this they have configurations for\nevery need from small general purpose\ninstances to large memory optimized\ninstances with up to 11.5 terabytes of\nram you can have fast compute instances\noptimized up to 60 virtual cpu cores you\nalso have custom machine types so you\ncan create a vm that best fits your\nworkload and by tailoring a custom\nmachine type to your specific need you\ncan realize significant savings there\nare preemptable vms which we saw there\nis also a facility which allows you to\ntake the benefit of live migration for\nvms you have durable high performance\nblock storage for virtual machine\ninstances in the form of persistent\ndisks where data is stored redundantly\nfor integrity flexibility and to resize\nstorage without interruption and you\ncould be choosing hdds or sdds for your\ninstances now you also have option such\nas gpu accelerators so for example if i\njust click on create instance and i can\nlook into that so here let the instance\nname be instance one and what i would be\ninterested in looking at this one which\nsays cpu platform and gpu so cpu\nplatform configuration is permanent you\ncan also do add gpu so gpus can be added\nto accelerate computationally intensive\nworkloads like machine learning\nsimulation medical analysis and virtual\nworkstation\napplications so you can add and remove\ngpus to a vm when your workload changes\nand pay for gpu only while using so\nthese are some of the features which\nbasically compute engine offers and we\nalready know that google builds in\nsecond level increments so we only pay\nfor the compute time now there are\ndifferent savings which are possible so\nyou have commitment savings which\nbasically means you can save up to 57\npercent without upfront cost per\ninstance type lock-in\nyou have container support so you can\nbasically run manage and orchestrate\ndocker containers or compute engine\ninstances so here when we are setting up\nour instances there is an option which\nbasically allows you to use or deploy\ndocker images now that can be done you\ncan also benefit from sustained use\nsavings that is sustained use discounts\nwhich are automatic discounts for\nrunning compute engine resources for\nsignificant portion of the billing month\nyou can create a reservation for vm\ninstance in a specific zone which is\nbasically seen under your management\nsection here and you can ensure your\nproject has resources for future\nincreases in demand and if no longer\nneeded delete the reservation so these\nare some of the features of compute\nengine what we have done is we have\ncreated compute engine using the console\nnow you can go back you can also do that\nusing cloud shell and you can click on\nthis one which activates cloud shell you\ncould also have the cloud sdk support on\nsetup on your machine which can be used\nnow i can just open this in a new window\nand from here i can start giving\ncommands if i would be interested in\nsetting up an instance from my command\nline so here you have different options\nnow to begin with you can just do a g\ncloud and just hit enter and that will\nshow you different options which are\navailable which can be used so you have\ngcloud compute here which shows\nan option to create and manipulate\ncompute engine resources now i can just\ndo a queue to quit i can do gcloud\ncompute and that basically will again\nshow me different options which are\navailable if you would be interested in\nsetting up instances from the command\nline so here i can say g cloud compute\nand then go for instances\nand if you do not know the commands you\ncan just hit enter that will show you\nall the different options which we have\nso here we have different options such\nas list or create or start or update for\nexample i can just do a list here to see\nwhat instances i have and the instance\nwhich we just created shows up here it\nsays that status is running i can just\nstop this instance i can delete this\ninstance i can even create an instance\nby using a create command here and you\ncan just do a create help which will\nshow you what are the different options\nyou can give so it says instance name\nis what you need you can choose an\naccelerator you can choose the boot disk\nand various other options so i can just\nsay create\nand then i can give a name for example\nc2 and once i click on this one it says\ndid you mean europe west 4 zone so it is\nasking me for the region and the zone\nand i can say yes\nand these settings are coming from my\ndefault profile i can always change\nthose by changing the metadata so now we\nhave created an instance it says running\nif we do a list again to see we see two\ninstances created one was in europe west\nthree one was only europius west four\nboth of them have internal and external\neyepiece\nnow you can do a\ndescribe to look at the different\noptions here so g cloud basically allows\nyou different commands which you can use\nto work with your instance to create\ninstances to change the metadata if you\nwould want to change the region if you\nwould want to add a startup script all\nthose options are possible from the\ncommand line which we can learn in\ndetail in later sessions so this is your\ncompute engine as a service now that we\nhave learnt about\nthe compute domain\nand g\ncompute services which is offered by gcp\nlet's also learn about storage and\ndatabases that's again within the\nstorage domain and the services which\nare offered by google cloud platform now\nyou can go back to console and here you\ncan click on this one and here you can\njust scroll down to see what are the\ndifferent options in storage so you have\noptions such as bigtable you have data\nstore firestore file store you have sql\nbased services you have storage which is\nobject storage and then you have other\noptions which are available so google\ncloud platform offers different storage\nbased services out of which storage\nwhich is your object storage is quite\npopular one click on storage\nand that basically shows you an option\nwhich talks about storage\nbrowser so this is your google cloud's\nobject storage so when we talk about\nobject storage it is basically a storage\nwhere you could store any kind of data\nand when we talk about object storage it\nis a bunch of bytes which we address\nwherein every object will have a unique\nkey these unique keys are in the form of\nurl which allows you to access the\nobject so cloud storage is comprised of\nwhat we call as buckets which are used\nto store and hold your storage objects\nthe storage objects are immutable and\nevery change creates a new version now\nyou can also have control access via iam\nthat is identity access management or\nvia access control list so there is also\nan option called object versioning which\nbasically says if it is on every time\nyou try to store the same object a new\nversion of the object would be created\notherwise newer option will overwrite\nold one as we cannot archive the old\nversion so let's see how we work with\nthis object storage so here you can\nclick on create bucket\nnow once you click on create bucket it\nneeds a name so let's say test bucket\nand here i can just give say number one\nso that says this is the name of my\nbucket now i can directly click on\ncontinue or it would be good to look at\ndifferent options which are available\nhere\nso\nwhen you click on choose where to store\nyour data so\nit already gives me an option it says\nthe bucket name is already taken so let\nme give it a unique name so let's say\ntest buck and let's call it\naua so that should be unique now here it\nsays choose where to store your data\nso this one gives you location type so\nyou can have region specific buckets\nwhich give you lowest latency that is\nfastest response time within a single\nregion however it does not make your\nstorage highly available you can make a\ndual region which is basically allowing\nyour bucket or storage to be accessible\nacross regions you can also make it\nmulti-region which is highest\navailability offered as of now we can\nchoose region specific\nand now it asks you to choose a location\nnow as\nalways i will choose\nfrankfurt\nnow i can click on continue and rest all\nthe rest let all the storage options be\ndefault or you can click on a default\nstorage class now that tells you\nbased on your storage class there are\nvariant costs when it comes to storing\nretrieving or doing any kind of\noperations so you have a standard\noption which says best for short-term\nstorage and frequently accessed data you\ncan also go for cold storage such as\nnear line which is best for backups and\ndata access less than once a month you\ncan go for freezing storage such as cold\nline best for disaster recovery and data\naccessed less than once a quarter or you\ncan go for archiving where the data is\naccessed less than once a year let's go\nfor standard as of now and now you can\nchoose how to control access to objects\nso you have fine grained or uniform let\nit be fine grained wherein you can give\nadditional permissions\nat bucket level using iam or object\nlevel permissions using access control\nlist\nin advanced settings you can choose the\nencryption and you can also choose a\nretention policy so a retention policy\nto specify the minimum duration that\nthis buckets objects must be protected\nfrom deletion or modification after they\nare uploaded\nyou can always learn about this more by\nclicking here now once i have chosen all\nthe relevant options i can click on\ncreate and that basically will create a\nbucket by the name i have given i can\nclick on overview to basically see\nbrief details about my bucket such as\nregion what is the default storage class\nand it also shows you the link url which\ncan be used to access your bucket it\nalso gives you the link for gsutil now\ngsutil is a command which can be used in\nyour cloud shell to basically work with\nyour buckets you can click on\npermissions to basically see what kind\nof permissions are already in place and\nyou can then make changes you can\nbasically add members you can view by\ndifferent roles so for example here by\ndefault it shows\nother services such as data proc or your\nbucket owner or bucket reader related\npermissions which have been already\ngranted now once i have looked at my\nbucket i can start using it i can drag\nand drop and push in files here so as of\nnow there are no live objects in my\nobject storage that is in my bucket what\ni can do is i can click on upload files\nand then\ni can choose a location from my machine\nfor example i'll go into data sets and\nwhat i can do is i can choose\nsome of the files here\nin any format\nlet's choose csv or text and just to\nopen so this one will basically upload\nmy data sets here now once i've uploaded\nthe files i can basically close this one\ni can look into options here which says\nedit permissions and edit metadata if\nyou would want to download it if you\nwould want to copy move or rename it if\nyou would want to export to a different\nservice called cloud pub sub which is\npublish subscribing messaging system you\ncan scan the data now you can click on a\nparticular file and that basically shows\nyou the url which basically allows you\nto access this file you can try copying\nthis you can click on download and\ndownload this file you can even try\naccessing this from public and that\nbasically shows you the content of this\nfile based on the permissions so this is\nbasically your object storage which is\none of the service which is offered what\nyou can also do is you can create\nfolders and within folders you can then\nupload your data so this is your google\ncloud\nstorage option which is for your\nobject storage that is you can add\ndifferent items you can give different\npermissions and you can use this google\ncloud platforms storage service offering\nnow you also have other options such as\nbig table and we can go into that by\nclicking here and click on big table so\nbig table is one of the service which\nkickstarted nosql databases today in\nmarket we see different nosql databases\nsuch as cassandra hbase mongodb couchdb\nneo4j and many others so you can\nbasically use bigtable which was the\npioneer when it comes to your no sql\ndatabases or not only sql databases so\nthe problem initially faced by google\nwas that\nthe web indexes\nbehind search engine were taking too\nlong to build so company wanted to build\ndatabase that would provide real-time\naccess to petabytes of data and that's\nwhere bigtable began so big table powers\ndifferent other google services such as\ngmail google maps and other services and\nin 2015\nit was launched as a service for\ncustomers so when it comes to\nscalability with use of bigtable you can\nincrease your machine count without any\ndowntime and you can handle admin tasks\nlike upgrades restarts and so on which\nare basically taken care by the cloud\nprovider data present in cloud bigtable\nis encrypted and you can use im roles to\nspecify access so data written to or\nfrom big table is through data service\nlayers such as managed virtual machines\nhbase rest servers java services hbs\nclient and so on\nhere if i would want to use bigtable i\ncan click on create instance and that\nbasically tells me\ncloud bigtable instance is a container\nfor your clusters now here you can give\nan instance name so for example i will\nsay a u a and then say for example\ntest and let's say big table so that\nwill be the name of instance this will\nbe permanent you can choose the storage\ntype again you can go for lower latency\nmore rows red per second typically used\nfor real-time serving use cases or you\ncan go for sdds which have higher\nlatency for random reads good\nperformance on scans and typically used\nfor batch analytics so let's go for ssds\nas of now here you have cluster id which\nis auto populated you can choose a\nregion so let's go for our favorite one\nhere where i can say europe west 3 i can\nchoose a zone here and i can then choose\nhow many nodes would i want to use for\nmy big table so when you talk about big\ntable service it will have a cluster\nunderlying which will have various nodes\nwhich will control your data throughput\nstorage and rows read per second so as\nof now let it be just one node and\nthat's enough for our demo when we talk\nabout performance it basically tells you\nbased on the current node and storage\ntype it tells you how many reads can\nhappen at milliseconds so it says 10 000\nrows per second at 6 millisecond you\nhave writes which are 10 000 rows per\nsecond or you have scans which are 220\nmegabytes per second storage which is\ntaken care here would be 2.5 terabytes\nand i can then basically click on create\nnow there is also some option called\nreplication guidance which basically\nsays replication for cloud table big\ntable copies your data across multiple\nregions enabling you to isolate workload\nand increase the availability and\ndurability of your data depending on\nyour use case you can have bigtable\nwhich can be used to have your data\nacross regions\nnow you can click on create\nwith all your specifications chosen and\nthat's going to set up a cluster or you\ncan say a fully managed nosql database\nwhich will give you low latency and\nreplication for high availability now\nonce we have a new instance you can\nconnect to it with the cbt command line\ntool and for instructions you can click\non learn more here you can just click on\nthis instance id to see the details\nagain if you would want to look into\nyour big table setup so it tells me here\nthat we have one instance what is the\ncpu utilization time how many rows for\nred or written what is the throughput\nand this is auto populated based on your\nusage you can click on monitoring and\nthat basically will give you different\nwidgets which will display information\nfor your cpu utilization what is your\nhottest node depending on how many nodes\nyou have system errors automatic\nfailovers storage utilization and so on\nyou can click on key visualizer which\nwill allow you to look into your table\nif you have already created some data\nhere and you can click on tables to see\nhow many tables you have added here so\nthat's in brief about your big tables\nwhich is\none thing which we need to remember is\nit's not good for\nall use cases\nso should be used for low latency access\nthat is fast access and good if at least\ndata is greater than one terabyte for\nsmaller amount of data the overhead is\ntoo high so big tables performance will\nsuffer if you store individual elements\nlarger than 10 megabytes\nif you want to store bigger objects such\nas images video files then go for object\nstorage\nand that would be a better option so\nalways remember big table is not a\nrelational database it's a no sql\ndatabase and when you talk about\nmulti-row transactions or online\ntransaction processing bigtable is not\nthe right choice\nso it can be used for wide range of\napplications especially when you talk\nabout your olap that is online\nanalytical processing so it is designed\nto store key value pairs and there can\nbe different use cases so for example if\nyou are using something like cloud data\nflow or cloud data proc\nwhere you would want map reduce kind of\noperations big table can act as a good\nstorage because it has very high\nthroughput and scalability and the best\nthing is that it supports hbase api thus\nallowing easy integration with apache\nhadoop and spark clusters which you can\nbring up using one more service which\ngoogle cloud platform offers which is\ncalled cloud data proc so big table is\ngood for real-time analytics\nit's commonly seen in financial services\niot and others and if you are thinking\nof\nrunning interactive sql then\nbig table would not be the right choice\nbut the other choice would be bigquery\nyou should also remember that this\nhas a cluster running and you would be\ncharged if this cluster kept on running\nso you have to be very careful in your\nfree account when you're using such\nservices now we have clicked on this one\nso i can select this one and basically i\ncan look at the permissions i can look\nat the labels i can look at inherited\npermissions here i can also\nclick on my instance\nwhich we created and either you can edit\nor you can just do a delete so as of now\nwe will just delete this which needs you\nto given that name so we'll say aua test\nb d\nand then click on delete so whenever\nyou're trying out different services the\nfirst approach should be setting up\nthese different services seeing how they\nwork basically trying connecting to them\nand once you are satisfied with the\ninitial test then you can plan your\nactions and come back and use the\nservice for a longer duration now that's\nyour big table which is one of the\nofferings we can go back into storage\nand here you have other options which\nare available so for example we were in\nbig table you also have an option such\nas cloud data store now that's one more\nservice which is offered by google cloud\nplatform when it comes to storage domain\nso google added software on top of big\ntable\nwhich supports more than simple key\nvalue pairs\nwhen you talk about secondary indexes\ninstead of just having one primary index\nwhen you talk about asset properties for\nreliable transactions such as sql query\nlike language\nso these\nfeatures or these services were added to\nor on top of your big table which gave\nbirth to a new service which was\nreleased as cloud data store so this is\nwhere you have cloud data store and you\ncan\nselect a client cloud firestore mode so\nyou can go for a native mode enable all\ncloud firestores features with offline\nsupport or you can go for clouds data\nstore system on top of clouds firestore\nso these are different options here and\nhere we look at the api or scalability\nengine support how many rights it\nsupports and so on you can choose one of\nthese and then you can choose where to\nstore your data so for example if i\nclick on this one then it choose asks me\nto choose a location so it says the\nlocation of your database affect its\ncost availability and durability choose\na regional location lower right latency\nlower cost or multi-region location here\ni can basically choose for example\neurope\nand then i can go ahead and create a\ndatabase so it says initializing cloud\nfirestore in data store mode services in\neu3 this usually takes a few minutes\nyou'll be redirected to your database\nonce it is ready so if we compare the\npricing structure between cloud data\nstore and cloud bigtable always remember\ncloud data store you pay for monthly\nstorage which is also in the case of big\ntable however here you are paying for\nmonthly storage for reads and writes\nbut in case of big table you are paying\nfor cluster when it is running so cloud\ndata store is a good option for small\ndata\ninfrequent access and it acts cheaper\nwhen you talk about large amount of data\nor big data and frequent access then you\nare talking about cloud big table so big\ntable is cheaper when you talk about\nlarger amount of data so here it says\nsince your database is empty you can\nstill switch to cloud firestore in\nnative mode to get more features you\ncould do that you could learn you could\nsay query by gql\nas of now we don't have any data here\nlet's look at the dashboard which says\nsince your database is empty you can\nstill switch to cloud firestore in\nnative mode to get more features so this\nis your cloud data store and it has many\nfeatures\nwhich help you to work with your data\nhowever some features or important\nfeatures of rdbmss were still missing\nand\nthat's where google created\nyet another big table based service\ncalled cloud spanner now we can continue\nworking on cloud data store which\nbasically gives you one option to work\nwith your data\nyou can create an entity\nhere by clicking on create entity and\nthat basically gives you\noptions such as default name space you\ncan give a kind you can give numeric id\nand you can start adding properties but\nto learn more about data store we will\nlearn about this in further session so\nas of now i'm going to click on cancel\ni'm going to go back to my data store\nand this basically\nlet's go to data store option\nor i can go into admin here which\nbasically says if you have entities you\ncan import or export them so let's go\nback and let's again look into storage\noptions\nso as of now we were in data store\nlet's click on this one\nso as i mentioned your cloud data store\nwhich basically gives you some\nadditional features on top of your\nbigtable but what google also did was it\nrealized that there was a need for rdbms\nfeature support that is there were a lot\nof features now here we have created a\ndata store and it says your data base is\nready to go just add data you can create\nentity start putting in data and then\nyou can go ahead and query this so if\nyou would want to learn more about your\ndata store you can just click on this\none and that takes you to the complete\ndocumentation of native mode and data\nstore mode what is firestore in native\nmode what is in data store mode what are\npricing and locations how you choose a\ndatabase mode what are the feature\ncomparisons what you can do what you are\nallowed to do here what programming\nlanguages can be used different regions\npricing and so on as of now we'll click\non this one and let's look at one\nadvanced service which google cloud came\nup with when it comes to your additional\nfeatures of rdbms so google created yet\nanother big table based service called\ncloud spanner now that you might not see\nhere but if you scroll down you should\nbe able to see your cloud spanner\nin the options here\nor did we miss it on the top so let's\nagain look here yeah so it is here and\nyou can click on spanner so cloud\nspanner was released in 2017 it\nbasically supports relational schema so\nit offers strong consistency for all\nqueries which can be sql based you can\nhave multi-region deployment\nnow when it comes to massive scalability\nrequirement and strong consistency cloud\nspanner is a good option so it says\ncloud spanner is a managed mission\ncritical globally consistent and\nscalable relational database so if you\nwould want to use this then you will\nhave to enable this api which shows you\nan option here it says try this api so\nit's a managed service\nso it is one of the google's most\nexpensive database services there is\nalso one more database service which is\ncloud sql which can be used so when we\ntalk about your cloud spanner it is\nfully managed relational database\nservice it is massively distributed\nyou can have millions of machines across\nhundreds of data centers with support\nautomatic sharding and synchronous\nreplication it gives you low latency and\nschema updates without downtime making\ndata high availability and reliability\nso we'll learn about cloud spanner\nwith more details\nlater in other sessions now we can also\ngo back to storage and we can look at\nthe different options which we have here\nso you have object storage you have\nspanner you also have your sql based\nservice which is yet another managed\nservice offered by\ncloud or google cloud i would say so\nthat's called cloud sql so this is\nbasically a service which allows you to\nhave fully managed relational mysql\npostgres and sql server databases google\nhandles replication patch management\ndatabase management and other things\nwhich are related to this managed or\nfully managed database service\nit can allow you to handle terabytes of\nstorage capacity with 40 000\niops with\nhuge amount of ram per instance so you\ncan click on create instance here and\nthen you can choose one of the database\nwhich you would want to use so cloud sql\nis a managed service you can choose one\nof your mysql or postgres and sql server\nsay for example i choose mysql now that\nbasically tells me what is the instance\nid it\nsets up a password you can always change\nthe password you can change the region\nyou can choose your database version and\nthen you can also look at other\nconfiguration options which talk about\nmachine type which will be used what is\nabout your backup and recovery\nmaintenance and all that and if you\nclick on create this will basically\ncreate a fully managed sql service which\ncan allow you to straight away start\nusing mysql on cloud thus allowing you\nto store your relational data when we\ntalk about storage options how can we\nnot talk about a data warehouse solution\nor basically an option which allows you\nto run your queries by directly updating\ndata so you can use a data warehouse\nservice which google cloud platform\noffers and that's called bigquery so\nbasically you can be looking into\nthe\nbig data section here and here you have\nan option called bigquery so this\nbasically brings ease of implementation\nand speed so building your own data with\nhouse can be expensive time consuming\nand difficult to scale so with bigquery\nyou just load data and pay only for what\nyou use so it when it comes to features\nyou have\nfeatures such as capability to process\nbillions of rows in seconds and if you\nwould want to do real time analysis of\nstreaming data that is also possible\nhere so here we have clicked on bigquery\nwhich basically shows you the option\nwhere you can start typing your query\nand test your data access for example if\ni have uploaded some data so\nit shows me there are some queries which\nare saved here now i can schedule your\nquery i can basically choose the format\nof a particular query by clicking on\nthis more\nhere i have an option which says add\ndata so i can pin it to a particular\nproject i can explore public data sets i\ncan create a connection so if i click on\nexplore public data sets then it takes\nme to a page from where you can get\ndifferent kind of data sets which are\nalready available which you can put into\nyour bigquery and start querying your\ndata by default it shows that it is\naligned to my project and i don't need\nto worry about it i can look at saved\nqueries if i have already saved a\nparticular query i can look at job\nhistory i can look at transfers\nscheduled queries and reservations so\nbigquery basically\ninitially had its own version of sql\nwhich was slightly different from\nstandard sql but in 2016 bigquery 2 was\nreleased that supports sql 2011 standard\nyou can always select standard sql\nnow bigquery when it comes to pricing we\nneed to remember that the storage is\nwhere the storage cost is very less here\napproximately 0.02 cents per gb per\nmonth\nit is almost similar to near line where\nyou can also have low cost that is 0.01\ncents per gigabyte per month there is no\ncharge for reading data from storage\nwhen it comes to querying and that's\nwhere the cost is incurred so one\nterabyte per month is free and after\nthat it costs few cents per gigabyte so\nthis is mainly for high volume customers\nthere is a flat rate by pricing which\ncan be used so when you talk about\nquerying you can save your query results\nyou can create data set to store the\nresults now results are put in a temp\ntable in cache\nand after you are done with that you can\ndelete data set and delete all the data\nso when you talk about loading data into\nbigquery you can get the data from cloud\nstorage google drive cloud data store\nstack driver stack uh driver other\noptions you have cloud bigtable or\nother web interfaces so you can download\nfrom url such as csv json avro you can\ncreate data set create table and create\nfrom source by doing a file upload\nso 10 megabyte or less\nfiles can be uploaded using web\ninterface as an option you can also use\ncommand line and then you can start\nworking with\nyour big query\nso\nhere you can also work with streaming\ndata by basically pushing in streaming\ndata into your bigquery which allows you\nto add one record at a time now you\ncould use something like cloud data flow\nwhich\nallows you to use a particular pipeline\nabout cloud data flow we will learn\nlater so you can benefit from different\nfeatures of bigquery and thus use\ngoogle's offering to work on your\nstructured data or i would say data\nwhich suits well in data warehouses\nnow these are some of the storage\nrelated services which google cloud\noffers\nalthough we will learn about using\nbigquery and running\nor uploading some data by creating add\ndata set here\nby say creating connection or\nusing a public data set so as of now i\nhave this you can also access the\ncommand line to work with this but we\nwill learn in detail about bigquery in\nlater sessions now here you can scroll\ndown and you also have an option within\nbig data space and that is your data\nproc so when you talk about data proc\nthis is\nagain a managed service which allows you\nto run spark or hadoop jobs so\nespecially if you are interested in big\ndata workload so for big data processing\nfor machine learning you can always use\ncloud data proc\nthis uses compute engine instances under\nthe hood but takes care of management\nof these instances so it's a it's a\nlayer on top to spin up clusters it's a\nmanaged service it's cheaper pay when\nthe jobs are running only it's fast\nbecause it is integrated with other\ngoogle cloud services you have open\nsource components pre-installed and data\nproc is integrated with yarn to make\ncluster management easier when you talk\nabout data proc you can click on create\ncluster and that basically allows you to\nset up your cluster by choosing a\nparticular region which you would want\nto use for example i'll choose europast4\nhere it tells what kind of machines you\nwould want to use and by default it has\npopulated\nas\nthe machine here which is 4 cpu and 15\ngigabyte now since you might be using a\nfree account let's not go for the high\nend machine let's go for n1 standard 2\nand then you can scroll down it says\nwhat is the primary disk what is the\ndisk type and this one was for your\nmaster machine that is machine which\nwill have the master processes running\nthen you have your\nworker node configuration which tells\nthis will be let's choose a lower end\nmachine and we can choose how many\nworker nodes you would have so it says\nminimum two you can choose the ssds and\ntheir capacity it talks about yarn cores\nand yarn memory which will be allocated\nand here we have\nthen option of clicking on create\nso once you click on create this will\nbasically spin up a cluster wherein you\ncan\nstraight away start submitting jobs to\nthis\nyou can basically go ahead once your\ncluster is ready you can go into the\ncluster you can submit a job you can\nchoose a type which is spark or any\nother application which you would want\nto run and then basically you can use\nthis fully managed service which allows\nyou to run your big data clusters you\ncan obviously control access via roles\nor access control list and you can have\naccess\nas it is at project level or based on\nyour data proc cluster or even at your\nworker notes\nso we'll learn about data proc in later\nsessions so as of now you see here the\ncluster is getting created it says the\ncloud storage bucket which it is using\nis this one now i can click on this and\nopen link in a new tab it still takes me\ninto console but now it is showing me\nthe bucket which is being used by your\ndata proc cluster\nthis is the bucket which is being used\nand it is being used for underlying\nmetadata which gets stored here so you\nlook at the cluster related folders you\ncan click in these folders and then it\ncan see what is the script output what\nit is doing and so on now i can come\nback here to my bucket which will\nbasically show me what kind of buckets\nhave been created so you see data proc\nservice automatically created some\nbuckets which will be holding some data\nyou also have some other buckets which\nwere created based on other services\nwhich we used the access control is fine\ngrained in all cases plus it also shows\nour bucket so underlying it is using\ncompute instances it is basically using\nlet's go here and let's go to compute\nengine and let's look into vm instances\nso data proc which has spun up a cluster\nis also using the vm instances which we\nsee here are running it is using the\nbuckets and it has made a cluster ready\nto use so you can click on this cluster\nand that shows me my cluster related\ndetails if there are any jobs running\nwhat are vm instances what kind of\nconfigurations it has used\nand you can look at different details\nhere you can look at the logs you can\nclick on jobs and that will show you if\nyou have\nbasically run a job on this ready to use\ncluster so it says there is this\nparticular job which was run\nwhich was a spark job you can click on\nsubmit and this one tells you what is\nthe job id what is the region you would\nchoose for example we will again choose\nfor example europe quest 4 it tells what\nis the job type so you can run all these\ntype of jobs in this cluster such as\nhadoop spark pi spark hive pig presto\nyou can give your jar file so if you are\npackaged your application is a jar you\ncan mention that here you can pass in\nsome arguments you can also say some\nother jar files add some properties and\nthen click on submit which will run your\njob on this ready to use cluster now\nsince we have tested it i can basically\ngo ahead and do a delete i don't want to\nincur any cost on these managed services\nwhich are running so there are a lot\nmore information about using these\nservices which google cloud platform\noffers and we can continue learning\nabout these services as we explore your\ngoogle cloud console or even your\ncommand line option now we can come out\nof this one\nby clicking on this menu and then we\nhave other options such as kubernetes\nyou have cloud functions you have your\nnetworking related services monitoring\nrelated services different kind of tools\nwhat you have you have other big data\nspecific services which you can learn\nabout and for each of these servers\ngoogle has a very good documentation\navailable for example when you talk\nabout publish subscribe messaging system\nit is a real-time managed service which\nbasically is a pioneer\nwhich was used and now you have a famous\nservice such as kafka which is being\nused for your publish subscribing or\nmessaging system kind of requirements\nso to conclude about\ngoogle cloud platform services you can\nalways go to\ncloud.google.com and look into the\ndocument section now here you have list\nof different featured products you also\nhave list of your different domains and\nservices which google cloud offers and\nyou can learn about all the different\nservices which are offered by google\ncloud here you can click on featured\nproducts and that basically shows you\ncompute engine cloud run cloud storage\nyou have cloud sql bigquery vision ai\nyou can scroll down and look at your\nartificial intelligence and machine\nlearning related services platform and\naccelerators api management\nso google cloud platform offers\ndifferent services in mainly in your\ncompute storage and databases\nyou have networking related services\nbig data specifics developer tools cloud\nai\nidentity and security\niot management tools api platform and so\non so basically learn about the gcp\nservices which google cloud platform\noffers and in detail you can play around\nwith different services which are\noffered by creating a free account and\nas i demonstrated you can use any one of\nthese services quick start them\nbasically connect to them put in your\ndata or use a managed service to manage\nyour data and benefit from google cloud\nplatform thus\nhaving modernized infrastructure for\nyour different use cases hi guys today\nwe've got something very special in\nstore for you we're going to talk about\nthe best cloud computing platform\navailable amazon web services uh rahul i\nthink you said something wrong here the\nbest cloud computing platform is\nobviously google cloud platform no it\nisn't aws has more than 100 services\nthat span a variety of domains all right\nbut google cloud platform has cheaper\ninstances what do you have to say about\nthat well i guess there's only one place\nwe can actually discuss this a boxing\nring so guys i'm opexa and i will be\ngoogle cloud platform and i'm rahul i'll\nbe aws so welcome to fight night this is\naws versus gcp\nthe winner will be chosen on the basis\nof their origin and the features they\nprovide their performance in the present\nday and comparing them on the basis of\npricing market share and options the\nthings they give you for free and\ninstance configuration now first let's\ntalk about aws aws was launched in 2004\nand is a cloud service platform that\nhelps businesses grow and scale by\nproviding them services in a number of\ndifferent domains these domains include\ncompute database storage migration\nnetworking and so on a very important\naspect about aws is its user experience\nnow aws has been in the market a lot\nlonger than any other cloud service\nplatform which means they know how\nbusinesses work and how they can\ncontribute to the business growing also\naws has over 5.1 billion dollars of\nrevenue in the last quarter this is a\nclear indication of how much faith and\ntrust people have in aws they occupy\nmore than 40 percent of the market which\nis a significant chunk of the cloud\ncomputing market they have at least 100\nservices that are available at the\nmoment which means just about every\nissue that you have can be solved with\nan aws service now that was great but\nnow can we talk about gcp i hope you\nknow that gcp was launched very recently\nin 2011 and it is already helping\nbusinesses significantly with a suite of\nintelligent secure and flexible cloud\ncomputing services it lets you build\ndeploy and scale applications websites\nservices on the same infrastructure as\ngoogle the intuitive user experience\nthat gcp provides with dashboards\nwizards is way better in all the aspects\ntcp has just stepped in the market and\nit is already offering a modest number\nof services and the number is rapidly\nincreasing and the cost for a cpu\ninstance or regional storage that gcp\nprovides is a whole lot cheaper and you\nalso get a multi-regional cloud storage\nnow what do you have to say on that i'm\nso glad you asked let's look at present\nday in fact let's look at the cloud\nmarket share of the fourth quarter of\n2017. this will tell you once and for\nall that aws is the leader when it comes\nto cloud computing amazon web services\ncontributes 47\nof the market share others like\nrackspace or verizon cloud contribute 36\nmicrosoft azure contributes 10 percent\nthe google cloud platform contributes\nfour percent and ibm software continues\nthree percent 47 of the market share is\ncontributed by aws you need me to\nconvince you any more wait wait wait all\nthat is fine but we only started a few\nyears back and have already grown so\nmuch in such a less span of time haven't\nyou heard the latest news our revenue is\nalready a billion dollars per quarter\nwait for a few more years and the world\nshall see and aws makes 5.3 billion\ndollars per quarter it's going to take a\ngood long time before you can even get\nclose to us yes yes we'll see now let's\ncompare a few things for starters let's\ncompare pricing for aws a computer\ninstance of two cpus in 8gb ram costs\napproximately 68 us dollars now a\ncomputer instance is a virtual machine\nin which you can specify what operating\nsystem ram or storage you want to have\nfor cloud storage it costs 2.3 cents per\ngb per month with aws you really want to\ndo that because gcp wins this hands down\nlet's take the same compute instance of\ntwo cpus with 8 gb ram it will cost\napproximately 50 dollars per month with\ngcp and as for my calculations that's a\n25 percent annual cost reduction when\ncompared to aws talking about cloud\nstorage costs it is only 2 cents per gb\nper month with gcp what else do you want\nme to say let's talk about market share\nand options now aws is the current\nmarket leader when it comes to cloud\ncomputing now as you remember we\ncontribute at least 47 percent of the\nentire market share aws also has at\nleast 100 services available at the\nmoment which is a clear indication of\nhow well aws understands businesses and\nhelps them grow yeah that's true but you\nshould also know that gcp is steadily\ngrowing we have over 60 services that\nare up and running as you can see here\nand a lot more to come it's only a\nmatter of time when we will have as many\nservices as you do many companies have\nalready started adopting gcp as a cloud\nservice provider now let's talk about\nthings you get for free with aws you get\naccess to almost all the services for an\nentire year with usage limits now these\nlimits include an hourly or by the\nminute basis for example with amazon ec2\nyou get 750 hours per month you also\nhave limits on the number of requests to\nservices for example with aws lambda you\nhave 1 million requests per month now\nafter these limits across you get\ncharged standard rates with gcp you get\naccess to all cloud platform products\nlike firebase the google maps api and so\non you also get 300 in credit to spend\nover a 12 month period on all the cloud\nplatform products and interestingly\nafter the free trial ends you won't be\ncharged unless you manually upgrade to a\npaid account now there is also the\nalways free version for which you will\nneed an upgraded billing account here\nyou get to use a small instance for free\nand 5 gb of cloud storage any usage\nabove this always free usage limits will\nbe automatically billed at standard\nrates now let's talk about how you can\nconfigure instances with aws the largest\ninstance that's offered the 128 cpus and\n4 tvs of ram now other than the on\ndemand method like i mentioned before\nyou can also use spot instances now\nthese are the situations where your\napplication is more fault tolerant and\ncan handle an interruption now you pay\nfor the spot price which is effective at\na particular r now these spot prices do\nfluctuate but are adjusted over a period\nof time the largest instance offered\nwith google cloud is 160 cpus and 3.75\ntbs ram like spot instances of aws\ngoogle cloud offers short-lived compute\ninstances suitable for bad jobs and\nfault tolerant workloads they are called\nas preemptable instances so these\ninstances are available at 80\noff on on demand price hence they've\nreduced your compute engine costs\nsignificantly and unlike aws these come\nat a fixed price google cloud platform\nis a lot more flexible when it comes to\ninstance configuration you simply choose\nyour cpu and ram combination of course\nyou can even create your own instance\ntypes this way before we wrap it up\nlet's compare on some other things as\nwell telemetry it's a process of\nautomatically collecting periodic\nmeasurements from remote devices for\nexample gps gcp is obviously better\nbecause they have superior telemetry\ntools which help in analyzing services\nand providing more opportunities for\nimprovement when it comes to application\nsupport aws is obviously better since\nthey have years of experience under\ntheir bed aws provides the best support\nthat can be given to the customers\ncontainers are better with gcp a\ncontainer is a virtual process running\nin user space as kubernetes was\noriginally developed by google gcp has\nfull native support for the tools other\ncloud services are just fine tuning a\nway to provide kubernetes as a service\nalso the containers help with\nabstracting applications from their\nenvironment they originally running the\napplications can be deployed easily\nregardless of their environment when it\ncomes to geographies aws is better since\nthey have a head start of a few years\naws in this span of time has been able\nto cover a larger market share and\ngeographical locations now it's time for\nthe big decision so who's it going to be\nyeah who is it going to be gcp or aws i\nthink i'm going to go for choosing the\nright cloud computing platform is the\ndecision that's made on the basis of the\nuser or the organization's requirement\non that note i believe it's time for us\nto wrap this video up we hope you guys\nenjoyed this video and learned something\nnew that aws is better right no that\nchoosing a platform entirely depends on\nyou and your organization's requirement\nhello everyone welcome to this session\non google cloud platform website hosting\nand let's understand what google cloud\nplatform offers when it comes to your\nweb hosting requirements\nhere\nwe will learn about google cloud web\nhosting\nsome basics of cloud computing\nweb hosting service providers what is\ngcp and why go for it\ndifferent types of web hosting which are\npossible a use case such as lush\nand a quick hands-on on using gcp for\nweb hosting\nwhen you talk about cloud web hosting\ngoogle cloud has the feature of hosting\na secure and reliable websites easily\nit ensures customers and sites\nprotection the website is a is\nhosted on a fast and reliable network\nyou can do more work for less price with\ngoogle cloud\nnow when we talk about google cloud it\nis always good to know some basics over\ncloud computing\nnow when we talk about cloud computing\ncloud computing is basically using\nresources which are provided by your\ncloud service provider such as google\ncloud and cloud computing basically\nmeans using hardware and software\ncomponents to deliver a service on a\nnetwork now here users can access\nfiles applications from any device\nthat can access internet so when we talk\nabout\ncloud computing this is basically using\nservices which are hosted on the\ninfrastructure managed by cloud provider\nwhen we talk about resources which can\nbe used that may include\nbig data services storage options your\ncomputing options networking options and\nvarious other services which a cloud\nprovider offers\ncloud computing has various different\nservice models such as you have platform\nas a service\nsoftware as a service infrastructure as\na service also these days we talk about\ncontainers as a service\nand these are your different computing\nservice models which are being offered\nby cloud service providers which allow\nyou for automatic integration with your\nexisting environment or if you would\nwant to benefit from modernization by\nusing a cloud providers infrastructure\nyou have different services which are\noffered some of them are for auto\nsoftware integration\nor migration\nbacking up and restoring data\nscaling your storage capacity that is\ngoing for an unlimited storage capacity\nand using a resource provided by cloud\nservice provider benefiting from\nreliability cost efficiency which is\noffered by a cloud provider in this case\nwe are talking about google cloud when\nyou talk about web hosting service\nproviders there are various web hosting\nservice providers you have aws\nyou have squarespace ibm cloud godaddy\nbluehost and google cloud\nso what is gcp and why go for it\nwhen you talk about gcp or as we call it\nas google cloud platform it is set of\ncloud computing services provided by\ngoogle that runs on the same\ninfrastructure that google uses for it\nend user products like youtube gmail and\nmuch more\nwhen you talk about gcp there are\nvarious reasons why anyone would choose\nit for their use cases now let's look at\nsome reasons when you talk about pricing\ngcp has better pricing compared to its\ncompetitors depending on the services\nwhich you would use whether that would\nbe infrastructure as a service such as\nusing compute engine instances and\nrunning your applications on them or\nmight be a managed service such as data\nproc\nor bigtable or your bigquery where you\ncan have your hadoop clusters running or\nstore huge amount of data or even build\nyour data warehouse wherein you can\nstore structured data so there are\ndifferent services with gcp offers and\npricing has been a better option in case\nof google in comparison to other\ncompetitors\nwhen you talk about speed and\nperformance it's very fast and increases\nthe performance of your project if you\nuse different services offered by google\nwhen you talk about live migration of\napps this is one of the features which\norganizations usually like which none of\nother competitors are offering when it\ncomes to live migration of apps so there\nare specific features for example when\nyou talk about compute engine there is a\nfeature stating live migration wherein\nyour resources or your instances which\nare running applications would be\nmigrated during say maintenance from one\nunderlying host to another underlying\nhost without affecting your\napplication's performance\nand you can benefit from that\nwhen you talk about big data google\ncloud has various offerings in big data\nspace and that's one of the advantages\nof gcp in comparison to other\ncompetitors you have different services\nfor your big data needs such as pub sub\nfor publish subscribing messaging system\nor going for data proc which basically\nallows you to spin up your hadoop and\nspark clusters to run your different\njobs and so on so when we talk about\nfeatures of google cloud platform it\noffers high productivity because you are\nusing the resources which are based on\nthe same infrastructure which google\nuses for its own different use cases\nyou can work from anywhere provided you\nhave internet connection and you can\nconnect to the cloud platform and use\ndifferent services offered via web you\ncan quickly collaborate with different\nteams or different colleagues working on\ndifferent projects which might be\nsharing or using different gcp resources\nyou are benefiting from high security\nand different encryption and security\nmechanisms with gcp offers now there are\nfewer sources or you could say data\nwhich is stored or vulnerable devices\nthere is high reliability flexibility or\nscalability which gcp offers\nand the cost effectiveness really makes\nit as a good choice when you would want\nto benefit from infrastructure\nmodernization and using a cloud platform\nsolution for your use case\nnow when you talk about different types\nof web hosting\ngoogle cloud offers three types of web\nhosting\nyou have wordpress now it is a free and\nopen source content management system\nyou might have used in past or have\nheard about wordpress where a lot of\nwebsites are being created it is a\npopular web publishing platform to\neasily set up blogs and websites and\nthus used by organizations or even\nindividual users for having their blogs\nor running their websites or promoting\ntheir products\nyou have lamp which stands for linux\napache mysql and php\nand lampstack consists of linux apache\nhttp server mysql and php and is used to\nhost websites and web applications\nyou also have your option of building\nyour own website so you can develop\nwebsite or web application with your own\ncode directly on compute engine now\nlet's look at a use case and understand\nwhat happened here when we talk about\nlush so\nlush was founded in 1995 it's you might\nhave seen this brand somewhere in the\nstreets it is a global cosmetics\nretailer headquartered in uk it sells a\ndiverse range of fresh handmade products\nlush had become a global brand with over\n930 stores in 49 countries so the\nchallenges which were faced here was\ntraffic on boxing day caused website\ncrash for almost 18 hours and this is\nsomething which had a devastating effect\non their business\nthe previous platform had no scalability\noption what was the solution the\nmovement of website during the peak time\nwas easy due to flexibility of gcp\nplatform with rapid vm deployment on\ngoogle compute engine the environments\nwere monitored and destroyed in minutes\nso the team could test and deploy at\nspeed by using google cloud sql lush\ntook complete control of its\ninfrastructure and optimized its systems\nfor effective scaling overall the\nplatform resulted in lower cost that led\nto a bright future for lush cosmetics\nnow what was the result of all this\nthe availability during peak loads was\nimproved because of google compute\nengines auto scaling feature the\ninfrastructure hosting costs were\nreduced by 40 percent streamline data\ncenter usage from 5 to 3 with google's\nhigh quality private network really\nbenefited lush and it provided a\nflexible architecture and scalability\nfor future business growth now what we\nhave seen here is that your google cloud\nand its web hosting basically offers\nusers to run their websites or use a web\nhosting solution that can benefit in\nmore than one way the simplest approach\ncould be seen is by clicking and setting\nup a vm instance by going to your\nconsole for example if we go in to the\ngoogle cloud platform clicking on\nconsole\nand here the easiest way i could test it\nis by\ngoing to my compute engine\nvm instances and here i can spin up an\ninstance i can click on create now in my\nprevious sessions i have also explained\nabout how you could create a template\nand run an instance from that we can\nalso click on new vm instance let's call\nit new instance\ni will choose a region\nfor example frankfurt i will let it be\ngeneral purpose machines let this\nmachine be one virtual cpu core and 3.75\ngigabyte ram if i am looking for a\nheavier website which might have more\nusers logging in and so on then i can\nchoose a higher configuration machine\nhere we have the option to choose our\ndistribution so for example i can choose\nubuntu and then i can choose a\ndistribution version so it let it be\n16.04\nwe can choose the disk size to be 20\ngigabyte and we can use ssds or hdds so\nas of now it is standard persistent disk\nthat is hdd and that should be enough\nlet's click on select\nhere i will say allow default access i\nwould say allow http and https\nso that if i have a website content\nhosted on this machine i can access it\nover http now here you have management\noptions for your instance you have\nsecurity option which basically allows\nyou to provide a public key if you are\ninterested in using an external ssh\nclient to connect now i have used\nputtygen and i have already created a\nprivate key which is here i have also\nconverted that as a pem file and anytime\nif i would want to use this key all i\nneed to do is click on puttygen where i\nhad earlier created this ppk file now i\ncan just do a load and i can choose the\nkey which i have here\nand i can give the pass face click on ok\nand that shows you the public key let's\ncopy the public key from here let's go\ninto our instance and i can give this\nhere that resolves the name so i have\nthe private key saved on my machine and\npublic key which will be pushed into the\nmachine i can click on create and that\nshould create my instance to which you\ncan connect using ssh from the console\nitself or using a external client such\nas putty which will then need the public\nip of this instance the ppk file what we\nhave and you can connect to this\ninstance what i can also do is i can\njust do a simple ssh from here and that\nwill basically allow me to connect to\nthe instance\nwhat we also need to remember is each\ninstance what we create in compute is\nalso having some default firewall rules\nnow i have connected to my instance i\ncan click on sudo su i can login as root\nand here if i would want i can install a\nparticular service so let's say apache\nlet's say apt get install and then i can\nsay apache 2 or httpd that is basically\nto host your web application\nso i'm installing this service\nand here i can check if the service is\nrunning by doing a service httpd\nstatus or i can say service\napache 2 status it says it is already\nrunning that means the apache web server\npage will be accessible from http\nprovided my firewall rules allow that\nnow before we look into this we can also\nfor our instance look at the firewall\nrules so here you have network details\nnow since we created an instance by\ndefault google has created some firewall\nrules which allow default http https\nicmp your default internal access rdp\nand ssh access and here it says\nthese ingress rules which allow incoming\ntraffic are allowed from anywhere we can\ncustomize that as specific ip addresses\nwe can also look at egress which is\nbasically outgoing traffic and this is\nagain saying my machine can connect to\nthe external world in different ways\nusing different protocols so you can\ncustomize these firewall rules as of now\ni am going to let it be default now we\nconnected to our instance from the\nbrowser and we were basically checking\nhow you can use this browser by clicking\non this now what i can also do is here\ni'm logged into the instance my apache\nserver is running so the best way to\ncheck if\nthe apache web server is accessible via\nhttp\nall i need is my\npublic\nip so let's copy this let's go here and\ni will say http\nslash\njust give your public ip and that shows\nyour apache to web server page that\nmeans the apache service has already\nbeen run\nnow here it tells if you would want to\nhost a particular page\nwhat you will have to do is\nas it says here it is based on\nequivalent page on dbn from which ubuntu\napache packaging is derived if you can\nread this page it means apache http\nserver is installed at this site is\nworking properly now you can replace\nthis file located at var www.html\nindex.html before continuing to operate\nyour http server so this is where you\ncan change the particular page and you\nwill be able to host your web site on\nthis particular ec2 instance what we can\ndo is we can check this so we can go\ninto the browser\nand we can look in var\nwww and that has an html folder\nlook into this and as of now you have a\nindex dot html and that basically is the\npage what we are seeing now i can click\non this one and i can see i have a small\nhtml page which is basically showing me\nwhat we are seeing on our web server\nwhat i can also do is for now i can test\nit out and i can put in a different html\npage and see how that works\nso we had basically the page here\nin var\nwww\nand then we had the html folder\nand in html folder\nwhat i had was this index file so as of\nnow i just moved it and i put it in a\ndifferent location so if i look in my\nhome hdu\nindex.html\nthat shows me the complete html page\nwhat we were seeing on our web server\nand here it shows you what this page\nwould display if you run it\non your http it says apache 2 ubuntu\ndefault page\nit shows it works it shows the content\nand so on so for just testing i moved\nthis page out from this location and\nwhat i did was i added a different page\nhere so that\npage\nif you look in html and then look in my\npage dot html section i've just added\nsome basic details of creating html i'm\nsaying body i'm using marquee\nand then i'm closing this with html tag\nnow this is a simple html page which i\ncreated\nand now what i did was once i've done\nthis i basically did a service apache\nrestart so once you do that it will take\nup your new page\nand once you have done that now you can\naccess that\nby going to\nyour http\ngiven your details\nand then basically give your public ip\nwhich we can get from here\nand just paste it here now hit on this\nso that shows me there is a mypage.html\ni can click on this and that basically\nshows the symbol page which i created so\nas of now\nthis is my web page which i have created\nand\nthis is hosted on my compute instance\nnow obviously we can create a more\ncomplex website\nbacked up by a database use php use\nmysql to store the data and then host\nyour website on a google cloud platform\nservice such as compute where your\nactual code is running so we can learn\nabout your web hosting on compute\ninstances in further sessions\nare you in the analytics space\nhave you ever wondered how data\nprocessing in the cloud is changing the\nanalytic
