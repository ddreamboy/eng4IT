  "text": "We are living in the future.\nOK, there are fewer flying cars, \nmoon colonies and jetpacks\nthan I imagined when I was ten,\nbut we’re still surrounded by technology \nwhich pretty recently seemed like\nit could only exist in the \nrealm of science-fiction.\nAnd the most prominent example of this \nis computers we can talk to.\nSpeech recognition has come a long way \nsince its first incarnation in 1952,\nbut progress has been surprisingly slow.\nMoving from recognising individual words\nto full sentences took about 20 years,\nand honing that process to the point\nwhere it could be brought to the \nconsumer market took almost another 20.\nBut with modern advances in computing\npower, things have sped up a lot,\nand the launch of Google’s \nVoice Search in 2011,\nand Apple’s Siri shortly afterwards,\nsignalled the beginning of \na new era for this technology\n- an era that is now in full swing.\nIt’s estimated that as of 2020\nthere are as many as 4.2 billion voice \nassistant devices being used worldwide,\nand that number is expected \nto reach 8 billion by 2023.\nBut their increased ubiquity \nand improved computing power\ndoesn’t mean a free ticket \nto unlimited progress -\nthere are still a number of significant \nchallenges facing this technology.\nBut before we talk about those,\nwe first need to know \nhow speech recognition works.\nThis is a spectrogram:\na visual representation of the frequency \ncontent over time in an audio recording.\nThis audio recording.\nThe brighter the colour,\nthe higher the concentration \nof that particular frequency.\nFor example, if I make a SSSS sound,\nyou can see the concentration \nof higher frequencies here.\nAnd if I make an OOOO sound, you can see \nthis blob of lower frequencies here.\nLinguists have been using spectrograms \nto analyse human speech for years,\nlearning to recognise \nT’s, B’s, S’s, vowel sounds,\nand even tell what someone is saying \njust from looking at the image.\nThis is how speech recognition works.\nThe computer splits the image up into \nslices, analyses each slice\nand compares it to a library of what it \nknows different sounds normally look like.\nIt then works what sound \nthat slice is most likely to be\nand moves onto the next one.\nWhat’s especially smart though\nis that it also factors in the \nanalysis of previous slices,\nmaking judgements based on \nhow words tend to be constructed.\nFor example, if it’s \n90% certain this a K sound,\nit’s far more likely that this is going \nto be an A or an O than a J or a P.\nNow, looking at this process, it's easy\nto see why progress has taken some time.\nMost humans wouldn’t have a hard time\nhearing the difference\nbetween the phrases\n“Hi, I’m Adam” and \n“Hi Madam” for example\n- we have a lifetime of experience.\nBut the spectrograms for those two phrases\nare going to look pretty similar.\nAnd while modern services use \nmachine learning to train themselves\non every new piece of audio they receive, \nthey haven’t caught up yet.\nStill, the most advanced speech \nrecognition systems today\nhave got down to an error rate \nof around 11%, which is pretty impressive.\nSo... what’s the problem?\nWell it turns out that understanding what \nyou’ve said is only half the battle.\nThe really tough bit is \nworking out what you meant.\nIf I were to say “I closed the window \nin my room because it was too cold.”\nmost people would\nunderstand what I mean is\n“My room was too cold, \nso I closed the window”.\nBut “it” is ambiguous in that \nfirst sentence -\ntechnically I could be saying\n“The window was too cold, so I closed it”.\nHumans understand the relationship\nbetween a cold room and an open window,\nand that the phrase “it’s too cold”\nrefers to our general surroundings,\nand that the temperature of a window \nis no reason to close it.\nSo we deduce the intended \nmeaning fairly easily.\nComputers don’t have any of \nthat pre-existing knowledge,\nwhich makes a sentence like that \nvery difficult to interpret.\nThis kind of phrase is \nknown as a Winograd Schema,\nnamed for professor Terry Winograd who \nfirst addressed this issue in 1972,\nand while this is only \nthe tip of the iceberg\nwhen it comes to the problems computers \nhave understanding natural speech,\nit does touch on the \nchallenges that still lie ahead.\nAnd those challenges \naren’t only technical.\nThere's the ethics involved\nin large companies\nusing your voice \nrecordings to enhance their AIs,\nand making profit from the \ndata sets they collect.\nPlus, there’s the problem of trust -\nmany people still feel uneasy about \nwelcoming these devices into their homes.\nHow these issues will play out in the \nfuture remains to be seen.\nBoth Amazon and Google have publicly \nsaid that their speech recognition systems\nare inspired by, and \naspire to one day emulate,\nthe Star Trek dream:\na computer that understands \nnatural speech, and responds in kind.\nAnd while no one is yet close \nto realising that dream,\nin a time when machine learning \nand AI are constantly redefining the\nboundaries of what’s possible, it might \nnot be that long before it’s in reach.\n",
