  "text": "hey guys welcome to testing universe\nin this video we are going to understand\nabout software development lifecycle\nin our introductory video about what is\nsoftware testing\nwe have understood about software but\nwe have to understand now how exactly we\nare going to\nbuild a software right so to\ndevelop any software software\ndevelopment life cycle\nis an approach we have to follow right\nso what exactly is this particular\nsoftware development life cycle\nhow exactly it will guide us you know in\ndeveloping a software\nwe will try to understand everything in\ndetail about this\nso what is software development life\ncycle\nit's a systematic and step-by-step\napproach to develop a software you will\nbe having a systematic\nas well as different steps will be there\nright\nwith that approach we are going to\ndevelop a software\nso software development life cycle it\ndescribes\ndifferent phases involved in the\ndevelopment process\nif you want to develop anything right\nyou will be having\nyou are you will be you know dividing\nthat particular\nentire development into different phases\nright or different steps we can consider\nfor now\nright once we go in detail about this\nyou will understand about what are these\ndifferent phases\nit describes different you know steps\ninvolved in the development process and\nit also you know\ngives the detailed roles involved in\neach phase\nmeans okay step one i'm doing something\nin that what all roles roles in the\nsense what are\nwhich all persons which are you know\ninvolved\nand what are those that person roles\nright it this entire software\ndevelopment life cycle will give you\na detailed overview of uh\nhow exactly you know you are going to\napproach to develop a software\nand then who are all involved in that\nparticular uh\nyou know approach right so\nwe'll go ahead and understand right what\nare those phases\nright you can see here in this diagram\nthese are the different\nphases which are involved in developing\na software\nso what are these phases the first phase\nis requirement phase\nthe second phase is analysis phase third\nphase is design phase\nfourth phase is development phase fifth\nphase is testing\nsixth phase is deployment and then\nseventh\nphase is maintenance okay we'll\nunderstand about all these phases in\ndetail\nright but you can see here what is this\nrequirement we have to go\nin detail about this and this is one\nphase or one step\nright and then overall involved right in\nthis particular phase\nso before we go in detail and understand\nlike how exactly you know we are going\nto\napproach all these different phases we\nwill take\na a day-to-day uh activity\nwhich will be done by most of the human\nbeings right\njust to give a broader picture or just\nto give\nan overview of how exactly you know it\nis\nit has similarities to develop a\nsoftware\ni am going to you know take an example\nof\nright constructing a house or\nconstructing\nan apartment or anything right so we\nwill take up that example\nthat's a generic example i am going to\ntake so that you will understand\nyou will understand what exactly you\nknow a person will do\nwhile constructing a house so similarly\nwe will apply the same rules\nuh in software development right so if i\nif i want to construct a house okay uh\nlet me\nlet me just go in detail about this\nright i want to\nyou know construct a house so i will be\nhaving certain\nrequirements my own requirements to\nconstruct a house right\nso what are those requirements first\nfirst i will\nyou know tell i need i want to construct\na house\nwith three bedrooms\nand three\nbathrooms and i want to have\na nice right garden\nin front\nand whatever this three bedroom this\nhouse should be a\nduplex house\nokay and i need to have a nice garden i\nneed\na you know car parking\nspace for two cars\nokay we can we can consider it as big\ncars\ntwo big cars and then i i want to have\na parking space\nfor two bikes\njust just you know there might be a\nnumber of requirements i'm just\nyou know giving you with these\nrequirements we're giving you an\noverview okay so let's let's\nuh you know consider a person by name\nxyz right\nor we can we can also take it take him\nas tom\nright tom wants to construct a house\nwith these requirements\nso what he will do he will either\napproach\nan individual you know a builder\nhe he might approach an individual\nbuilder\nor a company he might approach\nuh an individual builder or a company\nokay let's say he has he has approached\na company right and then he will say\nright these are my requirements i want\nto construct my house\ni have a plot of 60\nby 40 right in this i want to construct\na duplex house with all these\nrequirements okay so this is called a\nrequirement\nphase means tom tom\nif you consider the company this company\nor individual\nwill be a developer okay or a construct\nconstruction company or you can consider\nthem as a builder or developer\nokay you can consider them as a builder\nor a developer\nand this particular term will be a\nclient to this builder or developer\nhe will be a client to these builders so\nthe client is going to approach the\ndeveloper or the development company or\nthe builder company\nto develop a house\nwith all these requirements okay he will\ngive the requirements\nso from from this company or from\nif he is an individual builder any any\none person\nokay will be assigned and that person\nfor example by name henry\nokay he is going to gather the\nrequirements he is going to\ntake all the requirements of the tom and\nthen what he will do\nhe will analyze all these requirements\nokay okay tom i can\nuh you know come up with uh some design\nfor you\ni can come up with some design for you\nso he will what he will do\nsince the there from the builder company\nthey are going to give the design how\nexactly the design would be\nthe design would be like uh\nthe architecture\nright the design would be the\narchitecture\nor the you know high level\nhigh level details about the house\nwhich means they will give it a diagram\nin such a way that okay\nthe entrance will come here the uh you\nknow sit out will come here the hall\nwill come here\nlike that a bigger picture\nalong with that they will you know give\nyou\na 3d model\nwhich is the detailed design\nwhich is a detailed design\nwhat is this detailed design okay in the\nhall what all you know\nmy new details will be there that level\nof detailing will be given in this\nparticular 3d model\nokay so this is called this is called\nright low level or\ndetailed design\nis called low level or details means in\ndetail everything will be explained\nin this is this is a high level\narchitecture okay this is how it looks\nand then in detail uh each and every uh\nyou know room each and every\nuh requirement will be considered so\nafter\nafter uh you know giving all these\ndesign if\nif you are okay with the design you will\ntell the company\nright okay i'm okay with the design\nlet's start building the house\notherwise if you need any modifications\nyou will say no no\ni need some changes in this particular\nyou know design\nso you can make those changes so that we\ncan go ahead with the\nconstruction so let's say you you have\nyou know\ncome to an agreement okay i am i'm okay\nwith this particular\ndesign let's uh you know start the\nconstruction\nso the henry's role\ngathering the requirement will be over\nonce henry gathers the requirement the\ndesign and everything will be done by\nsome other person\nokay there will be a separate team for\ndesigning\ndesign team they will give you the\ndesign\ndesign team will give you the design\nonce that is done\nthere will be a different set of people\nright to construct the house\nokay\nto construct the house different set of\npeople will be there okay\nso\nconstruction engineers and\nworkers let's take this right so\nas soon as uh they start the\nconstruction right there will be lot of\nagreements okay this this is the pricing\nand all those details will be considered\nand then once everything\nis agreed the you know construction of\nthe house will start\nand then once the construction starts\nokay at the design phase you might\nbe having certain uh you know ideas but\nwhen the\nconstruction of the house starts you\nmight uh you know\nas as and when the progress goes you\nmight come up with\ndifferent ideas also if the there is an\nagreement between uh\nyou know the client and the uh\ncompany right or the developer then only\nthey\nare going to allow the changes otherwise\nas per the design the construction will\nhappen once the construction is complete\nit will be handed over to the it will be\nhanded over to the\nclient right so that's how we are going\nto construct our house means\nif if i want to construct a house also i\nam following a\nstep by step approach in a similar\nfashion if i want to develop any\nsoftware\nwe have to follow a step-by-step\napproach\nto develop a software so what exactly\nwill happen in each and\nyou try to you know analyze whatever i\nhave given as an example for the\nconstruction company\nbecause that that will remain in a\nin your day-to-day life you will be\ndoing or you will be seeing all those\nactivities\nand you can compare the same thing with\nthese particular requirements okay\nso let's understand everything in detail\nabout this particular software\ndevelopment life cycle\nthe first phase is requirement phase in\nthis phase what happens\nbusiness analyst collects requirements\nfrom client\nor customer and documents the\nrequirement\nwhich is called business requirement\nspecification document\nokay the role is business and list the\nbusiness analyst from\nfrom the you know development company\nwill\nsit with the client or customer there\nwill be an individual\nor maybe group of people from the\ncustomer end\nand the business analyst will meet\ntogether\nand then the client will explain all his\nrequirements\nto the business analyst and then after\nyou know collecting all the requirements\nof the client\nbusiness and list will create a document\nwhich is called business requirement\nspecification document\nwhich is brs or it can also be called as\nuh customer requirement specification\ndocument\nright so that is the requirement phase\nso what what client will do uh\nin this particular phase right we will\ntake an example of a\nreal world software application and then\nwe try to understand that\nokay so the role involved in this\nparticular\nphase is business analyst and\nthe outcome of this particular phase is\nbusiness requirement specification\ndocument\nokay so that's about a requirement phase\nso what is what are these requirements\nright let's take one example of\ninventory and billing software\nright in this particular what is this\ninventory and billing software i\ni for example i am a company who sells\nmobile phones right i want to maintain\nmy stock and then whenever a phone is\nsold\nwhenever a phone is you know sold i have\nto you know build that particular\ncustomer who is buying it and then my\ninventory uh you know our stock should\nbe reduced\nthat kind of you know it's a billing\nsoftware which is a\nyou know which is also called as point\nof sale software\nwhich is very common uh you know you\nwill\ncommonly you will see across uh you know\nall the\nindustries right so what is this what is\nthis\nin this the client will say i need i\nwant to maintain my inventory\ni want to you know bill and generate the\ninvoice to the customer\nand then not only one user multiple\nusers will generate the\nbill at a time for example if you go to\nany shopping mall\nor if you're going to go to supermarket\nthere will not be only one\ncounter but multiple billing counters\nwill be there but the software is one\neach and every billing counter one\nperson will be sitting and he will be\nhaving separate\nuh you know login soft separate username\nand password\nto that particular software to bin\nright so that's the requirement and need\nstock and financial reports means stock\nmeans\nokay how many are sold how many are uh\nyou know available in my\ninventory or in my go down and then how\nmany uh\nnot today how much money i have\ngenerated\nit might be a daily basis it might be\nmonthly basis or yearly basis whatever\ndate the customer selects\nyou should be able to generally generate\nthe financial reports also\nokay so this is the requirement is given\nby the customer\nuh to the business unless okay\nwe will go in each and every phase we\nwill take\nthis inventory and billing software and\nwe'll try to analyze\nright how exactly you know a software\nwill be filled the next phase is\nanalysis phase\nokay the requirement is given by the\nclient\nbut whether it is feasible to develop\nall the requirements given by the\ncustomer or client or not\nthat analysis will be done okay analysis\nand\nfeasibility study of the requirement is\ndone\nnot every requirement will be you know\nconverted into a software\nthere will be there will be uh you know\nsome restrictions also\nright while developing the software\nbecause customer\non his day-to-day basis whatever he does\nin his uh you know a store\nor in his supermarket or wherever it is\nhe is going to\nexplain that to the business analyst but\nnot all the you know requirements\ncan be we can always fulfill all the\nrequirements or\nthere might be some restrictions in\nfulfilling all the requirements so\nwe have to do a feasibility study of all\nthe requirements\nright and we have to analyze the\nrequirement and we have to do\nfeasibility study of the\nrequirement once that is done so who\nare all going to you know do this\nparticular\nfeasibility study so you can see here\nbusiness analyst because he is the\nperson\nwho has uh who is interacting with the\ncustomer so business analyst and then\nthe project managers right so these\nthese people are uh\nyou know from the development team and\nthen different team leads\nand it it all depends on the company but\nthese are the main\nuh you know roles which will always be\ninvolved in\nanalyzing the requirements once they\nanalyze the requirements so they will\nthey will filter out okay i can i can we\ncan\ndevelop this particular software for\nthese requirements\nright a detailed software requirement\nare documented so whatever orally\nuh the requirements given by the client\nit is it\nit will it will not be you know properly\nyou know designed uh\nto develop a software so there will be a\ndocument which\nwhich is generated which is called\nsoftware requirement specification\ndocument\nby these people right so in this phase\nuh what happens we are going to\nwrite a software requirement\nspecification document along with\nanalyzing the and of doing the\nfeasibility study of the requirement\nso the outcome is software requirement\nspecification document so what is this\nsoftware\nyou can see here this is how the\nsoftware requirement specification uh\nyou know\nwill be detailed out for a billing\nsoftware let's say\ni want to have a login page and its\nfunctionalities like username password\nneeds to be entered if wrong password is\nentered\nyou know you need to show the error\nmessage all those detailing will be\nwritten there and then customer told\nmultiple users\nuh you know needs to log in and build\nthe software so\nwe need to have a module we can we will\ncall\nuh you know these things as modules\nright user management\nwe need to have user management like add\nuser\nupdate user delete user if they knew the\ncompany they have to delete the user\nright update the user if\nif they have entered wrong data they\nwant to update the user\nright well while uh adding the user you\nneed to create their username password\nand all those things all these detailing\nwere not given by the client in the\nrequirement phase\nright so these kind of detailing would\nbe written by the\nwritten in the software requirement\nspecification document so similarly\nproduct management\nright in the product management you will\nbe having category and sub category\nright in the in the smartphones you\nmight be having uh you know\nin the phone industry you might be\nhaving smartphone normal phone like that\ndifferent categories will be there and\nthen different company\nwill also needs to be added right like\nthat\nyou need to have a product management\nmodule and then building model\nand then reports module like this\neverything will be\nyou know written in detail right that's\nabout\nuh the analysis phase once the analysis\nof\nthe entire requirements are done and one\nsoftware requirement specification\ndocument\nis generated they will once again you\nknow sit with the\ncustomer and then they will give the\ndetailing about it okay this is how\nuh you know the software requirements\nwill be filtered out these are the\nsoftware\nrequirements we can develop and these\nare the requirements\nwe will not be able to develop okay so\nthey will they will sit in detail and\nthen they will come to an\nagreement okay this is fine you can go\nahead and give me a design like how\nexactly uh you know\nthe software will look on a high level\nand then\ngive me a detailing about it and start\ndeveloping the software\nso in the design phase there are two\ntypes of design one is high level design\nand low level design you can you can see\nhere the similarities the\nsame thing you if you go back and do the\nconstruction the\nthere is a high level design which which\nwill be given uh\nby the company and then in detail about\neach and everything will also be\nyou know charted out right so similarly\nin\nsoftware also we will be having high\nlevel design\nand then low level design what is this\nhigh level design okay\ni will be having uh you know user\nmanagement module like that\nthere will be some architecture which\nwill be you know\ncharted out there will be okay this is\nthe flow\nand then like that the the high level\narchitecture will be written these are\nthe modules will be there\nand then certain modules will interact\neach other like that high level\narchitecture will be given that is high\nlevel design\nand in each and every module you might\nbe having some modules also\nright so those things will all always be\nyou know considered in low level design\nthose things will always be\nconsidered in low level design okay\nor uh detailed design we will come to\nthis will take up an example of that\nyou know inventory and building software\nand then\nwe will uh you know understand this so\nwhat overall uh you know\nwill be involved in this the develop\narchitect\narchitect from the development company\nokay\nthis this person is the main person who\nis going to you know\nwith the help of software requirement\nspecification as well as business\nrequirement specification document\nhe is going to right\ngive the high level and low level design\ndocuments so along with him\nteam leader and senior developers will\nalso be involved in this\nokay so the outcome of this particular\nphase is high level and the low level\ndesign documents\nright so we'll take up the same example\nyou can see here inventory and billing\nsoftware the high level architecture\nwould be manage inventory\nbilling user management reports like\nthis\na big module list will be given and then\nhow exactly they interact\neach other when you go to the low level\ndesign\nright so in managed inventory managed\nproducts will be there manage stocks\nwill be there manage vendors will be\nthere manage warehouses will be there\nall right so the detailing uh you know\nwill be filtered out\nuh to the core\nright that is low level design that is\nlow level design that's about design\nphase once the design\nis shown to the developer okay this is\nhow the you know entire product\nworks sometimes what happens they are\ngoing to\ndevelop this with some prototypes or\nsome\nuser interfaces you will understand\nabout all those things\nwhat is the user's interface means there\nwill not be any functionality but\nyou will be having okay a picture\npictorial kind of\nrepresentation will be given to the\nclient okay this is how it looks\nright once the client accepts that or\nif there are any changes he is going to\nyou know suggest the changes\nor if once he accepts that the\ndevelopment\nphase will start so with the help of\nrequirement\nas well as design documents developers\nokay the input for this particular\ndevelopment phase is\nrequirement as well as design documents\neverything will be considered okay not\nonly design documents\nyou need to developers will always go\nthrough requirement documents as well as\ndesign documents\nand then they are going to start writing\nthe code to develop the product\nhow they are going to write the code\nwith the help of certain coding\nlanguages or programming languages like\nc\nor c plus plus right or java\nor python like this many programming\nlanguages are there\nwith the help of all these programming\nlanguages\nthey are going to develop a software if\nit might be one programming language or\nit might be combination of many\nprogramming languages\nright for a big enterprise application\nit will always be a combination of\nmultiple programming languages will be\nthere\nso all level of developers will be\ninvolved in this in the sense\n[Music]\nthe senior developers junior developers\nand then\nteam leaders sometimes team leaders may\nalso you know code\nright all those behind in the\ndevelopment phase the project managers\nalso in\nmaybe you know daily meeting or weekly\nmeetings they will be involved\nso it is a it is a very very big phase\nof software development all those phases\nare\nyou know one or one\nwindow and then this software\ndevelopment is a very very big phase\nbecause whatever\nyou have decided you need to bring it uh\nyou know\nas a software bring the software as an\noutput so\na lot of lot of time will be you know\ninvolved\ntime and resources will be involved in\nthis so the outcome of this particular\nphase is source code as well as\ndeveloped product\nokay so source code with source code in\nthe sense with the\nprogramming languages whatever code you\nare going to write that will be called\nas\nsource code and then the final developed\nproduct\nonce this particular phase is completed\nright\nthe there will be a testing phase the\ndeveloped product is tested thoroughly\nby the testing team\nand ensure that the software is error\nfree\nso like software development life cycle\nwe also have software testing life cycle\nwe will understand like what all the\ndifferent phases which are involved in\nsoftware testing life cycle\neven that is a you know testing is a\npart of software development life cycle\nand in its own it has its own you know\nsystematic approach and different\nmethodologies will be there on different\ntypes of testing will be there\nall those things should be considered\nwhile testing a software\nso with the help of software testing\nlife cycle\nthe testing team is going to test the\ndeveloped software so what are all\noverall roles which\nwhich are involved all levels of\ntestosterone junior senior testers\nteam leads project managers or you know\ntest managers\nall those persons will be involved in\nthis with an outcome\nquality product and test artifacts so\ntest artifacts means lot of\ndocumentation\ndocuments will be you know generated in\nthis particular software\ntesting life cycle in this test strategy\nwill be there\ntest plan document will be there and uh\nyou know to test the product\nthey will be having a systematic a\nstep-by-step test\ncase will be there right so and then\nthe what if you find some errors or bugs\nthat bug reports will be there all those\nare called test artifacts lot of\ndocuments will be the\noutput of this particular phase once the\ntesting is complete\nright and test one's test management\nteam\ngives a go ahead for the product to you\nknow\nrelease to the customer that particular\nproduct will be you know deployed or\nwill be\ninstalled in the customer environment in\nthe development\nphase development there will be a\ndevelopment environment\nin the testing phase there will be a\ntesting environment\nand the customer environment will be the\nproduction environment\nthis will be the production environment\nokay so that is called deployment phase\nonce everything is done after testing\nteam\nsign off the product is deployed or\ninstalled in the customer environment\nfor the end user\nso who are all involved in this\nparticular deployment phase\ndeployment engineers there will be\nseparate deployment engineers will be\nthere\nthey are going to deploy the product in\nthe customer's environment\nso what is the outcome of this phase\nready to use product in production\nenvironment\nready to use product in customer or\nproduction\nenvironment the customer environment\nwhere we have deployed the software is\ncalled\nproduction environment so the last phase\nis\nmaintenance phase right even in\nproduction environment we might start\ngetting some errors or issues\nand those needs to be addressed and\nresolved it is not that you know\nafter doing so much of testing and\ndevelopment and everything the\nend product will be you know 100 error\nfree\nthat that will not never be the case uh\nyou know for\nin any software development so whatever\nerrors you find in the production\nenvironment\nthose errors needs to be you know\nresolved\nor there will be you know some new\nchange or enhancement request so\ninitially the customer for this\ninventory and billing software he might\nhave told ok\ni have only one branch but multiple\nuh you know users will be there now\nafter six months he will say hey i am\nstarting one more branch\nthe entire you know for that branch the\nentire\ninventory and then billing and\neverything should be different\nbut the software whatever you are going\nto\nyou know give me should be an integrated\none\nin the sense everything should be in one\nplace i i\ni should be able to see everything uh in\nmy hand in a sense all the reports and\neverything of that branch also so for\nthat what you need to do\nthis is a new new change request or new\nit's\nit's also called as enhancement request\nso you need to add one more module\ncalled branch model\nwhere you need to create one branch\nright there is a main branch and then\nbranch two and then in that for that\nbranch you need to start adding the\nusers and then the stock and all those\nthings\nso these kind of requirements might also\ncome in the\nmaintenance phase so how exactly this\nmaintenance will be done\nthere will be a service level agreements\nbetween customer you know customer\nas well as the development company and\nthen based on those agreements they are\ngoing to\nresolve the issues and then if there are\nany new changes\nright they will they will agree that\nokay\ni will give you maintenance for two\nyears for this amount\nanything i ask you should be able to do\nit or\nthe agreements can be any type\nright so in this particular maintenance\nphase production support engineers\ndevelopers and testers all these three\npeople will be involved\nif there are any new changes or requests\nthose changes needs to be you know first\ndiscussed with the production support\nengineers and then it will be passed to\nthe developers developers will develop\nthose things and then\nit will be tested and then again it will\nbe deployed\nright if there are any errors or issues\nsometimes production support engineers\ncan also you know fix those\nissues or errors or if the customers\nhave any queries related to any module\nor anything\nwill also be you know addressed by these\nproduction support engineers\nso this is the you know maintenance\nphase in the sense after\ncompleting the development you need to\nyou know maintain the software for\nyou know n number of years for\nn number of years because it is not that\none year they will use\nyou know stop it they might uh you know\nuse it for many years with\nmany you know new requirements or many\nusers\nor any any requirement come for that\nmatter right\nso it is also you know very very\nimportant phase in\nsoftware development life cycle\nthat's about the entire you know the\nphases whatever we have discussed here\nall these different phases right and\ntheir detailed\nuh overview what what happens in each\nand every phase and then who are all\nwill be involved\nin each and every phase of that\nparticular software development life\ncycle\nso in this particular software\ndevelopment life cycle we have different\nmodels\nokay so models are nothing but different\napproaches right for a small software\nwhat needs to be the approach for a big\nsoftware what needs to be the approach\nor for an\nenterprise software what needs to be the\napproach right\nso there are different different you\nknow approaches or models are there\nwhich are now very standard and commonly\nused in the industry\nthe first one is waterfall model\niterative model prototype model\nrapid application development spiral\nmodel v\nmodel and agile methodology so these are\nall\nyou know very very important models\nwhich we have\nused and then this is a traditional\nmodel but agile methodology is the you\nknow\nmodel which is used currently in the\nmarket\nso we will see all the important you\nknow\nsdlc models in our upcoming videos\nso that's about a software development\nlifecycle\nso if you like this video i think i i\nhave taken\nyou know with lot of examples i have\nexplained the software development life\ncycle because\nthis is the fundamental for any\ndeveloper or\nany tester who wants to come to software\nindustry\nright you need to know in detail about\nit that's why i have taken uh you know\nthis particular\nvideo a bit long with lot of examples\nand a lot of explanation\nif you like this video please you know\nsubscribe to our channel as well as we\nare present in all these different\nuh platforms like we have a youtube\nchannel we have a\nfacebook page we have our own website\nand then we have facebook group\nyou can you know follow us on all these\nplatforms in each and every platform we\nwill come up with\nuh you know new stuff stuff about\nthe software the technology and then if\nthere are any you know job openings\nwhich needs to be referred that also be\nyou know taken\nposted in our facebook pages as well as\nfacebook group\nso please do follow us in all these\nplatforms\nthank you so much for watching\n",
