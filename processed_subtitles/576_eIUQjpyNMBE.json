  "text": "[Music]\nI'm Orchard Orchard misra I'm a\nprofessor and the school of information\nsystems at SMU and I also currently\nserve as our associate E in a research\nand I direct a center on smart nation\nanalytics so I think the big idea is\nthat Tina for the last 20 30 years we've\ntaught of computation is something we do\nfirst with desktop machines and then\nmore with our mobile phones and maybe\nour smart watches but computation and\nsensing is now moving to what's called a\npervasive world where it's all around us\nso you know the table that on which we\nwork will have computing embedded in it\nyou know the coffee maker of the fridge\nis going to have computing in it so this\nrequires new ways of sensing and new\nways of humans to interact with these\ndevices and that is what excites me most\nabout my research we recognize going\nforward that one of the big challenge as\nsensors proliferate around us is that we\njust won't be able to recharge them\ncontinuously you know nobody likes to\ntake you know a wearable device off\ntheir hand and then recharge it twice a\nday so a lot of my new work is looking\nat the possibility of building ultra low\nenergy wearable devices or battery less\nwearable devices so one of the projects\nthat I'm really fascinated by right now\nis this ability to build a wearable\ndevice that really has no battery and\nthe way it's charged its charged by the\ntransmissions from a regular Wi-Fi\naccess point now the big innovation in\nthat is that most access point\ntransmissions because they're\nomnidirectional they spread all around\nyou the amount of energy you can harvest\nis no more than one to two micro watts\nthat's too minuscule for anything\nrealistic however if you're able to\ndirect the beam using some electronic\nbeamforming technologies you're able to\nharvest almost hundred times more power\nso what we've demonstrated recently is\nthe ability to build a wearable device\nthat's on your wrist that has no battery\nthat is charged by this beamforming\ntechnology\nfrom conventional Wi-Fi access points\nbut that you can run and it can capture\nall the various hand movements you do in\nyour office during the day so whether\nyou're typing whether you're having a\ndrink water you know whether you're sort\nof pointing at things on a whiteboard\nyou're able to capture all of these\nenergy and human behavior without ever\nneeding to replace the battery so one of\nthe other projects that's actually going\non and I'm very pleased that it's also\nbeing implemented in our SMU gym and so\nin the gym what we've taken is you know\nyou have these weight stacks we put a\nvery simple sensor it's a magnetic meter\nwhich is magnetic sensor and\naccelerometer which measures the\nvertical up-and-down movement and by\nusing the data from the simple sensor\nwe're able to figure out with pretty\nhigh over 95% accuracy the amount of\nweight you lift the exercise you do\nwhether you're doing a bicep curl or you\nknow shoulder push press or so on and\nalso most interesting ly the user of the\nindividual who's actually doing the\nworkout because it turns out each of us\nhave a unique way of performing this\nworkout now the reason this excites me\nis this opens up the possibility that\nwith just instrumenting a few devices\nand you not having to wear anything to\nthe gym we can begin to digitally track\nsort of qualify the workout that you're\ngoing through and after that one can\nstart to personalize the recommendations\nso you can think of this as an\nelectronic digital coach for you telling\nyou that you maybe you're working out\ntoo fast or you're lifting too much\nweight it can give you more accurate\ntarget feedback so it reduces a risk of\ninjury maximizes the effectiveness of\nyour workout and in general by engaging\nwith you admits in real life\nthat you will continue to work out so I\nthink that of healthy living and\ndistraction free living are two benefits\nof Altis pervasive technology for\nindividual consumers\nyou\n",
