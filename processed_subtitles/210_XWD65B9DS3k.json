  "text": "te currently in medical field without\nprior Tech experience okay that's fine\nno problem at all that's why we're here\nto take you from zero to Cloud right it\ndoesn't matter your background we are\nhere to you know take you from zero to\nthe cloud so you have nothing to worry\nabout basically so like I was saying um\nafter the introduction we'll be bringing\none of our Cloud professionals on board\nwho's going to be talking to us about\nyou know the Cloud job rules basically\ndemystifying what the cloud role is all\nabout basically right and how you can\nposition yourself to be at The Cutting\nEdge of what this opportunities what you\nstand to get from this opportunities\nright so um that's basically what we're\ngoing to be doing for the first part of\nthe session and for the second part\nwe're going to be getting into the um\nwhat's it called now into the um permit\nme to to just check in yeah panel\ndiscussion thank you panel discussion so\nwe're going to be going into the panel\ndiscussion where we'll have them also\ncome on board and share with us um some\nof the things that we need to equip\noursel with if we're going to be\ntransitioning into Tech it's very very\nimportant so that you don't you don't\njust go into it and then you find\nyourself struggling and then you say\nthat oh at the end of the day you decide\nto you know give up so we they are here\nto answer all your questions basically\nand on that note um it's very important\nfor you to note that um if you have any\nquestion whatsoever kindly drop it um\nwe're going to be dropping a link in the\nchat box so please kindly use the sedo\nlink to drop all your questions there\nwill be no question we will not be\ntaking any question from the chat box so\nplease and please a link will be dropped\nfor us in the chat box all right so it's\ncalled a SLO link so once the link has\nbeen dropped kindly just put in your\nquestion there and we will be able to\ntake all your questions right we're\nready we are in for it tonight so you\nhave nothing to worry about but please\nand please we just like you to take\nnotes of this the SLO link will be\ndropped in the chat box very shortly so\nwe would like you to use that link to\nyou know put in your question whatever\nquestion you have about transitioning\ninto Tech about Cloud about about devops\nwe are yet to answer those questions\nright it's very very um important that\nyou take note of this okay so I'm going\nto be getting back to the um chat\nsession again\nso okay so Victor says um it's from a\nboying it's not sure okay I'm not sure\ncloud is for me or anything related to\nTech but I hope it will be for me at the\nend of today definitely we're hoping\nwe're hoping as well um Al from Saudi\nArabia says is an operation SL\nperformance analyst I want to transition\ninto the main Tech cloud is where my\nfocus lies I have some key questions to\nask though okay great thank you Al for\nsharing so please once we have the um\nSLO link being dropped in the chat box\nkindly use it to answer to drop in your\nquestions basically and you will be able\nto take it all right thank you so much\num everyone I think that will be all for\nnow before I get to introduce our first\nspeaker for tonight our first speaker\nfor tonight so I'm going to be going\nover is bio so that we can know that so\nthat you all can know that the person\nwe're bringing on board they are not\npeople who are just going to be telling\nyou something vague they've been into it\nthey've been into it and they know\neverything that you need to be able to\nbe able to transition into Tech\nbasically so um I'm going to go ahead\nand read a bio right now says um Charles\nis a fixer and reformer at Arts is\npassionate about problem solving and the\ntechnology industry he's a senior Cloud\nengineer at Amazon web services that AWS\nstationed at their Cape Town office\nbefore Amazon Childs worked with an\nindigenous exploration and production\nfirm in Nigeria and was in charge of the\nit infrastructure and IT service\nmanagement so you you you know what\nyou're getting into tonight Charles has\na bachelor's in electrical and\nelectronic engineering from the\nUniversity of ion and was appointed as a\nGoogle student ambassador to UI by\nGoogle while on campus the skill set\ninclude Enterprise Cloud architect\ninfrastructure as code automation\nsystems Administration networking and\nscripting he is an Avid Reader and\nlifelong learner whenever you don't\nfound child um behind the computer\nscreen is probably draw me with his\nfingers at the piano so ladies and\ngentlemen this evening I would just like\nyou to welcome Charles as as it takes\nover the session tonight um Charles good\nevening good to have you on the call\nthank you for joining us it's always a\npleasure to have\nyou um hello everyone thank you for\nhaving me Charles here let me see if my\nlight's going better okay I think it's\ngood now hello thank you for having me\nit's my pleasure to be here this evening\nfor the next couple minutes we'll be\nlooking at different Cloud rules and\nhopefully you get an idea of where you\nfit in which of the options that you can\ntry out and hopefully build career in\nnow we\nare we are taking this webinar on a very\nvery basic level so we don't assume that\nyou have any prior it knowledge prior it\nknowledge we expect you might be coming\nfrom different\ndisciplines within Cloud P Academy we've\nactually been able to convert those that\ncame from Linguistics English like\ndifferent history different fields and\nare now working as Cloud Professionals\nin Industry so if you join the academy\nyou get to hear from them from time to\ntime how they were able to move from\nEnglish or from the the literary world\nto it world and our and our flourishing\nin that industry so I'm just want to I\nwant to get my screen shared now yes so\nlet's kick it off so we'll be looking at\ncloud different Cloud roles different\noptions of as a cloud professional or\ndevops engineer whatever those terms\nmean and over the next couple slides\nuh by the end of this session you\nunderstand the key requirements for\nlanding atry level cloud jobs you also\ndiscover different Cloud roles that\nmatch your transferable skills and\ninterest and you can have more clarity\non your transition Journey\nright so who is a cloud professional a\ncloud professional is someone who works\nwith Cloud well systems and tools\napparently and when we say cloud\ncompared to traditional it systems where\nyou need to configure manually or\nphysically you get some cabling maybe\nyou go to Data Center very cooling\nyou're doing all this remotely\neverything is secured in the cloud\nsomewhere maybe running on some data\ncenter somewhere in the world you could\nbe in Europe and the data center the\nserver that you're working on is over in\nthe US or you could be in Europe the\nservers that you're working on are in\nSydney or in Australia so a cloud\nprofessional is someone who works with\ndifferent online tool systems and tools\ndifferent cloud services or even hybrid\ncloud system that is working with Amazon\nGoogle Cloud Azure cloud and being able\nto configure that together to be able to\nrun an application the systems and tools\nstore manage and process data over the\nInternet so you're not physically going\nto Data Center to to go and go and\nconfigure servers or troubleshoots\neverything is done remotely instead of\nusing fiscal servers and you they help\nbusinesses run their applications and\nprocesses information in a way that is\nflexible\nsecure and easy to access from anywhere\nso let me let me blow your mind before\ntraditionally when before the era of the\ncloud right um every company will have\nits own data center this this room that\nis heavily guarded in your organization\nyou must have seen some some rooms like\nthat many companies have now moved\nonline but we still have some companies\nthat still have data centers traditional\ndata centers they'll be very cooling\nthere'll be lot of cooling systems HED\nspecialized hbac systems love server\nrcks if you peep into it be like one\nheavily GED like a bunker an underground\nbunker or maybe like where to put the\ngold coins and American Federal Reserve\nBank yeah that's how the rooms look so\nyou would typically order serers maybe\nfrom HP Dell or IBM then back then and\nthis order usually takes five five\nmonths sometimes six months or eight\nmonths sometime I've also been on the\nother end before now I've had to order\nsome h servers in my previous role and\nthis took a while four six months before\nit arrived right and even after it\narrived you have to configure it\nsometimes when you ordered it\napplication requirements would have\nchanged from the application team so it\nwasn't flexible that's a point there was\na lot of delays to release application\nbut now with Cloud you can launch a\nserver at just a snap of finger click of\na button all those things we needed to\nwait time there's no time you take to\njust need to click on the type of server\nyou want windows or Linux or to Mac and\nboom you get it if it doesn't meet your\nyour if after you started working on it\nand doesn't meet your specification you\ncan easily just destroy it and launch\nterminate it and launch a new one so the\ncloud makes this um application\ndeployment server configuration much\nfaster I mean I dare say a 100 a th%\nfaster because remember looking at you\nused to take six months before and now\nyou could do it within hours or within\nseconds within minutes so that's that's\nphenomenal\nso Cloud just makes um running\napplications working with servers\neverything flexible and easy you pay as\nyou go instead of Maybe by ordering a\nserver for $25,000 or $10,000 in the\npast you can just walk start running a\nserver you be paying per per minute and\nyou halfway through the Journey or one\nhour through you discover that this\nserver is not meeting a specification\nmaybe doesn't have enough RAM or it's\nnot meeting your CPU requirements you\ncan you can upgrade it instead of\nterminating you can just say okay\nplease help me AWS or Google or Azure\nhelp me upgrade this this my my my my\ncloud instance to a higher version where\nI can have more CPU and in a twinken\nover just part off CH make that change\nand there you go so let's move on so\nwhat are different types of cloud\nprofessionals they are The Architects\nthose that will Design how the service\nwill integrate to each other right so\nthose those Architects do work first\nbefore the operation guys the cloud\nprofessionals now start doing it so\ntakes a while to move from operations to\narchitecture but um just know that\nbefore you start any Cloud work Cloud\nwork Cloud project most times there will\nbe an architect that will have gone\nthrough and try to synthesize and try to\nlook at what the application customer\nrequirements and try to architect how\nthe a couple of services together they\ncan use to achieve the objective right\nso um then on the operational side now\nwe now have Engineers that will be\ninvolved in three broad categories some\nthat will be in administration some that\nwill be in operations some that will be\nhandling security Securities Peri is\nzero so I'll start with security so\nremember no customer want to move it\ndata to the cloud or it service to the\ncloud if it's not secure right so\nsecurity is priority zero and you should\ntreat treat that way so those of you\nthat might be confused why I'm using\nzero so in computer lingo right I'm not\nsure I know in mathematics in arithm you\nstart from one two three but in\ncomputers computers actually start at\nzero when they're counting so that's why\nI say priority zero so when you hear me\nsaying security is priority zero it just\nsimply means that is number one it's the\nfirst thing you get out of the way so\nthe cloud professionals that can be\nworking on security ensuring that\nthere's list privilege access\nconfidentiality Integrity authentication\nis in place multiactor\nauthentication and also maybe may be\nusing identity provider like OCTA um to\nintegrate authenticate so that users\ndon't have multiple password so security\ndon't worry we'll talk about that then\nthe the operational guys the okay I want\nto launch a new server I want to upgrade\na server I want to deploy this\napplication um I've written the code\nhelp me deploy it so those are the\noperations here they work closely with\nthe It software development team to\ndeploy then we have the administration\nguys right those people administer they\nthey monitor they manage the environment\nsecurity patching things like patching\napplying security patches Microsoft\nreleases it Amazon also releases some\npatches monthly for Linux Dr Amazon\nLinux dros those ones are rolling\nupdates that you need to ensure they\nthey to be able to meet some compliance\nrequirement especially if you're a\ncompany like cap one or a bank or they\nusing processing money people's money or\nPro Pi data mind you back to security\nthere are penalties for leaks for pii\nwhen pi is misused or mis handled in\nEurope we have gdpr those of you that\nare passionate about security can go and\nread up about gdpr gdpr is like the\nregulating um um is the body that\nregulates how information is processed\nand stored in any um in Europe on any\nCloud Server even Europeans um\ninformation it might not even be in\nEurope Sydney but if as long as European\ndata that you having there you have to\nabide by the gdpr laws and the penalties\nare heavy if you mishandle or if they\nare leaks if your data leaks so you need\nto be very careful there so\nAdministration setting up the system so\nI just went from from right to left so\nlet's move on now so let's look at the\njob market now Amazon CE CEO that's Andy\nJazzy usually say something that less\nthan 5% or about 5% of Enterprise it\nworkloads have been moved to the cloud\nso this means that there's still a huge\nchunk of um it spending that is not yet\nin the cloud huge chunk of IT services\nthat have not been moved to the cloud so\njust um just note that we are still in\nthe early days of the cloud cloud is not\nsaturated yet so everyone has a place um\nfor the next few years many companies\nwill still be migrating to the cloud and\nCloud now be become a def facto so this\nis why a lot of operations Engineers are\nneeded around the world now devops\nprofessional Cloud professionals to be\nable to bridge that gap between\ncompanies that migrating and compan that\njust want to run the application already\nin the cloud so we have some data\nstatistics here from um um some notable\ncompanies that says that between 20 2022\nand 2023 public cloud services grew by\n22.9% year overy year with Revenue\nreaching over 500 billion in 2022 that's\ntell you the amount of the market sh is\na very very big market and according to\nmckin the cloud Market is expected to\nreach an estimated three trillion in\nRevenue by 2030 so if you're able to\ncomplete the the tradings and get\ncertifications out of the way you can\nget the basics some skills mean 5 years\nfrom now wo you have access to unlock\nsome significant value in the industry\nso see this as an opportunity there's\nopportunity in the market that's the\nthat's the that's the that's the\ninformation that I want you to get from\nthis data so the surge of AI across\nIndustries a sharply increased the\ndemand for cloud professionals as I said\nearlier who manage secure and optimize\nCloud environment to support these\nTechnologies so let dive into them now\nabout I have about 11 or 12 of them now\nremember not every all companies will\nhave Cloud to Engineers Cloud develops\nEngineers some might just have one Cloud\nengineer doing all those things some\nmight if it's a big company like Netflix\nor\nUber then you may have different but we\nwe in this slides we've just tried to\nintroduce that these are the different\ntypes of cloud jobs that we have out\nthere it doesn't mean that you shouldn't\ntry to combine it or if you are hired as\na devops engineer you're not starting to\ndo many of those things you not be\nwondering oh but I only came in as a\ndevops luk depending on the small\ncompanies and this Advantage for small\ncomp small companies small team doing a\nlot of things work but big companies\ndifferent teams different Engineers\ndoing specific things so see it there an\nopportunity even if you have to do many\nof those things in one maybe you're not\njust doing one of those roles that we're\ngoing to discuss today it's an\nopportunity to learn as you grow your\ncareer those these skills will be very\nvery helpful\nso we're going to be just speaking on\nBroad terms now Cloud support engineer a\ncsse like myself we help customers\nresolve simple to complex issues with\ncloud services by applying Advanced well\nbasic to advanc troubleshooting\ntechniques and deep technical expertise\nthe beauty of cloud support engineer is\nthat you can enter fresh that this entry\nlevel you can come as a CSA straight\nfrom school right without any experience\nso you go through associate get training\nand before you graduate with CSC CSC and\nyou begin to grow senior CSC and you\neven might Branch out to become a\nsolution architect or Enterprise\narchitect so CS is like the ENT you can\nenter as entry level just know that CSC\nis in gr you can build some CSS that\nentry level some Advanced some very very\nsenior some are 10 15 years um CSS right\num so they act as a bridge between users\nor customers and cloud service providers\nensuring a simless experience for\ncustomers and you can work in different\nIndustries you can you can work in techn\nindustry Finance e-commerce\ntelecommunications and we have companies\nthat that you can find these rules awss\nMicrosoft Google Cloud Oracle Google\nCloud C it's customer engineer it's the\nsame thing as a cloud support engineer\nOracle JY Bank MTN plotter wave and Jr\nwell this is not an exhaustive list as I\nsaid but this gives you an idea of of of\nof what they do let's move on um so to\nbe a CSC you need to have basic to\nadvance understanding of Cloud platforms\nat least you know to know one Cloud\nplatform how integrate together how it\nworks together problem solving skills\ncommunication skills and in the then\ntypical day in life customers will come\nto you or your users come to you oh my\napplication is crashed my application is\nfailing my server crashed oh I want to\ncouple I want Design This generative AI\nsolution how can I integrate it oh I'm\ntrying to integrate this Lambda function\nwith this step function and it's failing\nhow can I integrate it to that can you\nhelp me diagnose this error can you help\nme develop a script to be able to\nautomate this this and that so I'm going\nvery technical now but those are kind of\nqueries that you be you be working with\nas a CSC so any potential is quite large\nyou could be earning from well you can\nsee some figures there but these are not\n100% full this gives you an idea of of\nof the amount you earn right um career\ntrajectory Cloud support specialist that\nis you can move from a CS to become a\ncloud support specialist to become an\noperations engineer to become a\nSolutions aror let's move on so Cloud\narchitect yes Cloud architect is a\njunior well Junior Cloud architect here\nthat helps design Cloud systems that\nmeet a company's needs so you Des you\ndecide which cloud services to use for a\nspecific use case right a specific\nproject or a job maybe you want to\ndesign a ticketing application or you\nwant to design a generative application\nand okay I want to use sageer Bedrock or\nE2 where should I run how should I run\nthese models which of the models should\nI use you you need you'll be applying a\nlot of trade-offs here you'll be doing a\nlot of tradeoffs and application\nintegration how the application how the\ndifferent cloud services integrate to\neach other there are lot of Industries\nwhere you can work Healthcare Finance\nretail technology and companies that\nusually have Cloud acted include Amazon\nyeah IBM Google Cloud Microsoft Cisco\nand the likes so let's look at the\nskills that you need to have to become a\ncloud architect so you need to have deep\nunderstanding of cloud platforms basics\nof cloud design and chitecture knowledge\nof key cloud services computer storage\nnetworking serverless and typically a\nday in the life you be designing\ncloud-based Solutions customers will\ncome to you oh I want to design a\npayment solution I want to design or an\nidentity provider solution what kind of\nservic should I use couple together the\ndevelopers are visting the code how\nshould they deploy it which kind of\nservice what tradeoff should they make\nhow can they optimize the cost so that\nthey still able to divide from value and\nsome they're able to break even over\ntime running on the cloud um working\nwith clients understand the needs\nensuring smooth integration of cloud\nservices to to run the application that\nyour customer is running you can see the\nany potential potential rather is also\nquite High um career trajectory you\ncould go from a cloud Junior Cloud\narchitect to a senior Cloud architect to\nEnterprise architect to even to become\nthe\nCTO right so let's move on who's the\ncloud devops engineer a cloud devops\nengineer makes sure software runs\nefficiently in the cloud by automating\nprocesses ensuring that the the release\nthe new versions are new updates are\nreleased very well and even if you make\na release and it's bad many customers\nare complaining like GT bank or many of\nthis you find that is bugging production\nyou quickly roll it back quickly to the\nprevious version so you manage release\nprocess deployment integration of code\ndifferent versioning of the code that\ndevelopers have written so you also do a\nlot of automation infrastructure as code\nin this role so you you work closely\nwith the development and it teams to be\nable to manage software release and\npackage management so you use a lot of\ncontainerization here doing a lot of\nDocker images and how to to manage those\nimages ensuring those images are meeting\nyour standard your application\nrequirements so places you can work\ninclude Industries like technology\nFinance e-commerce in fact this rule is\nthe most popular develops engineer role\nand almost every industry now that is\nmoving to the cloud or using the cloud\nin some way um requires you devops\nEngineers so companies include AWS Azure\nGoogle cloud and the likes Netflix and\nthe\nlikes so what are the skills that you\nneed to have to become a rockstar devops\nengineer you need to have basic\nknowledge of cloud platforms and basic\nscripting understanding of C cicd\npipelines if you don't know what cicd is\ndon't worry it comes to the academy\nyou'll know what CD is if you go through\nour our Academy and um you have\ninfrastructure to menion popular\ninfrastructure as code tools like\nterraform anible cdk Cloud development\nkits for Amazon and P\nformation yeah what's a day in the\ntypical life of a devops engineer you\nautomate Cloud infrastructure setups for\nexample you have this application\ncurrently running in London and you want\nto replicate the same thing in Sydney\ninstead of having to provision\neverything everything's already as code\nyou just spin it up using a cloud\nformation template or terraform template\nor anible or city can in a different\nregion and everything's up and running\njust like a snap of a button um so the\ncareer trajectory you could go from\nJunior devops engineer to a senior\ndevops engineer to devops manager and\nCloud Solutions Architects and the ening\npotential is also quite High trust me\nand a lot of people in what are looking\nfor devops engineers like we can you can\nexhaust them you can exhaust the rules\nthat available for devops engineers Sr\nis I love this one this one has a very\nvery Sr the term Sr was invented by\nGoogle and Google actually did a lot of\nping work in the era of cloud computing\nand containerization with kubernetes so\nthose of you that don't know kubernetes\nan orchestration Eng engine for Docker\nsorry for containers and largely\ndeveloped by Google many many years ago\n14 15 years ago now um s ensures Cloud\nsystems are highly available reliable\nand they do a lot of automation they\nautomate a lot of operational tasks you\nwant to shut down this you want to\nhandle patch manone everything is\nautomated so Sr tries the goal of Sr is\nto make sure you're automating most of\nthe operational tax ensuring the systems\nare running reliably and highly\navailable the monitor performance yes\nyou ment a lot of advanced monitorings\navailability into application and\ninfrastructure design scaling system so\nexam customers come to you they're\ncurrently running with 1,000 users they\nwant to go to 100,000 users they want to\nensure the system is able to handle that\ntraffic so you need to now look so the\nSR Engineers would design the scaling\npart element of that\napplication so place you can work a lot\ne-commerce banking Healthcare technology\nand Company they use that use Sr are\nvery all over almost every company I\nknow top Fortune 500 company I know uses\nan S Sr One Way Sr doesn't only work\nwith a cloud this customer might your\ncustomer might have the data on premises\nbut Sr is Sr anywhere either in the\ncloud or in premises the same um um um\nsame role job scope so you need to have\ndeep understanding of cloud\ninfrastructure right um when turn you\nneed to very good with monitoring tools\nlike promethus\ngrafana knowledge of scripting language\nand you need to be confortable writing\ncode in at least one language if it's\npython you know you can develop python\napplications web applications use\npopular Frameworks this is Java you need\nto know spring or at least one web\nframework to able to develop at least um\nsome GUI and applications to monitor to\ntrack\nlatencies reduce um um to manage your\napplications or infrastructures code\nso a typical day in the life of an Sr\nyou're automating a away you're finding\noperational tax to automate a way so\nyou're monitoring system performance and\ngetting proper\nalerting and ensuring automatic recovery\nfrom failures for example when you\nconnect to your laptop to the internet\nthe first thing most most of us is to go\nto google.com to Ure that there's\ninternet right U so Google has developed\nthat that reputation that they always\navailable so it's the SR teams that have\nthat made that possible that they\nregardless if they have maintenance or\nanything Google is you always know that\nat least when you go to google.com or go\nto Cod UK you should get a respon so\nthat's phenomenal hat off to the Google\nSr teams so ensuring systems are\nreliable and skillable so the en\npotential is quite High about the\nhighest one of the highest let me say\nthe highest and career trajectory you\ncould go from the senior SR to lead Sr\nto engineering director or even the\nCTO let's move on cloud this ad me yeah\nthese are people that do a lot of os\nmanagement um urance is available if it\ncrashes how to recover from\ncrashes um provisioning monitoring and\npatching right lot of companies that you\ncan work for and the industries almost\nevery industry requires a a systems\nadministrator in one way or the other\nbut let's go to the skills that you need\nto have you need to have Cloud\nmanagement skills maybe AWS asual Google\nneed to know networking at least medium\nto Advanced networking knowledge Linux\nor W and windows medium to advance so\nthe cloud systems Administration is very\nvery similar to the power engineer role\nwell most of the information here you\nneed to also have it in CSC role so as a\ncloud admin to me same thing as a cloud\nsupport engineering because you need to\nknow Linux Windows Administration your\nnetwork has solid and you also need to\nknow infrastructure as code tools and\ndevops typically devops tools so you can\ntroubleshoot something to or to um\nfigure out what's wrong you need to know\nhave deep understanding of system so s\nmeans do a lot of os\nwork so what's the day in the life of a\ns mean you manage Cloud resources ensure\nthe system is up if it's Crash you need\nto figure out why is it crashing is a\ndriver ensures that the drivers are\nreleased safely try to make sure it\ndoesn't happen again um handling backups\nand security configuration things like\nthat um career trajectory means you\ncould go from a senior assist admin to\nfrom a junior admin to a senior admin to\na cloud operations manager to Cloud\narchitect all the way up the the chain\nand you can see the ending potential is\nalso very high six Cloud security\nanalyst I know a lot of people on the on\nthe C security enthus so cyber security\nyeah this one is for you so this this\nother rule also has other varations you\ncould hear setups de setups everything\nis just Security operation security\nanalyst a security analyst could be a\nsetups SEC Ops starts for security\noperations engine so setups for short or\nDev setups development security\noperations so when you hear setups Dev\nseup as I see I put on on the slide here\njust know that he also referring to the\nsecurity analyst role see security\nanalyst protects the cloud from hackers\nsecurity threats and ensures that users\nare implementing are working\nauthenticating the right people have the\nright access the right people have the\nright access and authentic what does\nthat mean it means that's thats the\nprinciple of least privilege so it's\nonly users that need to do something\nthat should have that you shouldn't have\nall the permission don't give him\nadministrator access because you just\nwant see simp you should only have\nspecific per permissions to be able to\ndo specific um job that you need him to\ndeliver so security analyst setups Dev\nsetups Engineers the monitor for any\nsecurity issues implements principle of\nlist privilege and security\nconfigurations develop and assign\npermissions a lot of policies you do a\nlot of polic policies development policy\naudits ensuring that only users have\nzero trust implementing principle of\nzero trust security configuration so a\nlot of security work is done by the\nsecurity\nanalyst place you can work every\nindustry because everyone wants to be\nsecured Healthcare especially because\nwhen you're dealing with people's data\nprivate data you need to be very secured\nright unless you run risk of penalties\ngdpr and nist for America finance\ngovernment technology companies include\nalmost every company because um security\nsecurity is in priority zero right\nthat's what I called it in my intro so\nyou need to have security tools you need\nknowledge of security tools like\nfirewalls VPN cryptography SSL\ncertificate management encryption chist\nencryption asymmetric encryption\nsymmetric encryption wor security\nanalysts Enthusiast will know what\nunderstand what I'm saying but if you're\nif you're keen on security in the cloud\nthen uh you need to look at what these\nterms and understand what they do maybe\ntake some security trainings as\nwell um you need to understand Cloud\nplatform security how to implement\npolice privileg um access on the cloud\nmonitoring for threats and\nvulnerabilities and a typical day in the\nlife of a of a security analyst you\nmonitor Cloud environment for threats\nmaybe using automated Solutions maybe\nnext Generation firewall maybe 40 gate\nor Palo Auto or you just been doing some\nsecurity monitoring you want to be\ninsect expecting your packets ensuring\nthat the right packets are going through\nyour systems implementing security\nmeasures to defend guard Duty dos\nprotection um um SQL injection\nprotection for applications things like\nthat you also investigate and respond to\nincidents you develop and assign\npermissions you developing policies a\nlot You' doing a lot of policy\ndevelopment will know this very well\nbecause she was also um she's been a\ncups engineer in the in the previous\nrole um and from the career trajectory\nyou could move from a security engineer\nto Cloud security lead to cyber security\nmanager to CTO security trust me is\npaying is one of the hot hottest paying\njobs you you guys can understand it in\nfact security maybe pays higher so those\nof you are passionate about money right\nbut everyone wants to live a comfortable\nlife be able to take care of family so\nif you really Ken on money right trust\nme security pays a lot because security\nis priority Z so if you can take time to\nlearn all these things trust me you\ncould be you could be smiling to the\nbank people just wonder why he's smiling\noh yeah he's smiling he's always smiling\nyeah he's a security engineer okay now\nsay let's move\non cloud data engineer so we're in the\nera of data data generative AI if if you\ndon't know the generative AI is was\ntrained by terabytes of data like data\nthat can't sit on your laptop or sit on\nany server that you can imagine it has\nto you have to put it on on a collection\nof servers as high performance servers\nin a cluster before you can see that\ndata so um data those data professionals\nare now in demand because data\nengineering is very relevant in\nthe\nsorry very relevant in the AI era which\nwe are now generative AI\nera so the cloud data engineer manages\ndata in the cloud the make sure data is\nstored safely processed efficiently and\nsecurely\nand available for\nanalysis and you can work in Industries\nlike media e-commerce banking\ntechnology um place like Netflix Open AI\nany anybody that is doing AI will need\nsome data engineer in switch payack\nAmazon these are all companies that\nrequire data\nEngineers what are the skills that you\nneed to have understanding of cloud data\nservices wss3 red shift Ado basics of\ndata pipelines and data manipulation\ntools like SQL pie torch numpy and the\nlikes a day in the life of a data\nengineer you're building a managing\ncloudbased data set systems using S3\nobject Orient object system block data\noptimizing data storage and access uring\ndata is secure that's number one and\nwhat's the career trajectory like you\ncould move from a senior data from data\nengineer to a senior data engineer role\nto a data architect to a chief data\nofficer that's a sweet\nand you can see the ending potential is\nalso very\nhigh Cloud automation is very similar to\nCR Sr so as I put here so just look at\nCloud automation is just like a trim\ndown version of the SR you you just be\nfocusing on automation right so anything\nthey want to do you want to stop instan\nstart instan launch a thousands or 100\nthousands of servers you're trying to\nautomate that and make sure it doesn't\nfail you're responsible for creating and\nmanaging automated workflows and\nprocesses in power environment so you\njust reduce manual work trying to\nautomate most of the manual o and many\ntime you are releasing an application\nyou need to click on this button you\nwant to automate instead of clicking on\nthat button how can you do this in code\nwith terraform or with Lambda or with\npython with any scripting language of\nyour choice you can see you can work in\na lot of places and you need to have\nsome of the skills that you need to have\nvery similar to the SR deep knowledge of\ncloud platforms scripting knowledge in\nat least one language maybe python bash\nor an automation tools like terraform\nanible Jenkins are very very necessary\nso a day in the life of of an Cloud\nautomation engineer you're automating\nCloud infrastructure deployment writing\nscript to reduce manual tasks and urance\nsystems can skill without having to do\nsome manual\nremediations and what's the career\ntrajectory like so you could go from a\nsenior automation from an automation\nengineer to a senior automation engineer\nto develops lead Cloud operations\ndirector up the way to se Suite we're\nalmost done so cloud product manager you\ncould be helping to work on product\nlaunches so trust me a lot of work goes\ninto product management that may not be\nvisible to the eye just know that these\nare people that are not exactly coding\nor touching systems but actually\ninvolved in more product management\nproject management of the release of a\nparticular service or application so\nthey help plan launch cloudbased\nproducts they work with developers and\ndesigners to ensure the product meets\ncustomer needs and is successful in the\nmarket to the of market research ensure\nthat the product is a is a perfect fit\nfor the customers they're trying to\nMarket it to place you work includes a\nlot of places\nand um you can see there a lot of people\nalmost many companies that that require\nthat use cloud systems to have product\nmanagers right and you need to have\nbasic understanding of cloud\nTechnologies the skills that you need to\nhave now project management is big one\nfor product product managers ability to\ncommunicate with Technical and nonch\ntechnal teams problem solving the ear\npotential is also quite\nhigh and typical day in the life of a\nproduct manager you you work with\nproduct development teams you work with\nEngineers to deliver features you\nprioritize customer needs aligning with\nproducts and business goals in a career\ntrajectory you could go from a product\nmanager Junior to a senior product\nmanager head of products VP of product\nup up the chain up to C sweet Cloud\nnetwork engineer yeah like this ones\nthis ones um the network Engineers\ndesigns maybe hybrid want connect Hy or\nAWS to on Prem how can we connect the\nnetworks together do you use Direct\nConnect or side to side vpns n PLS\ntraffic how do you ensure maybe traffic\nis one way transitive nontransitive\nconnections or your active directory how\ncan you make sure that you have just one\nactive director or distribute domain\ncontrollers across different Cloud\nproviders so nare Engineers help you\ndivine complex Network infrastructure or\nsimple to complex Network infrastructure\nsuch that everyone everything is\ninterconnect you can you can get data\nfrom your database everything can go\nsmoothly so they ensure data can flow\nsmoothly and securely across the cloud\nacross different applications different\nregions in a smooth and and secure\nflexible way and you can see the\ndifferent Industries where you can work\nso you need to have very solid\nunderstanding of networking like rooting\nswitching um OSI model out to\ntroubleshoot basics of power Wars\nnetwork\nsecurity um firewall management\nespecially Cloud platform knowledge and\na typical day in life of a network\nengineer you design and manage Cloud\nsystems ensuring secure and efficient\nnetwork connectivity you TR network\nissues right some users can connect to\nthis database some can connect why is my\ndatabase connection\nfailing what VPN access do I need I'm\nconnected to VPN I can't still access\nsome resources can you allow some ports\nfor me yeah you'll be doing a lot of\nPort man you can also automate this so\nCloud Network Engineers also do some\nautomation at the back end to automates\nmany of these manual attacks I want to I\nneed this sport I need to be able to\ndownload this and give me access you\nwon't be manually going to give access\nyou'll be doing that in an automated\nfashion so from cloud network engineer\nyou could move to senior Cloud network\nengineer Cloud infrastructure engineer\nNetwork and the last one but not least\nwell okay we still have two to go so\nthere's also Cloud migration specialist\nso this this person just helps you do\nmigration many companies are in the\nmiddle of migrations now or some have\njust migrated maybe some are still going\nto migrate a lot some of most of the\napplication eventually the cloud\nto a cloud of migration specialist help\nbusinesses securely move data and\napplications from traditional system\nLegacy systems like Mainframe super\ncomputers that you put on on Prime to\nthe cloud so they ensure the migration\nhappen smoothly and securely without\nlosing data in fact you may have a\ndatabase that is running on Prem and you\nwant migr that dat basally cloud in such\na way that they they can't be you don't\neven have 10 minutes for that cut over\nthe day that you cut over so you need to\nbe need to be active active replication\nhas to be happening so the lot of things\nthey migration Specialists are required\nknowing how to Stage how to Stage the\nmigrations in waves maybe we'll move the\ndatabase systems first and we move some\nweb tier some front end so different\ndifferent um plans goes in\nhere so what are the skills that\nrequired from cloud migration special\nspecialist knowledge of cloud platform\nexperience with Cloud migration tools\nlike migration Hub mg application\nmigration service DRS Disaster Recovery\nService asual migrates and knowledge of\nproject management and risk assessment\nit's also necessary in the cloud\nmigration\nrole right so a day in the life of a\ncloud migration specialist you plan and\nexecute migration of on premises systems\nto the cloud or it might not be on\npremises alone may be from maybe you\nwant to move from Google Cloud to Amazon\ncloud or from Azure Cloud to Amazon\nCloud right so how to move from between\nCloud platform not to migrate away from\nOne Cloud platform to the\nother ensuring minimal time downtime and\nrisk management and troubleshooting of\nmigration issues right so let's move on\nCareer trajectory could go from a cloud\nmigration specialist to a senior Cloud\nmigration specialist to Cloud architect\nto CTO so that's the um and the last one\nnot least is the platform\nengineer a platform engineer builds and\nmaintains the infrastructure that allows\ndevelopers to deploy applications\nquickly in the cloud so think of\ninfrastructure or maybe I have this\napplication I want to run I have\neverything already set up but I just\nneed the platform the infrastructure the\nservers or a collection of the network\nlayout already\ndone the servers already already\nprovision for me to deploy my\napplication so the make sure everything\nis stable and secure for development\nprocess so so the platform Engineers\nwill make sure that the platform the\ninfrastructure that your code will be\nrunning on is already developed before\nthe the devops engineers release their\ncode to the platform so you can see the\nindustries where you can work there\nalmost every industry I know well\nrequire some platform as I said develops\nengineer might actually be doing some\njob work for of of a platform engineer\nso just when you see those platform\nengine rules May on LinkedIn or indeed\non J these are the kind of things that\nthey will be doing not that oh if I\ndon't see platform engineer no I can do\nyou could be a devops engineer and also\nbe doing some some job the work of a\nplatform engineer or be doing all these\nthings yes so companies are small that\nNimo can afford a lot large team so you\nhave to be able to deliver on multiple\nfaets so you need to have deep knowledge\nof cloud platforms knowledge of\ncontainerization the popular\ninfrastructure that customers use ECS\nelastic container service kubernetes\nelastic kubernetes service how to\norchestrate containers in a secure and a\nskillable fashion typical da live\nplatform engineer You're Building Cloud\nplatforms automation automating\ninfrastructure in deploying cloud\nservices ensuring scalability and the\ncareer trajectory could go from platform\nengineer to senior platform engineer to\nplatform lead and then Cloud architect\nEnterprise architect up all the way to\num to become a c s\nexecutive right you can see the ending\npotential is also very very large so how\ndo you get your first role you you need\nto First learn the basics that's why we\nhave a training an\nacademy um that the coort they can join\nwhere you would take it from Novis to to\num to at least you be able to work in as\na professional to a cloud professional\nso you learn how to use at least one\nCloud platform it's AWS Azure Google\nCloud many of these rules the on some of\nthem specify some would give AWS asual\ngood Cloud so they expect to at least\nknow one perform solid because most of\nthem is just the same implementation\njust the names of the services are\ndifferent the same implementation mostly\nacross board but Amazon just has more\nservices what 200 Services others have\nless so you need to know infrastructure\nas how to codify many of these Cloud\noperations that you do on the on the\nconsole you also Master relevant devops\ntools like antio\nterap and Jenkins and the likes so how\nhow can you do that you can volunteer do\ninternship you on write to companies\nstartups that you know that you just\nwant to volunteer to run their Cloud\noperations and join the team so you can\nsee real life What It Takes how how they\nhow they put fires maybe release\napplication is crashing people's money\nare St out to quickly roll back you need\nto get some experience releasing\napplications to that distributed working\nwith distribute applications Le by\npracticing do projects and put it on\nyour GitHub build up your GitHub\nportfolio and also Network connect with\nmentors attend webinars like this use\nyour LinkedIn go for events and you\ngradually you build your your your\nnetwork\nso um I'm going to let uh my colleague\ntake it from here um don't worry we\nstill have a panel discussion where we\ncan take questions you they you have so\nbut this just the first part of the um\nthe webinar and thank you so far for\nbeing with me and for listening\nthank you so much Charles for such a PR\nreally good session very detailed hello\neveryone um thank you all for still\nbeing here for paying attention for\nlistening we are now going to go into\nthe questions I know that I haven't\nheard all of that some of you have all\nsorts of questions and that's exactly\nwhy we're here you know today I have\nwith me Charles and I J like these are\ntop Cloud professionals these are some\nof the finest in the industry so we're\nhere for you we're here to answer all\nyour questions so but I want you to know\nthat every single thing that child spoke\nabout we don't expect that you\nunderstand the Integrity of what\nnetworking is of what protocols are of\nwhat all of this are that's why there is\nopportunity for you to learn from\nscratch and grow and that's exactly what\nwe do at Cloud booster so if you have\nany questions about what you've heard\nwhether you've heard about about Cloud\nbefore or you don't know anything about\nCloud we're here for you we don't expect\nthat you have any background in\ntechnology at all right we have people\nwho have worked with us that have\ntransitioned from nursing into cloud\ncomputing from English Linguistics all\nsorts of backgrounds into cloud\ncomputing so we just want people that\nare passionate ready and we know that of\ncourse for you to go on that Journey you\nwould have questions one of the\nrecommendations that Charles just gave\nwas you know speak to people in the\nindustry have mentors and that's why\nwe're here so we want you to be free\nwant it to be open you know um use the\nslido link ask your questions and we\nwill take it off from there so I'm going\nto be taking all your questions one\nafter the other I'll group similar ones\nof course we expect that there'll be\nsimilar questions but today um I'm going\nto be working with a panel um of course\nyou guys have interacted with Char\nalready so let's have Charles on board\nas well on the spotlight thank you for\nthat beautiful session and of course we\nhave AA at suchu as\nwell um on the call so it's going to be\nthree of\num answering all your questions and\nmyself so I want each of them to\nintroduce themselves I know Charles has\ngiven you a hint into what he does just\n30 seconds you know um you know what's\nyour role and exactly what do you do and\nI as well and I'll introduce myself and\nthen we'll take your question so Charles\nover back to you just 30 seconds\nintroduction okay so um so I'm sure most\nof you heard it when um e introduced me\nearlier but I'm Cloud support engineer\nhere AWS I work with a lot of customers\nGlobal customers help them resolve\nfairly simple to complex Enterprise um\nEnterprise architecture architectural\nproblems op personal problems or even if\nthey want to build guidance on building\nthe Next Generation application um also\nwithin a team where I work with\ncustomers to streamline their Cloud\noperations so I work a lot of cloud\noperations customers want to automate\nhow to manage many customers have\nseveral AWS accounts how to manage it\nmanage it in an organization ational\nformats and showing that they deploy\napplications across similar state to\nmultiple applications yeah I also I also\ndo a lot of work on that side I'm also a\nsubject matter expert for some aw\nservices like systems manager so\nanything systems manager patch\nmanagement um um automation yeah that's\nmy that's my baby that's where I I\nhandle escalations for that so that's\njust a little about what I do in the\ncloud thank you Charles so Charles Works\nin AWS Amazon web\nthemselves he works with them so you can\nimagine his wealth of knowledge in this\nspace I please over to\nyou hi everyone so I'm j e IG for short\nand um I work in BP not like Char I work\nwith the the customers directly of AWS\nand I work as an Enterprise security\narchitect so I'm in cyber security but I\ndid start out with Cloud security and\nnow I'm doing more deaths offs and apis\nand application security also some\ncontainer security as well so I've kind\nof gone around the space of cloud to\nlike the devup side and all but yeah I\nwork more my day today is more like\nmeeting with the finding a like this\ndesigning and recommending strong design\npatterns for certain cloud services like\nour container security our def SEC of\nspace our apis and our absc\ngenerally thank you so much J thank you\nand just similar to Charles and J uh you\nknow I'm also a cloud DeVos professional\nmy name is Gim Sol Jo founder of tuster\nAcademy um I also have my night to5 I\nwork with PWC as a cloud um devops\narchitect right so um within my 9 to5 in\nConsulting I basically help convince a\nlot of organizations to move their\nsystems to the cloud and of course when\nthey need to do those migrations\nbasically just leading on that building\nCloud teams helping organizations to\nmove their systems to the cloud of\ncourse before we even get there there's\na lot of sales that goes on convincing\nthem about the benefits of the cloud and\nall of that of course previously I've\nworked in um Accenture myself and I have\nworked together in Accenture we I've\nalso worked in Capital One where we're\ndoing a lot of hands on actually\nbuilding those solutions back in on the\ncloud as a cloud develops engineer and\nusing a lot of tools that you guys have\nheard about today so we're all very\nhands of been in the industry for over\nhalf a decade and we're here for you so\nI'll just go right into the questions\nokay so um the first question and of\ncourse everyone on the call these are\nyour um instructors and Cloud Boer these\nare people that will be teaching you the\ncloud devs Concepts should do a role in\nthe training so you have um you're in\nsafe hands so now um someone is\nasking um you know can you talk us\nthrough how someone like me with no Tech\nbackground or network I've just\ncompleted the training how do you help\nme secure a job I've just completed a\ntraining did you complete I don't\nbelieve that You' I don't identify the\nname so perhaps you've completed the\ntraining how do you help me secure a job\nhow do you help with interviews right\nand of course some people are asking\nquestions about the cost Cloud booster\ncost what is it all about um some people\nare asking what are the steps and how\nlong will the T training take you know\nsome of you are asking what is the cost\nof the training hello please does the\ntrading fee cover AWS last subscription\nor are we to pay for that separately um\nyou know some people are asking\nspecifically about the training and I'm\njust going to take question about\ntraining I'll actually talk more about\nthe train how much is the train and how\nlong will the training be all the\nquestions to train I'll take it at the\nend right but one thing I'll just say to\nyou is that broad overview what we do at\nCloud booster is that we take you from\nzero into Cloud you don't need any\nbackground in technology and we know\nthat you need more than technical skills\nto actually be a competent Cloud DeVos\nprofessional so we don't just train you\nbecause someone said I just finished\ntraining what do I do next we don't just\ntrain and then leave you right so we\ntrain you we give you um it's virtual\nlive classes every Saturday you get to\nas we're teaching you theoretical\nconcept we teach you the Practical\naspect of it so you have a well-rounded\ntraining for an 18 weeks period it's\nvirtual life classes you can be anywhere\nin the world you join the training on a\nzoom call every Saturday 9:00 a.m. to\nabout 5:00 p.m. BST every Saturday and\nof course you're working You're Building\nSolutions on the cloud and you're also\nbuilding your portfolio so by the end of\nthe training or during the course of\ntraining will start telling you about\nhow you can use your skills to apply for\njob opportunities globally so you're\nputting together we teach you how to put\ntogether your CV we teach you how to put\ntogether your linked profile how to do\ninterviews we give you interview\nsimulation sessions as well oneon-one we\ntest you just to ensure that your job\nready and of course we deploy you into\nyou know the job market so that's really\nwhat training is about and it's for\neverybody so I hope that guides in terms\nof Road Mar so someone is say from a\ncloud Architects perspective what is the\nlargest scope of work when migrating\nworkloads from on premise to the cloud\num I don't know if Charles wants to take\nthat question uh you know what's the\nlargest I find it an interesting\nquestion but yeah someone is asking what\nwhat's the largest scope of work when\nmigrating workloads from on premised to\nthe\ncloud good question so um largest scope\nof work when migrating workload well\nmany customers have trust me a lot of\ndata centers around the world um and a\nlot applications that have different\nmoving components so an application\ntypically is not just on a laptop on a\nserver it might be on different multiple\nservers right scattered across different\nen some data might be resized in in sap\nmight be in S3 might even be in\ndifferent gr plot so firstly many\ncustomers don't even know where all this\ndata are so you need to First analyze\nwhere are the data the data that is used\nall the components of this trust me many\nof those applications are are released\nbefore many of those users join the\ncompanies so not every company has a\nfull full scope full picture big picture\nof where the data is that applications\nthey using dayto day are running they\nknow the operational work but you need\nto first look at it holistically we are\nall the moving parts and developing that\ncould be the lot of tools Discovery\nagents they can use to to quickly get up\nthat AWS other Cloud providers have but\nfirstly developing that holistic view we\nhave all the data recited that need to\nbe moved to the cloud and how do we need\nto how do we stage manager now might\nthink it's easy like okay move database\nthere may be some dependencies there\nsome leg that this this application\ndepends on another one depends on\nanother one so you need to stagger them\nokay which one is the root that if we\nmove this one first other applications\nwon't fail so wave management how to\ndeploy migrate applications or migrate\nmigrate your your data in waves it's a\nvery very very very very tricky one and\nalso risk assessments now during\nmigration some data might get corrupted\nhow do we ensure that okay there's a\nthere's a disaster for Disaster Recovery\nhow do we make sure that okay if\nmigrating we eventually to the cloud\neventually find out that data is\ncorrupted how do we quickly fall back on\npremise so we don't lose money how do so\nit's called risk management so you this\nis also another critical part of\nmigration project so the lot of um it's\nI can't pin which one will be the\nlargest now but I hope this just a\nhandful of areas that you consider and\nyou can give yourself determine okay\nwhich one would actually be a a a a big\npart of it for you but these are just\ndifferent this is not an exhaustive list\ntrust me migration job in fact it'll be\nwe have partners that help with\nmigration migration is not as simple as\njust copying the application code and\nmoving into the cloud a lot of res\ninvestment project management wave\nmanagement that goes into is dependency\nmanagement to remember many companies\nlike big companies have multiple\ndependencies that they themselves don't\neven know so it's your job to help them\nfigure out okay well how the\napplications link together and help them\nto migrate um Sim Lance into the cloud\nwell I've worked with a lot of\nEnterprise customers many times after\nmigrating it crashed it will become\ncorrupted if de commination the pr\nserver how can they proceed so this is\nwhere the class have been class for\nengineers now I have to sweat to try to\nfind ways work around to just bring back\nthe application so that they don't lose\nmoney so that's why you need to make\nsure that the cloud the migration is\nsolid your migration when you do your\nbusiness case for application your\nproject plan is solid so that you make\nto get against such issues sorry I spoke\nI'm very passionate about Cloud so I\nthink I took too long maybe totally\nfine it's totally fine thank you so much\nCharles someone is asking um please how\ncan I get to Charles I want Charles to\nbe a mentor so we're going to put link\nto his LinkedIn profile in the chat box\nso take advantage of that so the next\nquestion I would like to take is which\nproducts are ideal thank you so much for\nyour um response to that um child very\num very extensive um someone is this\nquestion will be for IG which projects\nare ideal for a beginner to implement in\norder to stand out in front of a hiring\nmanager right and you can just use that\nto also touch on anything that can help\nany advice you have for somebody who has\nno Tech background because most people\nare saying what's my road map how do I\ngo from exactly where I am now to\ngetting hired so what are the you know\nwhat projects can they work on what can\nanyone do if they need to move from\nwhere they are right now to actually\nbecoming a cloud developed\nengineer thanks wiy for that I would say\nthat um if you have no idea on cloud if\nyou're coming from a non- te background\num my my recommendation most times is to\ntry and join a program that would help\nyou because the thing is that you can\njust get so overwhelmed with doing a lot\nof things and you're Miss you're just\ndoing a lot of things that just don't\nyou know Target to anything I always\nactually recommend Cloud booster to\npeople personally not because I'm a\ntrainer but because I know that if you\ndon't have a direction and a clear part\nof oh this is where I'm going to next\nyou're going to do a lot of things and\nat the end you'll just be like so\noverwhelmed and have nothing you've done\nyou know it's almost like software\nengineering but software Eng is a bit\nbetter because you can just get an\napplication and write up a code and you\nknow post it on GitHub and you know\ndeploy it somewhere and you know can\ncome with that for cloud it tends to be\na lot more like you need to know where\nyou want to end up in so that you can\nwhen you're writing when you're kind of\ngoing on any projects you're like okay\nI'm going to write I'm going to learn\nthis I'm going to start write want to go\ntowards container okay I want to be a\ncontainer engineer Cloud that's part of\nthe cloud engineer but kind of more\ncontainer specific I'm going to Lear\nthis and write this kind of stuff and\nget this deployed or if you just want to\nbe a normal like you know admin kind of\nengineer you know there are different\npart so my advice on that don't have a\nlike nothing you're just coming from a\nnon-tech background I would say do a\nprogram learning whether you join Cloud\nbooster or I always say join Cloud boost\nit's at least more mentored and more\ntailored right but if you you know\nyou're from coming from a tech\nbackground you already have idea on Tech\nand you just want to kind of like play\naround and get stuffs in then of course\nyou can always like this um this um um\nCloud This Cloud platforms give you free\ncredits to start out with so you can\nalways go on any of this Udi courses CU\nthere are some of them are free and you\ncan just pick up like one course and\nthen just walk through what they are\ndoing and you know get some of their you\nknow they're doing some scalability\nstuff you do it they're doing database\nMySQL you know um that do lamp stack you\ndo it on cloud you know you can always\ndo stuff on your own in Cloud without\nhaving as much Direction but if you're\ncoming from non Tech zero idea I would\nsay join a TA program you probably get\nbetter in terms of where you're going to\nthan just doing any random stuff Tech is\na very information heavy place so you\ncan get very overwhelmed with a lot of\nstuff right so I'll take it easy if\nyou're coming from non Tech I'll say\njoin something that is more tailored if\nyou're coming from already and you have\nan idea or say utilize the cloud\nplatforms because they give free credits\ntake some CES on whether it's UD even\nYouTube even just picking up like oh I\nwant to just do a lamb stack on you know\non on AWS and you could just start out\nwith that and actually end up like you\nknow deploying something and when you go\nfor an interview can you don't just\nwrite on your CV you know deployed in my\nyou know spare my SP time I deployed as\na project I deploy this application as a\nproject and these things are quite easy\nto to spin up and run right so I would\nsay it depends on your path I would just\nsay don't go about doing 101 things at\nthe end where does it tie into you know\nso that would be my own contribution to\nthat\nb thank you so so much J thank you and I\nhope that has answered your question\nplease I hope everyone can still hear me\nI\nthink um question please um you could\njust send me a DM to conf so you can\nhear\nme okay good thank you thought it was\nbreaking all right thank you for\nconfirming okay thank you so much J very\nvery solid so um people are asking about\nyou know I have a question here my\nquestion is will I be able to get a good\njob I'm in my 50s and I'll be Crossing\num from marketing and sales with over 20\nyears experience um I want to combine\nthat with other questions as well\nsomeone else is asking what is my road\nmap to becoming a cloud finops engineer\num and then people are saying that\nsomeone is asking um how can a cyber\nsecurity graduate end up learning cloud\nin the future right um as a new be what\nis the first certification to go for\nlike is it a practitioner certification\nor should I go for associatees you know\num someone is saying that do you need to\nhave a knowledge of coding or\nprogramming language to be a cloud\nsecurity um architect or a CSC um\nsomeone is saying that this sounds like\na very good career part what are the\nchallenges and perhaps some of the\npitfalls of being uh Cloud engineer I\nknow why I'm combining it don't worry\nwe'll take we'll answer it I just want\nto make sure that answers are touching\non everything together and we don't take\ntoo much time someone is saying that can\nyou take us through how someone like me\nwith no Tech background um you know how\ndo I get into Tech okay we're taking\nthat question already which of this\nroles do I need zero coding or\nprogramming language or knowledge to do\nokay um and then someone is saying that\nfor someone who is just transitioning\nwith no previous experience what job\nRoad do you recommend I start with i\nperson ask you what is my journey to\nbecome a cloud network engineer so what\nI see um as a common theme through these\nquestions is people still want to know\nwhat that pathway looks like right\nsomebody is saying that I want to become\na cloud phixs um I want to become a\ncloud security I want to become a cloud\nnetwork engineer and you know how do I\ngo on that journey and what I would say\nis that similarly to what everyone has\nsaid um you know without repeating\nourselves multiple times you need people\nto hold your hands on that Journey right\nyou you don't want to go on that Journey\nalone you need to build your technical\nexpertise you want to become a cloud if\nyou are currently in security you can\ndefinitely go into Cloud I mean I just\nstarted in security before she went into\nCloud right so we have people with that\nexperience so the fact that you know\nsecurity is really good you can layer\nCloud on top of that going into devups\nas well devups is Dev devops and there\nwith security um right at the center of\nit so regardless of where you are right\nnow you want to go from where you are\ninto landing that exciting job whether\nas a cloud network engineer or is a\ncloud devops engineer or is a cloud fups\nengineer you need to build a technical\nexpertise in fact someone is saying that\nI saw a question I said oh how do I\ncombine all of this multiple things that\nyou guys are Spen about because we\ntalked about different different um\ncareer fields in Cloud again my answer\nto that is you need to build your\ntechnical expertise don't think of\nspecializing right at at the beginning\nyou want to learn all the cloud Concepts\nyou want to learn all the devops concept\nand then as you go along you will find\nout which areas are really of more\ninterest to you and you also have to\nlook at what is in the market so you're\nconstantly gauging your skill set what\nyou like and what is in the market right\nand what we found in industry and of\ncourse Charles and I will say as well\nwhat we found in industry is that\nsometimes you even get hired and they\ncall you a particular name oh you're\ncloud data engineer for example and you\nend up doing Cloud devops engineering\nyou end up doing platform you end up\ndoing architecture you know so you know\nyou don't want to be limited that oh let\nme choose something now we're just\nshowing you what is possible the various\npossibilities so you just need to expose\nyourself to these tools to Cloud to um\nyou know different devil tools that that\nmentioned someone that saying that oh\nwhich one does not involve programming\nmy question is why you running away from\nprogramming you know you're running away\nfrom programming because you think it's\ndifficult but it's not that's what we do\nat Cloud we take it from zero right\nwhere you are right now someone is\nsaying I'm a product manager how do I\ntransition you don't need to I mean\ndon't you don't need to run away from\nprogramming right because you can learn\nit from scratch you can understand it\nyou need a bit of programming as a cloud\ndevop engineer it will help you but it's\nnot difficult it's not difficult it's\nsomething you can learn from scratch we\nteach you python you know so and the\nmore rare your skills are the more\ndifficult it is or the more technical\nyour skills are the harder it is to\nreplace you so you want to position your\ncareer in such a way that you have\nskills that people are running away from\nand if you have it it means that\nrecruiters are going to run towards you\nbecause you have the skills that people\nneed okay so I want to um throw the\nquestion open about the pitfall some\npeople are saying oh I'm sure the person\nis like oh you guys are just talking\nabout the good sides you know beautiful\nthings about Cloud what are the pitfalls\nwhat are the challenges so I'll give IG\nan opportunity to answer that question\nof you know and then the next question\nfor child will be what's different\nbetween Cloud someone is asking what's\ndifferent between Cloud architecture and\nyou know Cloud devops you know what's\nthe difference between that Charles can\nanswer that after but I I want you to\ntalk about the pit for someone is saying\nwhat's the pit for what are the\nchallenges don't just tell us the good\nthings tell us the challenges as\nwell say it's a pitfall I'll say it's a\nstrong Challenge and it's for every Tech\nright you need to be up to date you need\nto really be on it Tech is not a place\nwhere you get one thing so I learned\nthis two years ago so I'm here you're\ngoing to really go back quickly so I\nmean for anyone that every time people\nsay oh you know you're in Tech you're in\nSEC you're any money even the child said\nyou're any money you know it's not as\nmuch as any money now is as much as you\nhave to remain up to date for you to\nkeep being valuable right now we're\nhaving a lot of AI so you can't just\nlike oh sorry I only know Cloud it's all\nI do in life no you're going to have to\nkeep up like you have to you know\ncertifications are things you must you\nknow keep up you know updating your\nknowledge keep up being relevant like\nyou can't just sit on your Laurel so I\nw't say it's a pitfall as much as it's a\nchallenge so Tech is not for the lazy\nhearted I know it's Tech have the money\njust for the lazy hearted so you have to\nbe up and up and you know you have to\nplan in yourself okay this is what's\ncoming up I need to go and learn it I\nneed to understand at least I need to\nunderstand what the basic is on it right\nI can't run away from new new things and\nsay this is all I know I just do Cloud\ndevops this is all I know terraform is\nwhat I've been KN you something else\ncomes up newly you need to like jump on\nit and understand it at least you may\ndon't know it like an exp but you should\nbe able to be open to learning so\nactually that's one of the strongest\nthings you must have as a tech person is\nthat um you know willingness to learn\nability to learn actually something that\nis more looked out for in an interview\nthan even all your sometimes your your\nheart your heart skills your experiences\nthat can the person want to learn things\nquickly that's Tech really you know so\nyeah I'll say that absolutely spot on\nthank you so much um Charles can you um\nguide us on the difference I want to say\nwhat's differ between Cloud develops\nCloud architect and Cloud engineering\nand if you can also touch on what\ncertification should people get started\nwith because you have a lot of\ncertifications so you can talk us on\nthat J as well yeah so a cloud architect\ndoesn't do a lot of ant on sorry it\ndoesn't touch systems to maybe use\nterraform to deploy it for the customer\nor using terap to remediate something or\nto change something to flip a feature\nflag or to release a feature right so a\ncloud architect actually takes the\nbusiness requirements maybe you want to\nbuild our own generative air maybe\nStanford says okay in of custom engineer\nor our our prospective applicant come to\na website to see okay when is the\napplication starting or when is the\napplication ending for this cycle okay\nput all that into a model such as an\nagent an AI model an AI agent they can\njust ask the AI agent when is Stanford's\napplication closing right it's very\ndifficult to search websites for that\ninformation you have to click two three\nbuttons find okay what are the\nrequirements to join an gradate program\nso a Solutions architect would take that\nproblem look at different moving parts\nand try develop an architecture\nalgorithm synthesize those service\ntogether make trade-offs maybe there are\n10 things that can do that job and now\ntry to find the most cost effective and\nthat will be able to work for the\ncustomer the customers will be able to\nmanage not all customers are very good\nat managing they may have small teams\nthat they can't manage so it's your job\nas an architect okay which service can\nthey use that they can easily ramp up\nthat won't take them a lot remove a lot\nof I've been sure about so Architects\nthat can overarch and looks at the big\npicture takes the business requirement\nand try to drop like a workable solution\nto to De to to deploy it or to to\ndeliver that particular business outcome\nthat a customer wants so it's a sales\nrole you're taking requirement from\nbusiness and trying to translate into a\nnetwork or an architect technical\narchitecture that the devops engineers\nwill now or developers will run with to\ndeploy right so that's\narchitecture um so devops um Cloud\nengineer or devops engineer okay Works\nclosely with the developers now when\nthey want to release a new code you help\nthem to manage the pack package package\nthat code and help them to release it\nsafely roll it back when necessary and\nalso automate dual infrastructure as\ncode such that the application the\nrelease of the application is automated\nit's not manual you're not copying the\ncode the new code and go and drop it so\nyou can easily roll back you have a lot\nmonitoring in place be able to track\nthat development or roll back love\nalarms in place love alerting as well so\nthat's the develops part cicd\napplication deployment release\nmanagement it's a heavy part of the\ninfrastructure code is heavy part of\ndevops engineer role the last one is\ncloud engineer Cloud engineer is\nholistic can be any um CL Cloud engineer\nmight be a devops engineer so Cloud\nengineer is like a broad term so\ncompanies like Fujitsu Fujitsu UK I know\nthey have a lot of cloud Engineers KPMG\nKPMG has a lot of cloud Engineers if you\njust look at them use it was also on our\nslides here so different companies have\ndifferent terminologies but you might be\ndoing the same Cloud doing everything\ndevops engineer is doing plus Cloud\narchitects\ncompanies small companies if I'm doing a\nstartup I only have one maybe Cloud\nengineer in my team I don't want to have\ndevop setup Network you do everything\nand that worked for me because when I\nwas my previous was a small company uh\nor smaller teams so I was doing\nnetworking doing a Ser Administration do\nso that gave me a lot of when I'm on\ncalls working with lot of global\ncustomers and I'm working with multiple\nteams is it to relate and to send size\nthose information so as a bad team when\nyou're doing a lot of jing a lot of\nthings together as a cloud engineer\ngeneralist yeah I called myself a cloud\nengineer generalist because you need to\nknow how everything fits into each other\nnicely I think those were the three that\nmenion if I miss anyone let me know yeah\nthat's correct and what certifications\nshould people do at the beginning of\ntheir career good so if you're novice I\nrecommend you start with Cloud\npractitioner right but if you're already\nAdvan you're working with it you might\nwant to go straight into Solutions\narchitect now if you want to go into the\narchitect role to be from Solutions\narchitect associate to Solutions\narchitect um um professional your\nknowledge shouldn't stop there you might\nwant to do some Advanced speciality\ncourses security specialist machine\nlearning because as a Solutions\narchitect professional you expected to\nbe professional that this hot\nreverberating on all standards so you\nshould know some Advanced Network and\nadvanced security so nearly never ends\ncertification never say ah once you get\nthe professional H I'm made there's no\ndoesn't work that you keep playing\nAmazon keeps releasing new we release\none AI set I'm also trying to see how I\ncan prepare for that AI set now so if\nyou want to go the architect route\nthat's the that's the angle trajectory\nyou take now if you want to go the um\ndevelops engineer route so you start if\nyou're novice start with a cloud infr\ncloud um practitioner then from cloud\npractitioner you can go to um Cloud\nAssociates well Cloud developer\nAssociates now after Cloud developer\nAssociates I'll will challenge you to\nalso go for the at least the solutions\narchitect associate so you at least know\nmost multiple service not just develop\nServ like dynamodb Sous Services after\num um Solutions architect associate you\ncan now go for devops engineer\nprofessional devops engineer\nprofessional is a very pretty\nchallenging exam and is usually is the\none of the highest certification\nprofessional certification with devops\nengineer so but in the Stream round\nversion will be Cloud practitioner Cloud\ndeveloper associate Cloud devops\nengineer professional but I say you\nknowledge don't stop there you can still\nBranch out to do operations if you're\nworking as a generalist as a develop Eng\nnot just doing developer service you\nbenefit from doing all these others you\ncan even do all the 12 set or the 13\nsets now and get your golden jacket so\nNothing Stops you um learning never ends\nin the world of technology thank you so\nmuch Charles um and um as we wrap up the\npanel discussion I'm going to ask I her\nfinal question so someone is saying that\num you know um I like what a just said\nabout narrowing down your focus I'm\nnever s of being overwhelmed with um\ninfo or feeling stuck um child's\npresentation was helpful with the\ndifferent jobs so I think that's just a\ncomment um thank you for that so hi J\nhow long did it take you to become an\nEnterprise security architect do you\nhave any tips and then um please take\nthat alongside how can a cyber security\ngraduate end up learning cloud in the\nfuture yeah so how long they took me oh\nno maybe six seven years is so I think\nmy role as an Enterprise security you\nknow first of all security security is\none of those High It's Always In Demand\nright and then I think because I had\nCloud very early as well that helped me\nso I I really really um accelerated very\nquickly my career because of my cloud\nbase so it was that when I joined when I\nwas in Cloud was around 2018 2019 so a\nlot of people were moving to cloud and\nit wasn't didn't have a lot CL security\npeople then so it was kind of like oh\nyou know we need to kind of progress you\nquickly because the clients were really\nlooking for my skills I had a client\nthat was like I need three IGS in my\nteam literally that's how she described\nit I want three IGS in my team so it was\nthat kind of like we need them so\nobviously that helps me to get a lot of\nquick range of um view around Cloud\nsecurity quickly and then my role in\nEnterprise security is mainly like death\nSEC Ops abse and all so I'll would say\nit took me about six five to six seven\nyears but I I stay with software\ndevelopment as well cuz that helped me\nin my architectural role right right cuz\nI do dep SEC so I need to understand I\ndo app so I need to really understand\napplications and the details so I it\ntook me that short time normally\nsecurity architect can take you like\nwhen I interviewed for some companies I\nlooked at the architect rules and it's\nsome people it took them 10 years 11\nyears but things go quicker these days\nbecause knowledge also gets you know a\nlot new so AI so an AI security person\nnow will be so like if you really get\ninto AI within two 3 years four years\nyou'll be an expert because a very new\narea so if you get deep into it you will\nbe very highly regarded in fact my\nhusband was telling me about someone\nthat wasn't his field in medical area\nand switch to Ai and the guy is a\ndirector now in fiser literally like his\nhis colleagues are still like small in\nthe field he's gone up to director\nbecause he added something extra to his\nmedical area so it's really important to\nnote that I mean with tech and with\nnewer areas you can get before we used\nto have all this oh an architect takes\n15 years to become an architect that was\nwhen things were slow things are faster\nnow so knowledge is increasing quickly\nso the earlier you catch up getting you\ncan actually really grow quickly right\nso that's why I would say I would say\njust Target five years you can actually\nget there quicker and really if you\nreally really like put your food ground\nto understand things much more in detail\nthen in terms of um sorry what was the\nnext question again with\nme you're mute I can't\nhear I think um how do you end up from\nbeing um you know a security architect\nand then going into cloud in the future\nyeah so I said I would say on knowing\nCloud so you already know security you\njust need to know Cloud right because\nthe thing security doesn't really change\nsecurity is very big I think people\ndon't know that people tend to think\nsecurity is very intense it's not intens\nso it is very basic it has very basic\nprinciples around it what you need to\nknow is cloud so that you can know how\nyou now layer your security knowledge on\ncloud security is always busy security\nis always the same thing like if I give\nyou any Cloud solution I can literally\nthink of top five top six things I'm was\nasking around Security in that area and\nI won't go wrong right so you need to\nnot understand Cloud so that you can be\nable to help them with the security of\ntheir Cloud so if you already know\nsecurity that's good no Cloud if you\nknow Cloud you can actually add up your\nsecurity and your Cloud knowledge\ntogether and actually start helping them\nthen you can always explore\ncertifications that would give you more\nof that in-depth um assurance that you\nunderstand things so like the AWS\nsecurity professional is a very strong\nstart actually G you like one it's in in\nin in the in the world of um Information\nSecurity Professionals it's like a onee\nexperience that getting that s so there\nare some things like that that would\nactually help you to assure and also get\nin depth knowledge of something but I\nwould say no cloud like you already know\nsecurity no Cloud you kind of see that\nyou can layer it on top and understand\nlike you already have basic security it\ndoesn't change you just need to know\nCloud so you can be able to help them\nout with the security of their Cloud\nokay amazing amazing thank you so so\nmuch child and IG very very detailed\nresponses we'll put the links to their\nLinkedIn profile um you know in the chat\nbox as well feel free to connect with\nthem very passionate about you know\nhelping you get into cloud and of course\nyou also meet them at Cloud booster as\nwell so that brings us to the end of our\npanel session can you say thank you to\nCharles and a for such a wonderful time\nand for answering your questions thank\nyou so much from all of us at Cloud\nbooster um you know we appreciate you so\nthe final wrap up I just want to answer\nall the questions around people are\nasking what's the rote what does my\njourney look like some of you are saying\nI'm I'm I'm over 50 I'm younger than 16\nthere is no age restriction to learning\ncloud computing um some of you are\nsaying you've had issues with payments\nplease send a DM to any of program\nadvisors if that is you um we have\npayments available in various currencies\nbut I just wanted to show you you know\nwhat your journey to cloud computing\nwill look like for those that are asking\nright I want to show you what your\njourney will look like now if you enroll\nfor the training because we're starting\na new court um next\nmonth and basically in two weeks time so\nand it's an 18 weeks Journey so by\nNovember right you're going to\nunderstand the basics of cloud computing\nstill in the month of November you're\ngoing to be exposed to storage Services\nwe talked about networking earlier today\nCharles mentioned it the same month of\nNovember you will um you know you will\nbe exposed to various kind of networking\non the cloud and by December this year\nyou'll be able to build um you know\ncomputers on the cloud we call it is2\nAWS is2 instance you will be able to\nbuild that okay still the same December\nyou'll be exposed to databases you'll be\nexposed to high availability and how to\nbuild resilient architecture on the\ncloud how to build systems on the cloud\nthat never fail that never go down and\nby January you'll be looking at security\non the cloud which we spoken extensively\nabout today how do I ensure that my\ncloud services are secure right by\nJanuary and of course still the same\nmonth of January you'll be looking at\nscripting as well we've talked about the\nimportance of prr programming um you\nknow we're going to be exposing you to\npython scripting bat scripting lenux\nscripting still in the same month you'll\nbe looking at Version Control which is a\nvery powerful Concept in the world of\ncloud computing you know G and GitHub\nhow do you use that by February you're\ngoing to be exposed to infrastructure as\ncode um child spoke about it as well\nterraform you will be looking into\nDocker containerization in February\ncontainer orchestration using kubernetes\nand of course by March you'll be dealing\nwith cicd pipelines on Jenkins and\nconfiguration Management in anible I\ndon't expect that you understood all\nthose technical terminologies that's why\nyou're coming to us at Cloud booster we\nwill take you from scratch some of you\nare asking what does program untila let\nme walk you through what that is it's an\n18 weeks program it is virtual you don't\nneed to come to any physical space\neverything will be done online you just\nlog into to zoom every Saturday 9:00\na.m. to 5:00 P p.m and you're in class\nso what is part of your comprehensive\nCloud develop training is your intro to\nCloud devops course right we have very\nlovely recorded videos in house you know\nwith a lot of Animation that explains\nvery different Cloud concept which you\nwould have as um you know resources that\nwould that you would work with while\nyou're attending um sessions every\nSaturday and then we have weekly live\nclasses we give you one-on-one\nfacilitator support at Cloud booster so\nyou're not alone for example if you have\na class of 20 30 50 students after we\nteach you those Concepts in class we\ndivide you into groups and in those\ngroups that's when you build your\nSolutions on the cloud we ask you share\nyour screen let's see what you're doing\nlet's see how we can support you because\nwe know that you need more than just\nexposing you to information to actually\nknow how to do the job you need to build\nit right in front of us and we marking\neverything we're tracking what you're\ndoing we're recording it you know you\nhave fully guided Labs as well some of\nyou are asking you know what kind of\nprojects do I get to work on AWS\nstandard projects devops projects\nindustry standard projects that you put\ntogether add it to your CV and you help\nyou learn the opportunities that you\nwant that's what people that have you\nknow been a part of cloud booster that's\nwhat they've done and of course AWS\ncertification exam Readiness materials\nwith do exam simulation sessions for you\nas well you have additional resources\nyou have a learning community we do\nemployability training C reviews Mark\ninterview sessions and of course after\nthe training there's a lot of followup\ninvolved as well the training that will\nprepare you for our Cloud booster is the\nAWS Cloud architect Cloud Solutions um\nSolutions architect training by the end\nof your training with us you'll be able\nto take that exam and of course we put\nyou on a path where you are able to you\nknow keep learning and you keep growing\nyour skills so after training with us at\nCloud booster you'll be able to use the\nfollowing Technologies AWS as your major\ncloud provider of course you can learn\nother ones in the future but we want you\nto learn one first and then you learn\nother ones in the future you can learn\nother ones as you go along once you know\none Cloud platform right you can learn\nevery other one and child spoke about\nearlier as well so the Technologies you\nbe able to use AWS python linox anible\nterraform DOA Jenkins GitHub kubernetes\nelk
