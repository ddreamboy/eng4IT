  "text": "I came across a resource that shows the\nmost popular and fastest growing open\nsource security projects on GitHub in\nthis explained video we're going to look\nat the top five most popular projects\nfrom that very list and at the end of\nthe video I'll share the link so they\ncan see all the top 100 projects now\nbefore we get started it's interesting\nto note that the most commonly used\nlanguage for these projects by quite a\nbig margin is python after that it's a\nclose race between go and JavaScript and\nfinally C and typescript now the\nprojects are even broken down by\ncategory and the top two are identity\nand application security after that we\nhave Cloud security and then network\nsecurity and finally vulnerability\nmanagement but with that out of the way\nlet's go ahead and dive in with the\nfifth most popular open source security\ntool which is called psyllium psyllium\nis a cloud security tool that provides\nsecure network connectivity between app\nServices deployed using containers like\nDocker or kubernetes psyllium consists\nof an agent that's running on all the\ncluster nodes and servers in your\nenvironment it provides networking\nsecurity and observability which is a\nhard work to say to the workloads\nrunning on that node workloads can be\ncontainerized or running natively on the\nsystem it's really not surprising to see\ncontainer in kubernetes projects in the\ntop five because of how many\norganizations are using containers the\nnext tool in spot number four is mitm\nproxy which stands for man in the middle\nproxy if you're familiar with man of the\nmiddle attacks then you probably know\nwhere this is going this is an\ninteractive intercepting HTTP proxy for\npenetration testers and software\ndevelopers that's capable of supporting\nTLS connections this project also\nincludes a web-based interface called\nmitm web and a command line version\ncalled mitm dump which is just like TCP\ndump but for HTTP once installed we can\nuse it to intercept requests modify\nrequests replay requests Etc so this is\nessentially a much more portable and\nsimpler version of using the burp or\nOlas zap proxy feature the primary\nbenefit here is how flexible of a tool\nthis is which means that you can use it\nfor a variety of use cases and obviously\na lot of people see that value because\nthis project has 31 000 stars now this\nnext one is a tool that I'm sure you've\nprobably heard of if you've ever worked\nwith web applications or anything\nrequiring TLS openssl is a tool that is\nand has been massively popular because\nit's a cryptography and TLS toolkit that\nyou can use to create and manage\ncertificates and encryption of all kinds\nso in short you can think of this as a\nSwiss army knife for cryptographic tasks\ntesting and Analysis now in the second\nspot we have a Secrets management tool\nfrom hashicorp called Vault Vault fits\nin the identity category because it's a\ntool for creating and managing Secrets\nencrypting as a service and access\nmanagement you can use it for API Keys\npasswords certificates tokens and a\nwhole bunch more you can even use it to\ngenerate Dynamic instead of static\nSecrets which means that you can use it\nto generate secrets on demand for things\nlike databases or even Cloud resources\njust to name a couple of examples now I\nmade a full video explained meaning what\nvault is and how it works in my\nexplained Series so check that video out\nif you're interested finally in spot\nnumber one and I don't think too many of\nus are going to be surprised by this one\nwe have the metasploy framework\nMetasploit is an exploitation framework\nthat's used for pen testing and that's\nmaintained by rapid 7 and The Open\nSource Community anyone who has any\nremote interest in pen testing will have\nheard of metasploits Because the\nInternet is flooded with tutorials on\nhow to use this framework and for very\ngood reason it's a super powerful and\nimpressive framework that can do a whole\nlot it's so powerful in fact that you\ncan even use it to write your very own\nexploits or use Community exploits and\nif you're interested in learning more\nabout metasploits my recommendation\nwould be to start with their\ndocumentation and then after that check\nout YouTube tutorials because there are\nplenty out there to get you going okay\nso as promised here's the entire list of\n100 different top projects at open\nsource security index.io by the way this\nlist is constantly changing even from\nthe time that I found this resource to\nthe time that I recorded this video two\nof the top five moved around so by the\ntime that you watch this the top five\nmay have changed if you enjoyed this\nvideo please like the video and\nsubscribe for more content just like\nthis and then let me know in the\ncomments below which of these tools you\nhadn't heard of but that you're now very\ninterested in learning more about thanks\nfor watching and see you in the next\nepisode\n",
