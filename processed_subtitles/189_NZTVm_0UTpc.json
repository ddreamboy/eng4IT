  "text": "[Music]\nhi I'm an automatic translation system\nnow my head used to be full to bursting\nwith vocabulary lists and grammar rules\nand my progress was slow and all of\nthose rules and exceptions gave me a\nheadache\nI couldn't translate new words and my\nsentence structure wasn't always right\nand this caused problems translated\nmessages were often misunderstood and\nusers became unsure about their\ninteractions with me\nbut now I use a neural network which\nmeans I learn from lots of examples I\nlearned from novels and their\ntranslations translated subtitles\nmultilingual websites and so on and I\ndon't like to brag but I can process\nmore text than anyone could read in an\nentire lifetime\nwith this mass of information my neural\nnetwork can learn how to translate and\nas with all computer systems the\ninformation must first be converted into\nnumber sequences also known as word\nvectors\na word Vector places each word on\ndifferent axes in a multi-dimensional\nspace\nwords that are somehow related to each\nother are closer together in that space\nthan words that are unrelated\nI can easily work with a space of up to\na thousand Dimensions now try getting\nyour head around that all those numbers\nrepresent different aspects of meaning\nwhich in an abstract way allows me to\nunderstand the meaning of words before I\nstart translating I study the whole\nSource sentence because of all the\ninformation I gathered about words I\nknow how they connect with each other\nand this means that I make fewer and\nfewer grammatical mistakes\nsometimes I don't have enough\ninformation about particular words in a\nsentence to work out the correct meaning\nwhen that happens I use the most\nfrequent translation which is useful but\nby no means foolproof\nbut if you give me a sentence with more\ncontext I usually manage to provide an\naccurate translation\nI also find it easier if two languages\nare similar so I can do a better job of\ntranslating from Italian into Dutch than\nfrom say Chinese into English all the\ninformation I process helps me to become\nthe best version of myself\nand the better I become the more I can\nhelp all of you to communicate with each\nother as effectively as possible but to\nbecome even better I need a lot more\ninformation I know about 200 languages\nso far but there are almost 7 000 in the\nworld and on top of that I'm not as good\nas I'd like to be at translating\ncreative language for this and other\ndifficult tasks I prefer to work with\nlanguage professionals would you like to\nknow more then have a look at the\nfollowing website\n[Music]\n",
