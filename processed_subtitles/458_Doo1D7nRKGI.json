  "text": "hello and good afternoon thanks everyone\nfor being here uh welcome to AWS on air\nyou're here in joining myself and Todd\nfor our show today talking about new and\nupcoming AWS services so I uh my name is\nFiona I am a Solutions architect at AWS\nI work in the public sector specifically\nwith nonprofits and I do a lot of\nresponsible AI stuff and excited to be\nhere with\nTodd hi Fiona thanks for hosting with me\nthis is our first time hosting de no it\nis have you been excited for it I've\nbeen excited for it I am twice as\nnervous as I normally am this going to\nbe know I'm pretty scared I've heard\nthat hey everybody I'm Todd Fortier I'm\na Senior Solutions architect here at AWS\nwhere I focus on developing Solutions\nand what we call the AWS Solutions\nLibrary if you've never heard of that go\nto aws.amazon.com\nSolutions you can see all the kind of\ncool stuff that I get to work on every\nsingle day uh but yeah I'm excited uh\nfor today's episode I am we're going to\nbe talking about something that I talk a\nlot about in\nconversations yeah this idea of zero ETL\nand what is that how is does it mean how\ncan we make it better for people how can\nwe make the process simpler I think we\nmight learn a thing or two about that\ntoday this isn't our only show though so\nthis is AWS on air it's the flagship\nshow where we talk about AWS um overall\nthat we do have some other shows Todd do\nyou have a specific favorite show that\nwe that we do yeah I usually say a the\nAWS on Air Sports show with our producer\nNick is my favorite I'm a sports guy not\nall sports some sports I like show when\nwe talk about the NHL and some of the\nNerds and the stats that we're throwing\nat different sports uh but I'm starting\nto think maybe I should get into uh the\nstartup show if you're a startup you're\nstarting a company want to know how to\nuse cloud services at AWS to to do that\num we have a show with Jillian who hosts\nthat what other show yeah I mean it's\nfunny you said that your favorite was\nSports I was gonna say my favorite is\nanything you know but the sports show\nthat's just because it's it's Nick\nhosting I have a special place in my\nheart for game day am's show um step up\nyour game day that was my first show\nthat I ever got to guest on but you know\nit's hard to compare them all it's like\napples to oranges so I think they all\nhave their own their own benefits yeah\ngame day kind of stands unique in the\nsense that like I had never heard of\nwhat what a game day is is some sort of\nwhat what I think it's described as a\ndanger room but like a digital danger oh\nlike an escape room yeah like an escape\nroom where you have to sort of get your\nway out or earn points by different\nmissions and different things and in the\nin the process you learn how to use AWS\nI like it's a super cool idea yeah it is\npretty fun and they're all like unicorn\nthemed which I think is pretty funny\nit's funny I actually just did my first\never actual like non AWS escape room\nyesterday but for a team bonding\nexercise with my AWS team we had to\nescape a tomb it was it was hard for us\nmy te get out or did I mean obviously\nyou got out you're here\ntoday well it was actually virtual so my\nteam is all over the place so it was\nlike some online site that does virtual\num Escape rooms that's pretty neat hey\nwell uh this is not going to be that\ntoday you can uh if you're tuning in you\nare allowed to leave but we may ask you\nwe actually want to\nknow you have yeah we want to know where\nyou're uh where you're calling from\nthat's not a thing we're on Twitch you\ncalling from where you're listening in\nfrom uh have you done a game day before\nif you have what did you think of that\nuh let us know we're going to be\nmonitoring the chat we want to know what\nquestions you have for our guests as\nthey come on um I think should have a\ngood amount of people from Germany\nCanada and the UK today um shout out to\nthe UK specifically I'm a UK citizen\ngood day no that's Australia I was gonna\nsay good day mates but that's the wrong\ncountry\nhello yeah there it is\nbetter this this is going off the rails\nI think we've got to get to our first\nsegment here I think this is the to\nbring in our our first guest and uh talk\nuh zero eail so Nick why don't you go\nahead and bring him\nup hello hello welcome ainov and Shaz if\nyou want to go ahead and introduce\nyourselves to everyone that would be\ngreat hello hello hello my name is Abad\nhun and I am a product management lead\non the Amazon Aurora team\nhey my name is Shaz Faro and I am a\nproduct manager on Dynamo\nDB nice hey welcome to the show uh cool\nexcited to have you so today we're going\nto be talking about uh what are we gonna\nbe talking about today zero ETL what you\nwere just confused about a few minutes\nback okay so so alleviate our confusion\nhere what do we mean when we say Zer ETL\nhere at AWS so zero ETL is a strategic\nVision which AWS is working on across\nthe board and it essentially takes away\nthe overhead for some of our data\nmanagement folks on the call by removing\nthe need for building and maintaining\ncomplex data pipelines and it helps you\ndo uh personalizations so if Fiona loves\na certain color of car you could have\nthat data stored in one database but\nthen you could analyze it in one of the\ndata LS to say hey Fiona loves red\ncolored car and that helps very easy or\nthat makes it very easy for all the data\nmanagement folks yeah so we so ET just\nto break this down a little bit even\nmore uh extract transform and load these\nare things that you typically do uh with\ndata to get it from one source to a\ndifferent def destination and it needs\nto be reflected in a certain format in\nthat destination so how do you change it\nand move it along and you're saying at\nAWS we want to get to a place where we\ndon't have to do that it's so easy to\nmove data from one place to the other\nthat you don't need ETL processes\nanymore hence zero ETL you got it go\nTodd I've been paying\nattention hey looks like we have a\ncomment saying it's an interesting topic\nI love to hear that everyone else is\njust as excited about it as we are I\nthink it'll be pretty great and so we\nhave two different um locations that\nwe're grabbing data from today as we're\nloading them into red shift so maybe do\nyou guys want to kind of tell us a\nlittle bit about each of your specific\norigin\nlocations yes so I work on auto\npostgress which is a fully compatible\npostgress engine and we are able to send\ndata from your operational oltp workload\nwhich is a structured data set and get\nit into red shift and we have several\nexciting capabilities which we talk\nabout in few minutes awesome yeah and uh\nyou know I work on Dynam DB so dynb is\nuh no SQL uh database primarily targeted\nfor building applications at scale with\nvery low lat see so you you're talking\nabout internet scale applications some\nof these streams that are actually also\nrunning on Dynamo DB today um so the the\nidea is that a lot of data actually\nlives in Dynamo DB but doing analytics\nis not uh primarily the Forte of that\nservice so you would want to have an\neasy way of doing analytics by these\neasy to setup Integrations nobody wants\nto manage pipelines so you know we kind\nof take care of all of that work behind\nthe scenes to move your data from Dynamo\nDB in into a more structured analytics\noptimized format in red shift so you can\ndo your analysis run machine learning\nmodels Etc okay got it so it's so we've\ngot three different places that data\nmight be sitting as we're talking about\ntoday we have Aurora which um is going\nto be you know structured data that\npostest data that you'll be talking\nabout we have Dynamo DB which you\nmentioned is kind of Internet scale data\nand then we're going to be showing two\ndifferent ways to feed that data into\nred shift which is more um large scale\nand for data\nanalytics than yeah that's going to be\nmy question so why would I want to do\nthat why would I not just run analytics\noff my source databases why would I want\nto move that data to Red shift because\nit takes a lot of your compute overhead\nso imagine if you are serving Peak if\nyou were Netflix and you were serving\nshows at the peak of evening what and\nyou wanted to also know hey like Todd is\nwatching Netflix but I also want to know\nwhat else can I recommend to him you\ndon't want to bombard your database\nwhich which is storing that data to know\nhey like what is my personalization for\nto right and at the same time mapping\nthis or doing this in a olp database\nsuch as Aurora or Dynam it is not\noptimized for analytical purposes like\nShaz was mentioning so you need to have\ncertain machine learning model certain\nuh Integrations around data masking or\ncreating uh materialized view which\nhelps you do this better in a analytics\nsystem such as red shift another one is\nwe are only talking about two we have\nmultiple Integrations so we also support\nthis for Aurora MySQL and RD is for\nMySQL so imagine if you had like 15\ndifferent sources you can't individually\nrun it in those sources you need to get\nit in a central data Lake type setting I\nsee so like why as you explaining that I\nwas thinking like well architected this\nis how I get closer to a well\narchitected workloads where I am not I\ncan think about the operational\nefficiency and the performance and the\nscalability of my data uh so that I'm\nnot just overkilling my services or\ndegrading some experience and some other\naspect of what I'm delivering that's\nreally cool so you're going to show us\ntoday what exactly you going to show us\ntoday you're going to show us how easy\nthis is to do we will show you both of\nus will show you how in few clicks you\ncan take away the overhead of doing\nsomething similar in days or sometime in\nmonths and we'll try to see how quickly\nboth of us can do it okay yeah so we've\ngot before we get into it I've got we\ngot some people coming in we're live\nwe're going to take some try to feel\nsome questions we have a question coming\ninto the chat right now I'm just\nnoticing it Judy Levi I think is the\nname a great addition to Aurora\npostgress squel do you support Json B\ndata type to Red shift super data type\nso it looks like some data type\nconversion question yes so in general we\nare able to map your data types\nautomatically from aora postest into red\nshift jsonb is one of the things which\nwe are working on support for and it\nshould be available in the next uh\nrelease Okay cool so I think you guys we\nsay demo time we need to have like a\nsong that plays every time we're like\ndemo time demo time okay let's bring\nthat demo no pressure no\npressure so we see all right so you'll\nget us started yes so we'll start with\nthe Aurora post integration so I'm I\njust have another screen Fiona and Todd\nI still have your full attention so I'm\njust going to show you where we are\nstarting so we are starting on a very\nfamiliar RDS console page right and for\nyou to create any integration you just\ngo to this pane on the left side which\nsays zero ETL integration and this\nessentially shows you step by step the\nthree main steps don't get overwhelmed\nwe will handle it for you it essentially\nis trying to get your Aurora postest\ndatabase ready first then it is letting\nyou select your red shift data warehouse\nand finally you just click a create\nbutton and your integration is created\nso let's yeah sorry so let's try to\ncreate an integration so because this is\nan AWS on air show we will try to create\nan AWS on a demo\nand we will try to move on with a quick\ndescription and here now we are going to\nselect a RDS database which is an aurora\npostgress so I have kind of data do you\nhave in this database yes so we have\nsome ticket reservation data in this so\nthis already holds like some data around\nusers events uh some date and that we\nwill see how it shows up in the r side\nso I already have an Aurora post\ndatabase engine here and it is running\non version 16.4 so remember 16.4 you\nneed to be on there and then 16.4 so\nthen we selected a uh I'm seeing a fixed\nparameter values pop up here yes so good\ncatch I thought you would skip it so is\nis like I said you need to get your\ndatabase ready to send data and for that\nyou need to set up some parameter groups\nmainly around what we call as enhanced\nlogical replication which is our\nInnovation uh to Todd's question why\ndon't you want to do it on ltp side we\nmake it faster by having a dedicated\nstorage layer so all of those settings\nwould be set up for you and all I need\nto do is just do this fix it for me\nbutton and this will require your reboot\nso Todd don't do it when you are\nwatching Netflix shows do it when the\ndatabase is got busy then we just are\ngoing to cherry pick certain databases\nand schema and how I do this is I'm just\ngoing to specify a filter here so what\nI'm doing here is for the postest users\nhere is I'm selecting a database and\nthen I'm doing while cards which\nessentially will pick every schema and\nevery table within the database and then\nfor the second database I'm going to\njust pick schema one and all the tables\nfor schema one right but then that is\nfor including right but what if I also\nalso want to exclude certain things\nright you don't want to say send out\nyour personal data or a social security\ndata so I'm just going to add like a\ntable here which is date next I go to it\nis going to ask for my permission so I'm\njust going to confirm that I'm okay to\nreboot my cluster now it asks me for my\nred shift data warehouse so let's select\none here I this is where we're sending\nit to yes this is the point a and this\nis the point B so we did the point a now\nwe are talking about point B I see\nanother popup\nyes\nF see Pop Up clearly like Hawke eyes so\nwhat you're seeing here is that it is\nasking us for permission that we don't\nhave the required direct shift principle\nsetup on that database house and then we\nalso don't have the case sensitivity\nsetup right don't worry no sweat we will\njust again select fix it for me when in\ndoubt Fiona just CLI fix it for me and\nwe'll figure it out then we just again\ngive a acceptance it will show you a\nsummary of what we are changing a quick\nsummary if you want to add optional tag\nand encryption settings uh by the way\neverything is end to end encrypted all\nthe time so we have end to end\nencryption both in transit as well as\nrest but this is if you want to provide\nyour own key because some of our\ncustomers do do that and finally we get\nto this fancy screen which shows you a\nsummary that this is the integration we\nare creating this is the source which we\nselected these are the fins which we set\nup and then these are the parameter\nchanges which the integration will make\nfor you the four which we need to and\nthen finally we have the target here\nwhich is the point B and then we have\nthe parameter settings around case\nsensitivity and then I need to just\nclict on this create zal integration all\nright and so how long does it take to\nget from Aurora tread shift so it will\ntake depending on your data set side it\ncan take anywhere from few minutes to\nlike maybe like an half an hour in\ngeneral uh but we don't have half an\nhour so I thought ahead we do have\nsomething already set up so let's see a\nalready set up integration so we will go\nto my dashboard and this is a\nintegration which is already set up\nsimilar to before and you can see those\nsame filters Fiona if you remember\nHawkeye so this is the same filter 16.4\nI remember that yes yes so we have that\nso let's see how this shows up in red\nshift right so let's go to a red shift\nconsole now and we go to the Zer ATL\nintegration tab similar to before and\nthen we click on this tab real quick and\nthis shows up here and let's just\nquickly run a query here so if you\nremember what we sent here I'm just\ngoing to show it so you have a demo here\nyour schema one showed up here right so\nyou have your seven tables and then\nlet's look at demo db2 so we only sent\nschema one here so if you remember there\nshould be six tables and then one table\nis excluded now let's just quickly show\nhow we can pull the data so this is a\nvery similar simple query which you can\nsee\nhere but Fiona you might be wondering AB\nso how quickly does this happen how how\nmuch exact how did you know that's what\nI was wondering that was exactly what I\nwas wondering how much time do you think\nit will take if I made a change on the\nAurora side for it to show up here just\na guess um let's say an\nhour okay let's challenge that one hour\nwell we don't have an hour so I have a\nchallenge for you why don't you take out\nyour phone with a timer on and when I\nsay go you go okay yes all right right\nso just a quick check we have ra John\nhere staying in San Francisco which is\nin California so what we are going to do\nis relocate John from San Francisco to\nNew York okay I simple I also show you\nto start I'll tell you I'll tell you so\nright now in AO right showing in San\nFrancisco let's send him to New York and\nwhen I say go you go okay I'm locked in\nand 1 2 3 go okay so I have executed the\nquery now let's go to Red shift it still\nshows a San\nFrancisco and let's refresh and how much\ntime\nstop it was under it was under 9ine when\nI said stop I was looking okay okay I\nwas a little\ndelayed know hey so wait time out time\nout let me recap cut something here real\nquick we started with data in postgress\nyes and we set up an ETL from postgress\nto Red shift you're now querying in red\nshift and what you're suggesting is from\nthe time you changed it in Aurora over\nhere the source the time it zero eted\ninto the destination less than 10\nseconds yes and what better we do this\nfor 24 million operations within 10\nseconds that's amazing so we are able to\ndo something similar and just to prove\nwhat I was saying this is our end to end\nreplication lag and it was two seconds\nso the time which you saw is 10 was more\naround just me swi between Windows so\nit's actually 2 seconds which it took\nfor it to replicate but I know Shaz also\nwants to show us some fun so Shaz why\ndon't you show us the Dynamo DB site\nlike two PS in a pod we are up next on\nDynamo DB let's bring it Shaz let's see\nwhat you\ngot yeah uh so I'm going to I'm going to\nquickly walk through the Dynamo side of\nthe demo uh so similar to what abinav\nwas talking about the idea of zero ETL\nsetup is very similar like we want to\nmake sure it's a few clicks so\nuh I'm in the dynamodb dashboard I have\na table um I've already imported some\ndata uh from the stock market it's easy\nto understand so um on the dyo console\nwe have a new integration section so uh\nsimilar concept you know we will prepare\nthe data the data is going to be sent to\nthe Target service and then you can just\ndo the querying on the target service um\nso I go to the create integration\nsection and then I click on red shift by\nthe way Dynamo DB has another\nintegration which is open search which\nhas been out for for a while so this is\na new uh offering that we just launched\nrecently so when I click on uh create a\nred shift integration uh you would see a\nvery similar um walkth through of how to\ncreate an integration so I'm going to\ncall this AWS on air uh any\ndescription any you want to bet that\nunderscore is going to give you a\nproblem oh\nyou guys are paying\nattention all right so um and then I'm\ngoing to browse the Dynamo DB table so\nI'm going to click on the stocks import\ntable and then click next and then I see\na call out there you go so this morning\nmy vision's incredible we need to have a\nfix it for me button across all of AWS\nthat's amazing just I like that I I like\nthis new pattern as well um so basically\none of the things that we do on the dyb\nsite differently is that we actually\nwant want to make sure that it has no\nimpact on your production tables so we\nuse exports which are always isolated\nfrom your uh production traffic so you\nknow if you're running large internet\nscale applications this process is going\nto have no impact on that um so for that\nyou need to enable point in time\nrecovery uh which is another feature of\nDynam DB and we apply some permissions\non the resource policy directly for you\nso uh you click fix it for me um and\nthen you go to the next page where\nyou're selecting your Target warehouse\nso um I've been using serverless uh so\nred shift you can use either a provision\ncluster or serverless uh it depends on\nyou know what you uh what fits your use\ncase uh serverless is just easier for me\nto set up so I I select uh the\nserverless U red shift cluster uh again\nwe have some optional optional\nparameters that you can put in there you\ncan tag it uh and also it's always end\nto end encrypted but if you want to\nchange the encryption you have the\noption to do that here going to click\nnext and then it'll give you a\nconfirmation screen of just reviewing\nyour details one thing that is different\nfrom uh Aurora is that in Dynam DB you\ndon't have a concept of databases it's\njust tables so you just have tables and\nwe're replicating one table into red\nshift so I'm going to click on create\nthe dynb integration um and because the\ninitial setup uh does a full export of\nDynamo DB it depends on how large your\ntable is it can take between like you\nknow depending on your uh the size of\nthe table it may take a few hours to a\nfew minutes um so I already have another\nintegration setup which I I'll show you\nwhat uh how that looks like so once you\nhave that setup um you can go to the\nIntegrations Details page you will see\nthe status as active and you will see\nthe database State as active as well I\njust want to quickly call out that we\nhad a hilarious comment from Robert\ntables that said tables you\nsay that was funny great okay sorry\ncontinue yeah um yeah um what one more\nstep that I actually wanted to show uh\nso when you're creating the integration\nyou also have to attach a red shift\ndatabase uh so when as you're going\nthrough the step we actually walk you\nthrough it uh it's as simple as just\nclicking here I'm going to put this as\nAWS on\nair um click create\ndatabase and then it'll\nstart yep you you'll see the database\nState as creating so give this a few\nminutes uh we'll let that one run but\nI'll come back back to the one that I\ncreated earlier uh your database state\nis active uh in on this page you you you\ncan see some statistics so on the\ndynamodb side because we're using\nexports uh the lag is not as flashy as\nwhat abina was showing us so we're\ntalking about around 15 to 30 minutes so\nuh the use cases that we want to serve\non this side are more of like you know\naggregated analytics or business\nintelligence use cases we're not uh\nprimarily targeting operational\nanalytics so uh within 15 to 30 minutes\nyou'll see the data as it shows up in\nDynamo DB probably not gonna time that\none right\nnow do we have minutes left as so I want\nto make sure you get to everything you\nwant to get to yep absolutely okay so\nnow the fun part so I think once your\ndata lands in uh your red shift cluster\nuh I've already set up some queries just\nto kind of show you what it looks like\nuh oops my connection is closed let me\njust quickly happens real time you got\nto refresh that connection\nI just want to confirm something we had\na comment in here that I wanted us to\nconfirm that this this concept works for\nred shift serverless as well and I think\nthat's what you were showing right you\nspun up a serverless red shift uh\ninstance and that's where you were\nmoving data to and that's what we're\nquerying now that is correct yes you can\nuh you can do it on a provision cluster\nas well but serverless is the new uh I\nwould say it's easier to set up for sure\num so so the way that the data shows up\nbecause Dynam DB is semi- structured uh\nwe have a partition key as one column\nyour second column is a sort key and\nyour third column is a Json super column\ntype right so it has all the other data\nuh uh that is sitting in Dynamo DB so uh\nthe way you want to query this is so I I\ncreated a query where I I'm looking at\nall the highs for the different stock\ntakers for a day uh got to refresh this\nagain there you go there we go so this\nreturns all of the uh it it's parsing\nthrough the Json super column type and\nit's returning all of the highs for each\nindividual stock for a particular day so\nit's very suitable for you to do ad hoc\nquerying uh you know you don't have to\nrely on Dynamo DB Dynamo DB can take\ncare of your operational uh application\nworkload and then on the side you can\nenable your data Engineers or you know\nall the analysts to just go at it uh\nwithout impacting your Dynam VP workflow\nyeah so you mentioned something so\nthere's a little bit of uh like you have\nto go from semistructured to structured\nand then understand differences in\nquerying I know with Dynamo DB we're\ntalking sort keys and partition keys and\nthen over here or yeah we're and then\nhere we're talking something different\nso but what you just saw what I want to\ncall out is like how much how fast you\ncan query this data especially when you\nhave large amounts of dat is coming in\nhere how fast red shift's going to\nperform in these types of aggregate or\ncomplex periods it's pretty cool yeah\nyeah red shift is primarily built for\nthese type of workloads right so you you\ncan Leverage The Power of uh you know\nred shifts querying capabilities to do\nAdvanced analytics and you know machine\nlearning so you you you would offload\nall of those workloads on red shift and\nyou know make sure that you're enabling\nthat side of your business without uh\nimpacting anything on your operational\nside on Dynam we got we got some\nquestions coming in here this is some\ngood um audience inter another question\nfrom our audience uh Loren I think it's\nhow you say this Loren with a three um\nwant to know if you support sap Hannah\nas a source\nyes so I can take this so essentially uh\nwe are also working on several third\nparty sources as well and we are looking\nat some of the third party sources as\nwell uh I can't confirm yet but we are\nlooking at several key uh platforms\nwhich company uh people might be using\nso answer is stay tuned stay tuned watch\nthe space there's a lot more coming keep\nwatching AWS on air maybe they'll be\nback and have a fix me fix it for me\nbutton when\nI cool hey well is I want to make sure\nif there's anything else you guys want\nto show us if not like we can our\naudience go to learn more about zero ETL\nabout red shift and these features uh\nwhat what should they do next we have\ndedicated Pages uh on the AWS website\nand we also published several blogs this\nweek so both these Integrations went\nlive uh on 15th which is 3 days back so\nall of those resources would be\navailable to folks please check out and\ngive us all your Valu feedback\nespecially to Hawkeye Fiona and\nto yeah hey thanks for coming on the\nshow abav and shab and Fiona I'm\nimpressed with your ability to catch\nthose uh those red flags in you it's\nwhat I'm here for that's the only reason\nthey bring me on and she's she's cool as\na\ncucumber oh thank that's that's too\nnicey we'll see you thank\nyou all right so before we head into the\ncommercial break I do want want to give\na quick shout out for our survey today\nis going to be a very important day for\nthe survey for those of us who've been\ncoming along and watching AWS on air the\npast couple weeks you know that we're\ngoing to have our producer Nick doing\nsome pretty cooky stuff at um reinvent\nthis December which hopefully you're\ngonna be coming and joining us at um but\nin this survey you all get to vote what\nNick is going to have to do there are\nsome options in there what were the\noptions T I think one of them was a wing\neating contest one was a dance B\nmaybe something about him dressing up\nlike a pirate or him oh yeah there was\nthat one there was that one with buckets\nthe S3 mascot it could be it could get\nweird oh there it is that's the one\nthat's the one this is a new segment we\nhave on ad onir anytime we say Nick\npirate pirate here comes\nup respond first s respondents get $19\nin credits it is a really important\nthing we do appreciate the feedback we\nknowing uh what you think and what you\nthink we should be talking about what\nsegments what you like about the show\nwhat you don't like about the show um\nall really important stuff and we love\nmaking our producer Nick spend his\nweekends uh reading survey responses uh\nbetter to do so claim your $19 and get\nNick to do weird stuff at\nreinvent cool so uh what else we got for\nthe show F I think we've got our\nsponsored segment Nvidia has been\nsponsoring us all year our friend and\nawesome co- host Jasmine I think is\ngoing to be talking to I believe so yes\nI think she is today should we roll the\nsegment Jasmine it's all yours let's\nhand it over to\nher hey thanks for the intro hi guys\nwelcome to the show how are you hey\nJasmine I'm good how are you\nJ how's it going all is good I'm excited\nto talk with you today so la s tell me\nabout what it is that you're doing and\nwhat fun things we have today yes sure\nJasmine so thank you very much my name\nisri I work on the Nidia team and today\nwe are so excited to work with with sa\nand the sash maker team on bringing\nnames names names to customers so we\nwill discuss about names we will discuss\nabout the Nvidia software offerings and\nhow you can use it on\nS all right so Rob your turn we need to\nknow what Nims are so elu has already\ngiven us a little preview what's going\non yeah uh SAR Pi I'm product manager\nfor S maker entrance and I drive\npartnership with ilot and team here and\nexcited to discuss furthermore about\nsagemaker integration with Nims awesome\nso what is NVIDIA and Nims and you know\ntalk about how we're on sag maker what\nsets it apart yep absolutely Jasmine so\nNidia NS we have been working on\noptimizing inference so that's all we do\nis is making sure that not you you can\nget the best performance the best uh\nlatency the best throughput the best\naccuracy for your models running on AWS\nH maker on AWS GPU platforms so the way\nwe have been doing is making sure that\nthat the software plays an important\npart of the role it's not just the GPU\nit's how you combine the re the right\nGPU with the the right techniques and\nthe right libraries and the right\nsoftware and that is exactly what NES\ncome come into play uh but before that I\nwant to just show the screen if if you\nmay because either way uh we will help\nwe will be helping any Enterprise\ncustomer or any AI startup to make sure\nthey can get optimized they can get the\nbest performance wherever they are in\ntheir AI Journey so if they are using\noptimizing or INF or or gen War loads\nwill be helping across the entire\nJourney from data acquisition data\ncuration pre-training model\ncustomization information retrieval\ninference and GS so wherever you are in\nthe journey there is a tool from invia\nthat will be helping out of that\nperformance so for all of the steps for\nall of these steps there will be a piece\nof software including uh Nemo and\nincluding NES that are the one that we\nare going to talk about today so let's\ngo about NS Nims is a a container that\ninclude the state of the art performance\nso you bring your model could be llama\nor could be uh Nvidia biion Nemo or\ncould be any other model that you have\navailable so you bring this model and\nyou wonder yourself uh how you can run\nthe best performance the best inference\nfor that model so instead of going\ntechniques by techniques or or doing\nlike a pretty heavy job in terms of\nunderstanding what technique apply if\nit's bad size or or you know sparsity or\nlatency or accuracy whatever technique\nyou are you were trying to achieve you\njust bring the container with the state\nof the art you deploy it and it's like\nat wrong time so this is this is the\nstart the State ofth art for performance\nand we are excited to bring it to a s\nmaker so I want to just let SRA uh talk\nabout H how we can do it on on sagemaker\nwhy for sagemaker is important to run\nnames and then we can proceed with the\nwith the app sounds good thanks\niot and U yeah so Jasmine just for\ncontext right like sagemaker is AWS is\nfully managed capability for customers\nto build train and deploy machine\nlearning models I specifically focus on\ninfrance and within Insurance like we\nhave a suite of option that we give our\ncustomers to run their models ranging\nfor Real Time realtime Insurance\nasynchronous entrance and serous\nentrance uh so with Nims that OT just\nspoke about what our customers would be\nable to do is like kind of pick one of\nthe nyss that's being offered from\nNvidia and deployed on S maker in any of\nthese options uh to get the best price\nperformance when when when doing\ninference with with with\nJ nice so it's kind of you just pick it\nup and run it in Sag maker so we know\nthat that saves time and it creates\nefficiency but what strategies are used\nto monitor like performance and manage\ncosts in there is that built in as well\nyeah so we say maker inference we have\nsomething called as model monitoring\nright like so for any model that's\nrunning on sagemaker inference like\ncustomers would be able to kind of set\nup model monitoring jobs monit to the\nperformance of those models and kind of\nretrain the models if needed if they've\nkind of drifted and things like that\nright like so U with with Nims like what\nwhat customers get as Nvidia software\nfor uh deploying these models and and\nand with when they're running this on S\nmaker inference like we kind of optimize\nmultiple layers of stock right like we\ngive faster Auto scaling we give you\nprice performance by running multiple\nmodel on the same endpoint and then we\nhave a broad Suite of options uh in\nterms of the number of instances that\nyou can choose to deploy these models\nyeah nice I love hearing about all of\nthe features that are happening here as\nwell as the optimizations that customers\nget to make and they they kind of have\nthis you know at their fingertips but I\nwould love to see a demo yeah let's have\nuh am on who's going to drive the demo\nand Alo thanks for joining and uh um we\ncan probably bring up onone on stage\nthanks\nEl hey hey Jasmine welcome to the stage\nthank you thank you excited to be here\nlet me quickly introduce myself so I'm\nAlman I'm a specialist J essay on the\nmachine learning training and framework\nuh machine learning framework training\nand inflence team um yeah super I've\nbeen playing around with Nims for a\nwhile Sage maker on eks I super excited\nto show you all the demo let me quickly\nbring up my screen here\nawesome so um today I'm going to show\nyou how to deploy a envidia Nim for the\n405b model which is the the biggest\nllama model available right now so\nthat's a llama\n3.1 and um\nessentially um I'm going to run you\nthrough a a sage maker notebook that um\nand you can find this notebook on the\nawesome inference GitHub repository that\nwe have and that we maintain actively so\nyour first step essentially is to um\nhave an NGC CLI API key and the way you\ndo that like elth mentioned is you have\nan Enterprise account on NGC Hub and you\ncreate that NGC CLI API key and you pass\nit in to your notebook as an environment\nvariable and then once you do that you\ncan um set your IM am\npolicies so um at the bare minimum you\nneed uh all of the IM policies that are\nlisted here all of these pertain to uh\npulling the relevant images from ECR and\nI'll talk a little bit more about that\nin a second and then building those\nimages uh when you do do something like\nthis in production please keep the uh\nprinciple of lease privilege in mind uh\nespecially while def defining new um IM\nam policies and\nroles um now when it comes to setup um\nother than the roles You' need to\ninstall a few packages uh to be able to\nuse sagemaker appropriately first you\ninstall B of 3 and any other\ndependencies um so that you can set up\ncorrectly\nnow um in this notebook we walk you\nthrough how to uh set up the B three\nsession and client for uh so that you\ncan make the relevant python API calls\nuh and then also your user and role\nconfiguration along with region and then\nyour sagemaker session\nobviously and then um lastly for setup\nwe set these environment variables um\nand so this includes your CL API key\nlike I mentioned before but it also\nincludes the model name that you want to\npull from the um NGC\nHub uh and then also the sagemaker model\nname that you want to give so at a very\nhigh level um you would use something\ncalled sagemaker endpoints to deploy\nyour name onto your required hardware\nconfiguration now in this example we\ndeploy the like I said we deploy the\n405b Nim onto a single P5 48x large\ninstance um now remember sagemaker\nendpoints are fully managed so the\ninfrastructure site is fully taken care\nof as long as you specify it while\nconfiguring your deployment\nnow um your first step is to pull the\nimage from the ECR repo uh as you can\nsee on your screen right now we have um\na or we've defined a bash script that\nyou can run uh and all of this this bash\nscript all it does is it takes care of\nthe model pulling for\nyou and uh once the model image is\npulled you would then need to push it\nonto your own private ECR repository so\nthat it is referenceable from the rest\nof your notebook and from the rest of\nyour code now now uh one thing to note\nhere is to make sure that your image is\nnamed correctly you can check out\nnvidia's name page to check out um all\nof the supported names that are that\nNvidia is made available and\nadditionally you can also check um our\nECR repository for the ride\nnomenclature and of course you can print\nthe M image as well if you want to and\nthen the last step is to actually deploy\nyour sagemaker endpoint now in addition\nto um the Nim definition itself there's\na couple of things that you need to\nchange uh mainly because the 405b model\nis ginormous and it actually requires\nsome additional memory and additional\ntime to get loaded into\nmemory um so the first thing you change\nis the n timeout value again you don't\nneed to change this for any of the other\nmodels but since the 45b model takes\nsome extra time to get loaded into\nmemory um we can increase the um time\nout to 3600 seconds and then you can\nalso increase um the max\ntokens um which is number of output\ndoents yeah and then of course you can\nuse the sage maker. create model API\nCall to um actually create that model\nand then once that um model is created\nyou can then create your actual endpoint\nor you can go on to actually um\nconfiguring your endpoint and this is\nwhere you actually specify your\ndeployment parameters so specifically\nyou define your uh instance type the\nnumber of instances that you want to\ndeploy your model onto um and of course\nany other parameters like the sage maker\ntimeout so that you're not constrained\nby\ntimeouts uh We've like I said we've\nnoticed that the last two steps together\ntake around 40 minutes to run uh again\nthis is probably because of the size of\nthe model but one more thing I'd like to\ntalk about is how Nims is actually\nconfigur to run on your specific\nHardware so what happens behind the\nscenes is there's something called\nsweeps that that get run and depending\non your Hardware nyss chooses which\nconfiguration to run and configuration\nis just a in my opinion a very fancy\nterm for um flags that you pass into\ntens llm uh since tens llm is the back\nend that's running for\nNS so NS automatically chooses the most\num efficient and the most optimized um\nimage to run in the back end for\nyou and then um once complete you can\nsee uh two things first you see that the\nsagemaker model is created and second\nyou see the uh sagemaker endpoint is\ncreated uh\num also here uh that once the endpoint\nis ready right like the infrastructure\nbehind the endpoint is fully managed by\nsagemaker and then the model itself the\nmodel weights as well as the model\ncontainer is something that that you get\nfrom Nims already optimized spedia so\nwith this like to run the model like\ncustomers would get the kind of the best\nprice performance on the infrastructure\nside coming from sag maker and then an\noptimal uh performance coming from from\nNvidia uh because these nms are already\noptimized for a given\nmodel yeah and um to that point let me\njust quickly show you the model that's\ncreated and also if if you go to your\nSage maker console you can see the model\nwhich I just showed and you can also see\nthe um endpoint configuration that's\ncreated yeah so that means that\ncustomers are getting to deploy the\nstate-of-the-art llms in minutes and not\njust not days right it doesn't take days\nto get something spun up\nexactly so like like I said the 405\nmodel takes around 40 minutes and um\nthat includes choosing the best\nconfiguration for you as well that's\njust for the the infrastructure to get\nset up right like but Jasmine customers\ndo save time in terms of the you know\ntrying to figure out things trying to\nfigure out where the model is which is\nthe best\nparameter where like setting up the\ninfrastructure right like on in terms of\nhow do you club together a bunch of ec2\ncreate a service that's able to host a\nmodel\nuh so so customers won't have to do that\nit's just like few few steps that they\nneed to follow and they'll get an\ninference end point to to get running\nwith it nice and as we're moving through\nthis demo here what are the types of\ncustomers that are using this for like\nwhat are they\nbuilding yeah so um like Nims is kind of\na broad Suite of options in terms of the\nuh the models that they've curated right\nuh they have models from ranging from\nllama to some of the biotech models to\nsome of the Dr Discovery models so yeah\nI mean we've seen like customer interest\nacross like all the spectrum that uh\nthat of of Nims that Nvidia offers and\nuh as as am on is sharing like we have\nuh an ECR repository where Nvidia is\nkind of putting the containers uh for\nAWS customers to quickly use that ECR\nrepository to deploy the models on\nsagemaker with with keys from uh NGC oh\nnice so a variety of you cases are\nalready supported and there's some\ndocumentation in there if you need to\nget a project idea of oh can I do this\nand someone might have already started\non it yeah so we have like a launch blog\nand and a and a technical blog that\nwe've kind of published about how this\ncan work into to end for for customers\nwho are already familiar with sagemaker\nor not familiar with sagemaker as well\nas the same goes with lims uh you can\njust follow along the blog step by step\nand it also has the notebook that that\nAman is mentioning here and you can uh\nyeah you know kind of pick any of the\nNIMS that's offered and and deployed on\nsagemaker okay awesome on anything to\nleave us with we're gonna come back and\ncome to a close here yeah and I just\nwanted to say the beauty of Nims and by\nby extension that these notebooks is\nthat you all you need to do is\nessentially just change the uh model\nname that you import or the image name\nthat you pull and um the infrastructure\nthat you want to run on and you should\nbe able to run all of these out of the\nbox sizes nice I really like that being\nable to give customers something out of\nthe box and say hey keep going awesome\nall right thanks Aman that was great\nsounds good thanks we'll have El youth\ncome\nback yeah thank you everyone uh just a\nclose call to option is uh let's make\nsure that you can use names on sagemaker\nthat they can uh get to m.com and and\nuse it there or come to sagemaker and\nuse NES uh we'll be happy to help and\nwe'll face uh the the the blogs and the\ndocumentation on this integration in the\nchat yeah they'll be here in the chat\nand then let us know if you have more\nquestions for Invidia along the way um\nEllie youth I heard that you're in the\nAWS Marketplace for the Nvidia AI\nEnterprise so that's one of my favorite\nplaces to send customers so we'll have\nthose links all up for you and where to\ngo next to get started so Rob Aman Leu\nthank you this has been so fun I learned\na lot um let's see how we're using\nNvidia Nims on sag maker\nsounds good thanks thanks Jessman\nthanks all right welcome back Todd\nwelcome back to the show so that's\nNvidia ons hey if you're just joining us\nI see some people some new folks in the\nchat some new names uh this is AWS on\nair we are a live stream every Friday\nwhere we go over the latest and greatest\nthings that are happening at AWS brought\nto you by the people who help to develop\nthem so we do demos and we do different\nconversations we kind of showcase what's\nnew here at AWS so thanks for tuning in\nuh Fiona I think Nick needs to get those\ncelery sticks ready it looks like he's\ngonna be eating some hot wings at\nreinvent this year is what it does seems\nso I know we had some people that were\nyou know reviewing or going through the\nsurvey and coming up with what he's\ngoing to have to do at reinvent it looks\nlike uh a hotwing competition might be\nin the lead right now so if you're\nfeeling like you're Pro song I know we\nhad a couple people here in the chat\nthat wanted him to be singing some song\nlyrics and you if you haven't\nparticipated in the survey yet make sure\nto go fill it out that would make my\nreinvent to see Nick sing Katy Perry\nreinvent I would like that I would like\nthat very much but hey uh thanks for\nfilling out the survey uh we've got a\nfew folks that have already responded to\nthe survey so we appreciate that uh if\nyou haven't yet please do go to uh the\nsurvey first 10 response get $19 in AWS\ncredits let us know what you think about\nthe show there's an opportunity to vote\nfor what our producer Nick will have to\ndo at reinvent here coming\nup uh let's see what else do we got on\nthe show here today F I mean I think\nthat we may have the honor of Jeff bar\njoining us to talk about some other\nupcoming announcements for AWS do you\nthink we should bring him on yeah\nspeaking of yeah this is the cream of\nthe crop the creme de creme as they call\nit the person who knows the most about\nwhat's new at AWS has been doing it for\na long time I'm always I always learn\nsomething new from Jeff uh whether or\nnot it's through Linkedin and his uh his\nuh bites uh on AWS but yeah let's do it\nlet's bring him in let's bring\nhim hey Fiona hey Todd hey Jeff welcome\nto the show how you doing good let me\njust mute my phone here\nokay pador things are good I'm here in a\nbeautiful vashan island just outside\nSeattle and uh it's a little little\ncloudy but still wonderful day got lots\nof day in front of me so still I was\ngoing to say is it raining what's a fun\nfact about what do vason Island where\nwhere where is this is just outside of\nSeattle it's just a tiny bit um west of\nSeattle it's a 20 minute ride on on what\nwe call the water taxi from the Seattle\nwaterfront to the island and uh when\npeople hear water taxi they kind of\nthink um some little like little robot\nbut it's actually it holds a couple\nhundred people so it's not like tiny\nlittle how many people live on Bashan\nIsland it's about\n10,000 um about 10,000 I'm one of the\nyounger ones believe it or not\nso all those fruits and vegetables that\nthat keep you looking young J yeah not\nquite a senior citizen's home but it's\nit's got kind of got an aging population\nso eating a spinach he's staying strong\nbut a really cool place and not not\nsuper welln one of the most awesome\nthings actually is if you time the ride\nleaving Seattle just right you can show\nup just as little tiny bit after sunrise\nand you get the most beautiful view of\nthe city it's like absolutely great way\nto start the day did you say after\nSunrise that's early oh yeah well what\ntime do you wake up in the morning\nJeff uh off in five\nsomething yeah I'm right I'm sound\nasleep at that time it's kind of a curse\nI I I've often found myself up Ear that\nearly in the morning uh and it's a great\ntime to get work done really no nobody's\nmaking nobody's pinging on slack\nnobody's uh asking for the status of\nwhatever uh you just focus and guess at\nleast for me that's how I get most of my\nstuff done yeah exactly so what what do\nyou what do you got for us this week\nJeff we got what's a new at AWS what are\nsome of your top I've got a couple\nreally cool things and what I like about\nall these is these actually all build on\non services and features that we already\nhave um the first one is called the\nconversational builders for Bedrock\nagents so this is kind kind of kind of\nNE there's there's a lot of moving Parts\nhere so let's take it apart uh kind of\npiece by piece so we we've talked about\nBedrock a bunch right it gives our our\ncustomers access to a whole bunch of\ndifferent Foundation models um it's\nfully managed service helps our\ncustomers to build gen apps that are\nsecure and private and scalable and\nresponsible um not new we launched it\nlast year and we've added a ton of\nfoundation models to it since then and\ncontinue to do so um but also not new is\nsomething called the Bedrock agents so\nthe Bedrock agents basically are they\nthey kind of sit between the foundation\nmodel and the outside world and\nbasically kind of mediate interaction\nbetween the foundation model and data\nsources and applications and user\nconversations and so forth and the cool\nthing about these agents is they can\nactually give extra power to the model\nand to the Gen apps in in a way because\nyou can automate tasks you can use them\nto answer specific questions they can\nlike ask the user from extra information\nto complete the the task but they can\nalso do things like making API calls to\nyour company systems they can call\nLambda functions they can help to\ndecompose big requests into smaller\npieces the agents are super super\npowerful um and you can even attach them\nto knowledge bases so so this is not new\neither so we got two big we got Bedrock\nthe foundation models the agents none of\nthis is new but what what is cool is we\nlaunched this really cool thing called a\nconversation Builder that is uh it's\nkind of like AI for AI in a sense um we\nshouldn't call that gen gen AI probably\nnot would be kind of\nawful yeah it but it's kind of AI for AI\nso you you basically get this\ninteractive assistant where you you chat\nwith the assistant and it helps you to\nbuild the agents so you can you can like\nset up the name in the description you\ncan get a summary of what the agent can\ndo um you can manage the knowledge base\nand the cool thing is you can even just\nask this conversational agent to\nliterally create for you an agent so let\nme let me just pull up a another screen\nhere for a sec um so I I follow one of\nthe examples and I L I opened up the the\nagent console and I said build a travel\nbooking agent for business travel in my\ncompany and it thought for a little bit\nand behind the scenes it uses Claude\nSonet um and so it creates a little\nagent you can then flip into test mode\nand in addition to be being it it\nbecause it's it's mostly like a\nprogrammatic agent that's kind of\nsitting there doing stuff but you can\nactually interact with it which is kind\nof cool so I asked the agent I asked it\nwhat can you do and it came up with this\ncool thing it said hello as a travel\nbooking agent I'm here to assist you\nwith arranging business travel plans for\nemployees and it shows me what what it\ncan help me with so so this agent is\nessentially giving extra power to the\nfoundation model and to the apps that\nare built with the foundation model so\nthe generic Foundation model doesn't\nunderstand how to do business travel but\nby using this agent it\ncan understand how to do this so so\nthere there's actually a prompt that\ngets added in behind the scenes So when\nyou say build me a particular agent it's\nactually making a a very detailed very\nspecific specialized kind of a prompt um\nthere there's a lot of indirection here\nthat we're we're kind of talking through\nto make this happen but but I think it's\nsuper super\ncool so that's the first neat\nthing bedrock and then there's the agent\nthat is doing a task onto bedrock and\nthen this conversational agent is a\nagent on top of that agent that tells\nyou what that agent can do exactly okay\nthis is the old thing about solving any\nproblem in computer science with another\nlevel of indirection and this this is\nexactly what's going on there of things\nthat talk to things and agents that help\nyou to build agents and then talking to\nthe agent about what it can do and it\nit's it's it's really cool there's some\ngreat docks and there's there's actually\na lot of good um samples and some good\nblog post as well to explain what I've\ndescribed as the next kind of thing in\nthe generative AI space this agent based\ngenerative Ai and so there's going to be\nagents that do different things so I\nthink it's gonna it's GNA be a really\nimportant feature uh as we move but this\nis also where the AI crawls out of the\ncomputer and can can then do stuff in\nthe real world so like when when the AI\ndecides to like take over the world and\nlike unplug all of\nthe security system I've been waiting\nthat fure we're talking agents like you\nmean agent like agent Smith from the\nMatrix right like this is the precursor\nto agent Smith if you have the right\nHardware\nyeah if you have a robot right so so so\nin theory actually like you could have a\nLambda function that does some iot stuff\nand controls a robot somewhere so the\nagent could could like go out and do\nsomething I guess if we do have that\nyou're gonna hear about it first here on\nAWS yeah that' be an awesome demo\nwouldn't it that be cool demo yeah work\nfor that\nanyway let's see other cool thing um\nthis one next one is much more\npedestrian so we we've got Amazon\nelastic file system or or EFS which\nwe've had for a long time um I I like\nEFS because it's super super simple you\ncreate the file system you mount it to\nyour Linux or your your windows instance\nand then you've got this infinitely\nscalable file system you just keep\nthrowing files at it it's just going to\nscale up to give you just as much um\nstorage as you want and in addition to\nmounting it to instances you can mount\nit to Lambda functions and actually you\ncan also mount it to your on premises um\ncompute power so you can have this\nscalable elastic file system in the\ncloud that that can be shared across\nboth your your Cloud compute and your\nserverless compute and your on- premises\ncompute if you'd like so so that's CFS\nthat's that's not new I I wrote about\nthat a long time ago but what's really\ncool is we actually boosted the amount\nof read through put you can get you can\nnow get up to 60 gigabytes per second of\nread through put from EFS file systems\nwhich is\na huge amount it's probably a lot more\nthan any customer needs right now I I\nmight think but the to me the cool thing\nabout these gigantic limits is when\nyou're designing some system you're kind\nof thinking to the way out into the\nfuture where you're think I want to have\ngazillions of users and I want to be the\nmost successful service anywhere in the\nworld you've got all that scale and all\nthat Headroom so that you don't have to\nthink okay if I do get successful I'm\ngoing to hit some some scaling limit so\nso being able to get up to this 60\ngigabytes per second is like wow a ton\nof awesome read throughput you know off\nthe top of your head what the throughput\nwas previously the um it was actually\nhalf of that it was it was 30 gigabytes\nper second sheesh okay big Improvement\nso so there there's a there is a little\nbit of a footnote on this um we we it's\navailable in seven regions where you can\nget up to the to 60 in there but there's\nthere's another set of regions where the\nlimit used to be three and we've moved\nthat one up to 10 so so it is kind of\nscaling um in different regions at\ndifferent points I I have to guess\nthat's kind of based on the the growth\nof our customers and the use cases in\nthose different regions is is how the\nteam decides when they need to push\nthose numbers up and do whatever magic\nthey have to do to make it support more\nthroughput but but it's there it's cool\num we'll we'll drop a link to the what's\nnew in that very cool and the other one\ndo we have time for one more one more\nyeah let's do it one more okay so um ec2\ndedicated hosts these have been around\nfor a long time I think I wrote about\nthem in 2015 so like nine plus years ago\nat this point so dedicated hosts are\nbasically physical servers that are as\nthe name says they're dedicated for\ncustomer use and the idea of these is\nit's really good for licensed software\nwe're kind of old school licensed\nsoftware like often database engines and\nservers you're to stay within the\nlicense you have to actually run it on\nsome physical piece of Hardware that's\ndevot to that that database server and\nyou're you can't move it from place to\nplace willy-nilly like just by like\nchanging instances so so and and also\ndifferent kinds of compliance make make\nthese uh make the dedicated host super\nsuper cool so there there's two levels\nof use when you do a dedicated host so\nthe the dedicated host is basically like\nthe the physical piece of hardware and\nfor most ec2 instance sizes the\ndedicated host is got enough capacity\nthat you run a bunch of instances on\nthat individual host so what you do is\nyou you launch the host and then you\nlaunch instances within that host so you\nmight like allocate one host and run\ndepending on the size of the host and\ninstances you might run six eight 10 12\ndifferent uh instances on there so\nyou've got all those on there and so\nnone of this is new this has all been\naround for for quite some time but what\nwe have now that's I think really a good\naddition to our for our customers is\nautomatic live migration so so the host\nis real Hardware real Hardware wears out\nbut breaks and explodes and leaks all\nthat kind of stuff sometimes at the\npoint where we start to to detect behind\nthe scenes that things are starting to\nto fail in that Hardware we'll do an\nautomatic transparent live migration off\nto a fresh piece of Hardware the\ninstances stay running the customer\ndoesn't know anything has\nhappened so it it is a physical piece of\nHardware but if if things start to go\nwrong with that physical piece of\nHardware we'll just push it off to\nanother physical piece of Hardware\nthat's also dedicated it just happens to\nbe a different kind of long-term piece\nof Hardware so um totally transparent no\nstopping no rebooting I don't even think\nthere's like an indication that it\nhappened it just magically keeps your\nHardware running for you behind the\nscenes which I I think is pretty cool\nthat's\nincredible that happens uh this is the\nthe huge value of managed service right\nlike imagine having to do that yourself\nlike anticipate the degradation of some\nhardware and then switch it without\nlosing availability doing it live like\nfirst having metrics inside to know that\nit's going wrong and then and then\nsaying oh this is a problem and thinking\noh do we have any spares of this\nparticular one or not and then so so\nwhat's running on it there there's a lot\nof interesting challenges just happen\nmagically and for free really that I\nit's one of those things that is so cool\nabout the cloud and AWS is a lot of\nstuff that like in the generations past\nwe had to worry wor about is now it just\nit just does it for you and not only\ndoes it do it for you it does it with\nwith systems that have been tested at\nscale a bunch of times like back well\ndecades ago at this point I I used to\nlike run MySQL on my own hardware and\nlike you run it on one server you think\nyou know I I better actually make sure I\ncan fail over to a different piece of\nHardware if it breaks actually scripting\nand testing that failover there there's\nalways another way it can fail that you\ndon't know about Until It Breaks that\nyou didn't detect and but the scale we\ndo things we know that we know all those\nfailure modes way ahead of any customer\nand no super helpful red box that says\nfix this for me is gonna pop up I missed\nthe red box yeah so is the migration is\nit um going to be enabled by default or\nis it something that customers opt into\num this this happens automatically and\nbe by default now there is a list of\ninstance types it works with it's a long\nbut is a specific list of of general\npurpose and compute and memory optimized\ninstances I I think we have to actually\ntest very specifically on every instance\ntype there's probably Hardware nuances\nthat make this as as seamless as it\nimagine I imagine that list will grow\nover time as we work out they always do\nyeah yeah well very cool but they grow\nthey grow over time partly in response\nto customers coming to us and saying you\nknow I I want to run a dedicated host of\nthis particular type make sure you have\nthat on on your your backlog and so it\nis it is is a little bit on our\ncustomers to make sure that their needs\nare expressed to us in some\nway yeah and that's the that's why we\nsolicit for surveys and feedback because\nwe want to do what's going to be most\nhelpful for the people using it for sure\nyeah so so apparently I'm Nick is being\nvoted to do wings at reinvent and I I\nhereby volunteer to eat wings with Nick\nat reinvent so yeah that's why I was\ntelling Nick get your celery ready it's\ngonna get it's gonna get hot at reinvent\nthis so speaking of Nick should we uh\nshould we bring on our our producer and\ntalk to sure we should yeah you know I\nthink Jeff that is a legally\ncontractually set thing now we set it on\nair got an audience of a couple thousand\nhere Jeff bar and I having a hotwing\neating cont I would never turn down hot\nwings perfect also I'm really glad I\njust need to point this out for the\nfirst time ever folks everybody on the\non air team is wearing the same colored\nshirt so it looks very coordinated today\ntody kind of ruins the by having some\ngraphics on it but we'll roll with it\nhey this is my replay shirt from last\nyear's reinvent I'm trying to get in the\nmindset this year I'm ready for for\nreinvent we'll allow it then we'll allow\nit but yeah guys guys take the survey\nlet first off I need something to read\ntonight I'm a lonely person I get you\nknow my social interaction from reading\npeople's surveys plus let's be honest\nwho doesn't love taking a multiple\nchoice test I know I did and I was the\ncool kid in school clearly so get your\nmultiple choice kick hearken back to the\ndays of taking the SATs and standardized\ntesting in grade school good old days\nwant to take a survey think that's\nG doing the opposite yeah right now the\ntwo leading ones are almost tied is me\nhaving to do this hot we eting contest\nwith Jeff and me having to work song\nlyrics into every single uh interview\nthat I do a roaming segment so well let\nus know what you want let's do those\nwings regardless of of popular opinion\nyeah let's be honest we're definitely\ndoing the hot wing let's just do those I\nwant some I want some free hot wings\nyeah guys let us know with the comments\ntoday the AWS as a service that's great\nI mean I think that would sell that'd be\nour best seller if I could have a\nmanaged chicken wing production at home\njust put the chicken wings in front of\nme and the the rule Jeff the first one\nto show any sort of pain during the hot\nwings loses I think that's is a pepper a\nfruit or a vegetable\nthough I knower a pepper's a wasn't like\na fruit the fruit is the seed and a\nvegetable houses the seeds or something\noh you got a better education than I did\nsomething like that I'm gonna guess\nvegetabl according to our datab it's a\nberry all right I didn't know\nthat but yeah guys and the other thing\nis we'll drop a link to get registered\nfor reinvent in the chat here uh\ndefinitely encourage everybody to do so\nbesides getting to watch Jeff and I eat\noutrageously hot foods uh you can also\nstop by our booth we'll have some cool\nswag there maybe you can say hi to us\nwalking by say hi to your mom on camera\nwho doesn't love that uh there are so\nmany cool things at uh on the Expo floor\nthat you can do a lot of the demos uh\nthat we come up with like you can\nactually live interact with them last\nyear I was able to fly a drone I used\nthe F1 race simulator which was pretty\nsweet got to do an NFL passing thing\nwhich was kind of cool I even played\nbeer pong against a robot so lots of\ncool things to do at reinvent uh\neverybody should definitely come check\nit out and if you're wondering where we\nare just look for the mass crowd\ngathering with people crying tears of\njoy and you'll probably see the on\npeople come all the way to Vegas just to\nsee us in person they do actually\nbasically it's like uh the magician\nwhat's it the Chris Angel and then it's\nlike us we're like we right there just\nabout on some scale he's the Mind Freak\nwe're the cloud freak you know it's just\nhand in Tina's reminding you can also\nget a tattoo I learned this last year I\nwas at reinvent saw people getting\ntattoos at a at reinvent which is\nincredible I was told I'm not allowed\ndoes it have to be a logo I was totally\nready I was down I was committing I was\ngonna get a Amazon smiley face like on\nmy neck or something but uh they said it\nwasn't it was for customers\nonly I'm sure your wife was probably\nappreciative of that Ro\nall right guys well I know we're at time\nso we got to wrap here uh but yeah\neverybody take survey register for\nreinvent let us know your thoughts on\nthe show and uh who's gonna take us out\ntoday I think it's Todd's\nturn sure what am I doing gotta take us\nout man what's the CL hey I'll take us\nout uh you want me to sing a song or\nsomething oh yes well\nnow absolutely we want you to sing a\nsong Hey I'm gonna see you at reinvent I\nwill be there I'm super excited thanks\nfor watching Everybody we'll see you\nnext week uh on AWS on\nair see you all\n",
