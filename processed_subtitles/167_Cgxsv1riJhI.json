  "text": "Ten years ago,\ncomputer vision researchers\nthought that getting a computer\nto tell the difference\nbetween a cat and a dog\nwould be almost impossible,\neven with the significant advance\nin the state of artificial intelligence.\nNow we can do it at a level\ngreater than 99 percent accuracy.\nThis is called image classification --\ngive it an image,\nput a label to that image --\nand computers know\nthousands of other categories as well.\nI'm a graduate student\nat the University of Washington,\nand I work on a project called Darknet,\nwhich is a neural network framework\nfor training and testing\ncomputer vision models.\nSo let's just see what Darknet thinks\nof this image that we have.\nWhen we run our classifier\non this image,\nwe see we don't just get\na prediction of dog or cat,\nwe actually get\nspecific breed predictions.\nThat's the level\nof granularity we have now.\nAnd it's correct.\nMy dog is in fact a malamute.\nSo we've made amazing strides\nin image classification,\nbut what happens\nwhen we run our classifier\non an image that looks like this?\nWell ...\nWe see that the classifier comes back\nwith a pretty similar prediction.\nAnd it's correct,\nthere is a malamute in the image,\nbut just given this label,\nwe don't actually know that much\nabout what's going on in the image.\nWe need something more powerful.\nI work on a problem\ncalled object detection,\nwhere we look at an image\nand try to find all of the objects,\nput bounding boxes around them\nand say what those objects are.\nSo here's what happens\nwhen we run a detector on this image.\nNow, with this kind of result,\nwe can do a lot more\nwith our computer vision algorithms.\nWe see that it knows\nthat there's a cat and a dog.\nIt knows their relative locations,\ntheir size.\nIt may even know some extra information.\nThere's a book sitting in the background.\nAnd if you want to build a system\non top of computer vision,\nsay a self-driving vehicle\nor a robotic system,\nthis is the kind\nof information that you want.\nYou want something so that\nyou can interact with the physical world.\nNow, when I started working\non object detection,\nit took 20 seconds\nto process a single image.\nAnd to get a feel for why\nspeed is so important in this domain,\nhere's an example of an object detector\nthat takes two seconds\nto process an image.\nSo this is 10 times faster\nthan the 20-seconds-per-image detector,\nand you can see that by the time\nit makes predictions,\nthe entire state of the world has changed,\nand this wouldn't be very useful\nfor an application.\nIf we speed this up\nby another factor of 10,\nthis is a detector running\nat five frames per second.\nThis is a lot better,\nbut for example,\nif there's any significant movement,\nI wouldn't want a system\nlike this driving my car.\nThis is our detection system\nrunning in real time on my laptop.\nSo it smoothly tracks me\nas I move around the frame,\nand it's robust to a wide variety\nof changes in size,\npose,\nforward, backward.\nThis is great.\nThis is what we really need\nif we're going to build systems\non top of computer vision.\n(Applause)\nSo in just a few years,\nwe've gone from 20 seconds per image\nto 20 milliseconds per image,\na thousand times faster.\nHow did we get there?\nWell, in the past,\nobject detection systems\nwould take an image like this\nand split it into a bunch of regions\nand then run a classifier\non each of these regions,\nand high scores for that classifier\nwould be considered\ndetections in the image.\nBut this involved running a classifier\nthousands of times over an image,\nthousands of neural network evaluations\nto produce detection.\nInstead, we trained a single network\nto do all of detection for us.\nIt produces all of the bounding boxes\nand class probabilities simultaneously.\nWith our system, instead of looking\nat an image thousands of times\nto produce detection,\nyou only look once,\nand that's why we call it\nthe YOLO method of object detection.\nSo with this speed,\nwe're not just limited to images;\nwe can process video in real time.\nAnd now, instead of just seeing\nthat cat and dog,\nwe can see them move around\nand interact with each other.\nThis is a detector that we trained\non 80 different classes\nin Microsoft's COCO dataset.\nIt has all sorts of things\nlike spoon and fork, bowl,\ncommon objects like that.\nIt has a variety of more exotic things:\nanimals, cars, zebras, giraffes.\nAnd now we're going to do something fun.\nWe're just going to go\nout into the audience\nand see what kind of things we can detect.\nDoes anyone want a stuffed animal?\nThere are some teddy bears out there.\nAnd we can turn down\nour threshold for detection a little bit,\nso we can find more of you guys\nout in the audience.\nLet's see if we can get these stop signs.\nWe find some backpacks.\nLet's just zoom in a little bit.\nAnd this is great.\nAnd all of the processing\nis happening in real time\non the laptop.\nAnd it's important to remember\nthat this is a general purpose\nobject detection system,\nso we can train this for any image domain.\nThe same code that we use\nto find stop signs or pedestrians,\nbicycles in a self-driving vehicle,\ncan be used to find cancer cells\nin a tissue biopsy.\nAnd there are researchers around the globe\nalready using this technology\nfor advances in things\nlike medicine, robotics.\nThis morning, I read a paper\nwhere they were taking a census\nof animals in Nairobi National Park\nwith YOLO as part\nof this detection system.\nAnd that's because Darknet is open source\nand in the public domain,\nfree for anyone to use.\n(Applause)\nBut we wanted to make detection\neven more accessible and usable,\nso through a combination\nof model optimization,\nnetwork binarization and approximation,\nwe actually have object detection\nrunning on a phone.\n(Applause)\nAnd I'm really excited because\nnow we have a pretty powerful solution\nto this low-level computer vision problem,\nand anyone can take it\nand build something with it.\nSo now the rest is up to all of you\nand people around the world\nwith access to this software,\nand I can't wait to see what people\nwill build with this technology.\nThank you.\n(Applause)\n",
