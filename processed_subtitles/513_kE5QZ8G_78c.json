  "text": "hi guys this is apeksha from simply\nlearn and today we are going to talk\nabout the two types of machine learning\nsupervised and unsupervised learning\ntheir types and applications but before\nwe talk about them let's quickly\nunderstand what is machine learning\nthese days applications use artificial\nintelligence and machine learning to\noptimize speech recognition i usually\nask siri things i want to know like hey\nsiri how far is the nearest subway so\nwhenever we ask something to siri a\npowerful speech recognition kicks off\nand converts the audio into its\ncorresponding textual form which is then\nsent to the apple servers for further\nprocessing then neural language\nprocessing algorithms are run to\nunderstand the user's intent and then\nfinally siri tells you the answer well\nthis is what machine learning is all\nabout making the machines learn and act\nlike humans by feeding them with data\nand information without being explicitly\nprogrammed as we saw in the previous\nexample when the data comes in machines\nimmediately starts analyzing the data\nand eventually gets trained on it and\nlearns it now when a new data point\ncomes in machine accurately makes\nprediction and decisions based on the\npast data now that you know what is\nmachine learning let's talk about\nsupervised and unsupervised learning\nsupervised learning as the name suggests\nworks under supervision that is it's\nlearning in which machine is trained\nwith data which is well labeled and then\npredicts with the help of the label data\nset but what is a label data set data\nfor which you already know the target\nanswer is called a label data like i\nshow you an image and tell you that it's\na dog then it's a label data while if i\nshow you an image without telling you\nwhat exactly it is then it's an\nunlabeled data now let's say we have\nimages which are labeled as spoon or\nknife we then feed it to the machine\nwhich analyzes and learns the\nassociation of these images with its\nlabels based on its features such as\nshape size sharpness etc now when a new\nimage is fed to the machine without any\nlabel with the help of the past data the\nmachine is able to predict accurately\nand tell that it's a spoon hence in\nsupervised machine learning the\nalgorithm teaches the model to learn\nfrom the labeled example that we provide\nso supervised learning can be further\ndivided into classification and\nregression it is a classification\nproblem when the output variable is\ncategoric such as red or blue disease or\nno disease male or female whereas it's a\nregression problem when the output\nvariable is a real or continuous value\nfor example salary based on work\nexperience weight based on height so it\ncreates a predictive model showing\ntrends and data so now if i say will i\nget a salary raise or not that's\nclassification but if i say how much\nsalary raise will i get that is\nregression now let's understand\nclassification with the help of an\nexample in order to predict whether an\nemail is a spam or not first we need to\nteach our machine what a spam mail looks\nlike this is done based on a lot of spam\nfilters like firstly reviewing the\ncontent of the email then review the\nemail header and search if it contains\nany falsified information this is done\nbased on some keywords like free\nlottery\nprice claim etc then general blacklist\nfilters to stop emails that come from\nalready blacklisted known spammers and\netc so all these filters scores the\nemail which is known as spam score the\nlower the total spam score of the email\nit is more likely that the email will\nland in subscribers in boxes so based on\nthe content labels and spam score of the\nnew incoming mail the algorithm decides\nwhether it should land in inbox or the\nspam folder\nnow let's quickly understand regression\nso let's say we have two variables that\nis temperature and humidity where\ntemperature is the independent variable\nand humidity is the dependent variable\nsuch that as the temperature increases\nhumidity decreases hence they are\ncorrelated when we feed this data to a\nregression model it will understand the\nrelationship between these two variables\nand how one variable depends on the\nother after the machine is trained it\ncan easily predict the humidity based on\nthe given temperature\nwell that was about regression now let's\nsee some real life applications where\nsupervised learning is used so\nsupervised learning is used in risk\nassessment to assess risk in financial\nservices or an insurance domain to\nminimize the risk portfolio of the\ncompanies image classification facebook\nrecognizes your friend in a picture from\nan album of tagged photos so image\nclassification is one of the key use\ncases of demonstrating supervised\nmachine learning algorithms obviously a\nlot more goes into all these like\nconvolutional neural networks etc fraud\ndetection whether the transactions made\nby the user are authentic or not and\nvisual recognition the ability of a\nmachine learning model to identify\nobjects places people and actions and\nimages now let's quickly talk about\nunsupervised learning in unsupervised\nlearning there is no supervision that is\nno training will be given to the machine\nallowing it to act on the data which is\nnot labeled hence machine tries to\nidentify patterns and gives the response\nlet's take a similar example as before\nbut this time we do not tell the machine\nwhether it's a spoon or a knife the\nmachine identifies patterns from the\ngiven set and groups them based on their\npatterns similarities etc again\nunsupervised learning can be further\ngrouped into clustering and association\nclustering is basically where the\nmachine forms groups based on the\nbehavior of the data secondly\nassociation it is a rule-based machine\nlearning to discover interesting\nrelation between variables in large data\nsets for example which customer made\nsimilar product purchases is clustering\nwhereas association is which products\nwere purchased together now let's\nunderstand clustering with the help of\nan example to reduce their churn rate a\ntelecom company studies the behavior of\nthe customers based on average call\nduration and internet usage and observes\nthat while some customers call duration\nis quite high others have heavy internet\nusage the customers are grouped based on\ntheir observed behavior and a strategy\nis adopted to minimize churn rate and\nmaximize profit via suitable promotions\nand campaigns\nas you can see in the chart on the right\nhand side customers in group a uses more\ndata and also have high quality group b\ncustomers are heavy internet users while\ngroup c customers have high call\nduration so group b will be given more\ndata benefit plans while group c will be\ngiven cheaper call rates to buy their\nloyalty so this was the example of\nclustering now let's understand\nassociation with another example let's\nsay customer one goes to a supermarket\nand buys these products say bread milk\nfruits wheat then customer 2 goes and\nbuys bread milk rice and butter\nnow when customer 3 goes and buys bread\nit is highly likely that he will also\nbuy milk hence relationship is\nestablished based on customer behavior\nand recommendations are made now let's\nlook at some real-life applications of\nunsupervised learning market basket\nanalysis is a machine learning model\nbased on the algorithm that if you buy a\ncertain group of items you are less more\nlikely to buy another group of items\nsemantic clustering semantically similar\nwords share similar context people post\ntheir queries on websites in their own\nways semantic clustering groups all\nresponses in a cluster with same meaning\nto ensure that the customer finds the\ninformation they want quickly and easily\nit plays an important role in\ninformation retrieval good browsing\nexperience and comprehension delivery\nstore optimization machine learning\nmodels are used to predict the demand\nand keep up with the supply also to open\nstores where demand is more and\noptimizing routes for more efficient\ndeliveries according to past data and\nbehavior we can also use unsupervised\nmachine learning models to identify\naccident prone areas based on the\nintensity of those accidents and the\narea in order to introduce safety\nmeasures by now i hope you've understood\nsupervised and unsupervised learning for\na quick recap let's see a few\ndifferences between the two the most\nfundamental difference is that\nsupervised learning uses known and\nlabeled data and unsupervised learning\nuses unlabeled data as their input\nsecondly supervised learning follows a\nfeedback mechanism while unsupervised\nlearning does not also the most commonly\nused algorithms in supervised learning\nare decision tree logistic regression\nsupport vector machine etc and at\nunsupervised learning their k-means\nclustering hierarchical clustering a\npriori algorithm and many more so that's\nall for supervised and supervised\nlearning keep
