  "text": "[Music]\nhello everybody I'm glad to see all my\nfavorite viewers I'm Paul the biggest\ncrypto blogger on YouTube as always\ntoday we are delving into the C topic of\ncrypto arbitrage strategy from the title\nof this video you already understand\nthat we will be discussing Litecoin\nArbitrage but remember that Arbitrage is\nnot just about storing coins in your\nwallet it's about maximizing your\nprofits right here and now let me show\nyou how it works the price of Litecoin\nchanges every second so it makes no\nsense to name a specific figure Because\nby the time you watch this video it will\nmost likely change this provides a\nfantastic opportunity to benefit from my\ncrypto arbitrage strategy which involves\ntrading between two exchanges to make a\nprofit I'll walk you through a\nstep-by-step process that anyone can\nfollow and repeat the basic idea is\nsimple we buy Litecoin on one exchange\nat a lower price and sell it on another\nat a higher price in this example we\nwill use Litecoin but you can also apply\nthe strategy to coins like ethereum we\nwill use popular exchanges such as\nbinance coinbase buybid or any other\ncrypto wallet and the second exchange\nwill be Rod nexus.com if you compare the\nLitecoin rate on binance and revex you\nwill notice that it is 7 to 10% higher\non revex this means that we can buy\nLitecoin or any other coin on binance\nand sell it on Revo Deus making a profit\nof 7 to 10% on each transaction\ndepending on the initial investment I'm\nsure that binance bybit and coinbase do\nnot need to be introduced as these are\nwell-known exchanges but let me tell you\na little bit about Revo Deus this\nexchange has been operating since 2014\nand is actively represented on Instagram\nand telegram which makes it a reliable\nand wellestablished platform it is\nexpected that she will continue work in\nthe long term and for more information\nyou can check out their website or\nsocial media channels now let's look at\nan example of a $10,000 deal and\ncalculate the potential profit between\nbinance and\nrevelex first log into your wallet go to\nthe account replenishment page copy the\nLitecoin address and initiate the\ntransfer from binance to revex\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\nas soon as Litecoin arrives on revex go\nto The Exchange page and exchange it for\n7 to 10% more expensive compared to what\nyou originally paid on binance as a\nresult you will receive a profit of of 7\nto 10% of the initial Litecoin amount of\n$10,000 next you will want to withdraw\nusdt back to any crypto wallet just go\nto the wallet Tab and then withdraw\nfunds enter the address for withdrawing\nfunds from your chosen wallet for\nexample binance I recommend using the\ntrc20 network because of its speed and\nlow transaction fees finally click the\nwithdraw button and watch as the funds\nare successfully returned to Finance\ncompleting the Arbitrage round with a\nprofit of 7 to 10% of your\n$10,000 this example shows that the\nlarger the initial investment the more\nprofit you can achieve in just one trade\nand all this in just five minutes you\ncan continue to increase the initial\namount and repeat this process several\ntimes increasing your profit each time I\nstrongly recommend using the strategy\nbefore the opportunity closes don't for\nforget to subscribe to the channel like\nthe video and follow the update so as\nnot to miss new interesting strategies\nsee you soon and may have a great day\nfilled with big profits\n",
