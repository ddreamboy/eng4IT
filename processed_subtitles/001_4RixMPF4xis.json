  "text": "artificial intelligence and machine\nlearning what's the difference are they\nthe same well some people kind of frame\nthe question this way it's AI versus ml\nis that the right way to think of this\nor is it AI\nequals\nml\nor is it AI is somehow something\ndifferent than ml\nso here's three equations\nI wonder which one is going to be right\nwell let's talk about this first of all\nwhen we talk about AI I think it's\nimportant to come with definitions\nbecause a lot of people have different\nideas of what this is so I'm going to\nassert the simple definition that AI is\nbasically exceeding or matching\nthe capabilities of a human so we're\ntrying to match the intelligence\nwhatever that means and capabilities of\na human subject\nnow what could that involve there's a\nnumber of different things for instance\none of them is the ability to discover\nto find out new information another is\nthe ability to infer to read in\ninformation from other sources that\nmaybe has not been explicitly stated and\nthen also the ability to reason\nthe ability to figure things out I put\nthis and this together and I come up\nwith something else so I'm going to\nsuggest to you this is what AI is and\nthat's the definition we'll use for this\ndiscussion now what kinds of things then\nwould be involved if we were talking\nabout doing machine learning well\nMachine learning I'm going to put that\nover here is basically a capability\nwe'll start with a Venn diagram machine\nlearning involves predictions or\ndecisions based on data think about this\nas a very sophisticated form of\nstatistical analysis it's looking for\npredictions based upon information that\nwe have so the more we feed into the\nsystem the more it's able to give us\naccurate predictions and decisions based\nupon that data it's something that\nlearns that's the L part rather than\nhaving to be programmed when we program\na system I have to come up with all the\ncode and if I wanted to do something\ndifferent I have to go change the code\nand then get a different outcome in the\nmachine learning situation what I'm\ndoing could be adjusting some models but\nis different than programming and mostly\nit's learning the more data that I give\nto it so it's based on large amounts of\ninformation and there's a couple of\ndifferent fields within couple of\ndifferent types there is supervised\nmachine learning and as you might guess\nthere's an unsupervised machine learning\nand the main difference as the name\nimplies is one has more human oversight\nlooking at the training of the data\nusing labels that are superimposed on\nthe data unsupervised is kind of able to\nrun more uh and and find things that\nwere not explicitly stated\nokay so that's machine learning it turns\nout that there's a subfield of machine\nlearning that we call Deep learning\nand what is deep learning well this\ninvolves things like neural networks\nneural networks involve nodes and\nstatistical relationships between those\nnodes to model the way that our minds\nwork\nand it's called Deep because we're doing\nmultiple layers of those neural networks\nnow the interesting thing about deep\nlearning is we can end up with some very\ninteresting insights but we might not\nalways be able to tell how the system\ncame up with that it doesn't always show\nits work fully so we could end up with\nsome really interesting information not\nknow in some cases how reliable that is\nbecause we don't know exactly how it was\nderived but it's still a very important\npart of all of this realm that we're\ndealing with so those are two areas and\nyou can see DL is a subset of ml but\nwhat about artificial intelligence where\ndoes that fit in the Venn diagram\nand I'm going to suggest to you it is\nthe superset of mldl and a bunch of\nother things what could the other of\nthings be well we can involve things\nlike natural language processing uh it\ncould be vision\nso we want a system that's able to see\nwe might even want a system that's able\nto hear and be able to distinguish what\nit's hearing and what it's seeing\nbecause after all humans are able to do\nthat and that's part of what our brains\ndo is distinguish those kinds of things\nit can involve other things like the\nability to do text to speech\nso if we take written words Concepts and\nbe able to speak those out so this first\none involved being able to see things\nthis is now being able to speak those\nthings as well\nand then other things that humans are\nable to do naturally that we often take\nfor granted is motion this is the field\nof Robotics which is a subset of AI the\nability to just do simple things like\ntie our shoes open and close the door\nlift something walk somewhere that's all\nsomething that would be part of human\ncapabilities and involves certain sorts\nof perceptions calculations that we do\nin our brains that we don't even think\nabout so here's what it comes down to\nit's a Venn diagram and we've got\nmachine learning We've Got Deep learning\nand we've got AI so I'm going to suggest\nto you the right way to think about this\nis not these equations those are not the\nway to look at it in fact what we should\nthink about this as machine learning is\na subset of a high\nand that's how we need to think about\nthis when I'm doing machine learning in\nfact I am doing AI when I'm doing these\nother things I'm doing AI but none of\nthem are all of AI but they're a very\nimportant part\nthanks for watching please remember to\nlike this video And subscribe to this\nchannel so we can continue to bring you\ncontent that matters to you\n",
