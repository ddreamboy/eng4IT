  "text": "[Music]\nall attendees and welcome to another\nglorious day of learning by ed Eureka it\nis so good to see that so many of you\nare keeping up with the trends of\ntechnology today my name is Adan and\nafter our previous sessions on the\nInternet of Things I thought it'd be\nonly fair to talk about the devices that\nenable the inner of things to sense and\nrespond using the powers of computing to\nautonomously come up with the best\nsolutions for any industry today so let\nus dig deeper into these devices that\nmark the beginning of every IOT\necosystem and look at the best ones in\nuse today in different domains but\nbefore we start though let me quickly\nrun you along the outlines of today's\nsession so that you have a clear idea on\nthe topic that I'd be covering so first\nI'll be telling you how you can identify\nany object to be an IOT device then I'll\ntell you what they can do for you and\nsite some of the major use cases in it\nand then I'll tell you how I ot devices\nare shaping the entire world and code\nsome leading examples and then I'll tell\nyou how secure is a device in IOT and\nfinally I'll be telling you all the\nimportant things that you need to know\nto build an IOT device so without\nputting it off any further let us begin\nour session today now these devices that\nplay the role of things in IOT are\nwhat's make the smartest systems\npossible today we just a smart appliance\nor an entire smart city it could be\ncomplete computing devices design\nkeeping the portability in mind or tiny\nelectronic components operating on\nminimal device software for data\ntransfer and connectivity without any\ncomputing abilities at all and there are\nalso objects that are not made up of any\nelectronic hardware at all and can still\nbecome the things in IOT by having these\nsmart things attached to them in some or\nthe other way so what I'm basically\nsaying is that even we humans can become\na thing in the Internet of Things but\nagain that is a contextual term and\nyou'll understand why as we move on with\nthe session today so for now we can just\nsay that any device however puny or\npowerless with the ability to receive or\nsend data allowing it to communicate\nover networks can be called a thing or\nan IOT device also it should be serving\na purpose like either collecting some\ninformation or delivering some outcome\nnow that is the least any IOT enabled\ndevice or thing in IOT will require\ntoday even though the bigger devices\nhave diverse features and can be more\npowerful it is the miniaturizing of\ncoming\nhardware that has truly given the\ninternet-of-things its edge in the\nmarket today it has made it possible for\nthese IOT devices to even function at\nmicroscopic levels in the remotest\ncorners of our world and has also bought\nin focus on more target oriented\nfeatures specific to their goals plus\nwith devices running on incredibly low\npower levels and operating with such\nminimal resources the things in IOT come\nwith the promise of implementing\nsolutions in the most cost effective way\npossible without compromising on the\nsystem's accuracy this is because are\nthe smallest levels these things are\nembedded with just enough technology for\nthem to communicate over the internet\nand other networks to get the data\nanalyzed stored and processed over that\nnetwork or over the cloud rather than\nphysically housing all those\ntechnologies on themselves also such low\npowered levels are perfect for the\nlittle chips sensors and other\nlow-energy components that these devices\nused for the operation but like I said\nthey're substantially equipped to\nconnect wirelessly for exchanging data\nand performing actions based on them\nalso such low energy modes of\nconnectivity make it easy for these\nthings to operate just about anywhere\nwhile letting us control and monitor\nthem remotely for almost any part of the\nworld so it is as if the British\ntechnology pioneer Kevin Ashton who\ncoined the phrase integral of things\nback in the 1999 somehow knew of these\npotentials that IOT brings out in\ndevices today ok I can see that somebody\nhas a question\nso Thomas wants to know if it is only\nthese small devices that are a part of\nIOT or even the larger devices can be\ncalled things well Thomas any device\nthat has the ability to connect to\nnetworks and can solve a purpose like\nperforming some operation or collecting\ndata can be called a thing in IOT\nalthough in turn of thing aims to be\navailable for even the smallest devices\nso I hope that answers your question so\nlet us move on\n[Music]\nlet us see what things can do for you so\none of the most popular implementation\nof these things and their applications\nhave been in the sector of home\nautomation today the use of Internet of\nThings in this industry has got the\nworld closer to achieving a dream home\npowered by the smartest systems using\nthese IOT devices and these systems have\nbeen built such that all its devices can\ninter communicate to allow owners a\ncustomized access to all aspects of your\nhome like your lights your logs or the\ninside environment or security cameras\nor even your total energy consumption\nwith the brand specific IOT platforms\nand clouds behind them these IOT devices\nare now capable of exhibiting ambient\nintelligence and also stay connected to\nthe Internet for driving real-time\noperations so let us get into some\nexamples of IOT devices using more smart\nhomes today and we must begin with the\ntunable smart lighting systems like\nPhilips hue smart home lighting or the\ntp-link multicolor smart Wi-Fi that can\nbe easily controlled using your smart\nphones with the option of creating\ncustom lighting automations from\nanywhere in the world by just being\nconnected to the internet with smart\nlights like these you could turn them on\nor off any time and tune the color and\nthe brightness of lights in your homes\nremotely no matter wherever you are\nmoving on did you know that locks and\nkeys are getting old fashioned nowadays\nfor all job smart locks are a part of\nalmost every smart home today and the\nAugust smart lock third generation is\none of the newest and the hottest phones\non the market today what makes it stand\nout among its peers is that it comes\nwith bluetooth support so that you won't\nneed to worry even if your internet is\ndown somehow with a device like this\nthen attaches to your existing deadbolts\nyou'll always know if your door is\ncompletely closed and alone with its\ndoor Sense technology it will even\nremind you to lock your doors when\nyou're leaving or tell you if they were\nproperly closed or not based on the\nlocation of your phone you can even\ncreate secure virtual or temporary keys\nfor your neighbors and guess just in\ncase now the next IOT device is the Nest\nLearning Thermostat\nit is one of the best examples of an IOT\ndevice today as a part of your home\nautomation system this intelligent\ndevice learns your schedules and\npreferences over the first couple of\nweeks to smarten the cooling and heating\nsystems in your home and then regulate\nyour home temperature automatically to\nsave your electricity by 20% among a ton\nof other features\nso to reduce your energy bills it uses\nsensors and your phone's location to\nrealize the weather the time or the\nenvironment inside and when nobody's\nhome it will shift into energy-saving\nmode apart from the thermostat nest also\nprovides smart cameras with smoke and\ncarbon monoxide alarms to better manage\nyour home's atmosphere and its security\nplus it lets you manage and monitor each\nof them through its dedicated app or\neven build your old revenue channels\nupon them there is also one more device\nthat I think is worth the mention in the\nhome automation systems of today it's\nmostly just a doorbell for your front\ndoors only a lot smarter the video\ndoorbells by ring is a modest name for\nall the things that it can do it's like\nyou're always home as it lets you answer\nyour door from just about anywhere it\nwill in fact even a lot U of motion\nwithin 30 feet of your door and stream\nits life footage onto your phone and if\nsomebody rings a bell you can let them\nknow that you not home and even have a\nword with them with its night vision\nthe wide-angle high-definition\nrecordings get simultaneously saved work\nloud for you use anytime now before I\ntell you what else i ôd devices can do\nfor you\nvirtual or home assistants like the\nAmazon Alexa the Google assistant CD and\nG book are also a trending application\nof the Internet of Things and have made\nit big in the home automation systems of\ntoday now other than making your home\nsmart IOT devices are also capable of\nintelligently tracking your health and\nfitness and as far as Fitness goes the\nFitbit tracker or the Apple watch and\nother such smartwatches have been a\nrevolutionary success and along with\nyour fitness aspects they also solve\nyour day-to-day healthcare needs like\nchecking your heart rate and\nperspiration levels and tracking your\nbody temperature to predict a cold or a\nflu on the way and you'll be amazed to\nknow how the other IOT devices are\nsaving more lives and making health care\nbetter like the Philip Health Care's\nmedication dispensing service or the\nhero smart pills dispenser are the most\nsuccessful use cases today and exemplify\nthe potential of IOT in the healthcare\nsector it is the perfect reminder for\nyour medications and is a convenient\nmeasure for the elderly and the sick\nalike the option to remotely manage it\nwith your smartphone you could also\nmonitor the medication of your near and\ndear ones and be notified upon running\nlow on any medication at all plus you\ncould also get info on the right\nmedication\nfor common health hazards and now with\nhow integral smartphones and internet\nhave become in our lives\nhealth and fitness solutions using IOT\nwill only get more and more prominent in\nthe recent years to come\n[Music]\nso apart from the personal benefits that\nyou can get as a consumer or a user IOT\nalso aims to impact the greater good the\ntalk of smart cities is prevalent these\ndays while the waste management system\nis more efficient pollution in the\nenvironment is checked and even the\nouter lighting and traffic signals are\nequipped with motion sensors to ensure\nenergy conservation by turning on only\nupon detecting traffic updates and its\nroute or upon sensing pedestrians and\nvehicles nearby now let us look at some\nof the other sectors of service and\ncivic amenities that these IOT devices\nare powering to up the efficiencies of\nour world today one of the most visible\nsmart systems in place is in the domain\nof Transport and automotive today and\nalong with more and more connected car\nplatforms today there has also been a\nlot of hype around smart incent driving\nvehicles hitting the lines of transport\nvery soon plus with the maps providing\nreal-time Intel and the modern vehicles\nhousing numerous sensors in them you\ncould always tell which way to go or\nwhat parts need to be looked at like say\ntracking the fuel consumption altitude\nand maintenance issues of flights in\nreal time without waiting for it to land\nevery time can help in anticipating\nproblems to schedule maintenance prior\nto its arrival\nso that delays and mishaps are minimized\nin the aviation industry another major\narea of application for IOT devices is\nin the field of Agriculture a sector\nthat is often neglected despite its\nutmost importance can now be brought up\nto speed with IOT with several cheap and\nminimal sensors that monitor the best\nclimate and soil quality for the right\nkind of crops or other smart devices\nthat ensure the efficiency of automated\nirrigation systems even the gardens in\nyour home or the trees in smart cities\nor even the plant life and vegetation in\nthe agroforestry or wildlife habitats\ncould be kept in check the most\ninnovative IOT devices today include the\nsmart watering system blossom which can\ncreate optimal watering schedules for\nall the plants in your home based on\nreal-time weather data and focus and\nwill regulate all your sprinkles\naccordingly and allows you complete\ncontrol over them through Bluetooth or\nthe internet and also the clean gross\ncarbon nanotube Pro\nis one of the best IOT devices for\nfarmers and gardeners all around the\nworld today with sensors to monitor the\nintake of nutrients in the crops to\nbetter manage farming resources and\nimprove the quality of their fields\nfarmers can now alter the maturity rate\nand the color of crops for better yields\nand faster rates of production now it\nmight be a little ironical of me to talk\nabout one of the very first industries\nto be made smart on such a late note in\ntoday's session but I really just wanted\nto save the best for last and believe me\nthe sector of retail and logistics is\nwhere the internals thinks promises the\nmost astounding results with IOT devices\nalready being extensively used in\nshopping restaurants hospitality\nindustries and many other businesses to\ncontrol the supply chain effectively and\nobtain valuable insights based on them\nand manage their logical or\nmerchandising expenses in the best\npossible ways now the cue hop is one of\nthe leading examples of internal things\nbeing used in the retail today typically\ndesigned to bring in seamless autonomous\ncheckout technologies to all retail\nverticals by digitizing the checkouts\nthrough RFID tags that only unlock after\nits payment is processed the sole\npurpose behind it was to allow users to\nself checkout in stores although it is\nmainly used for security reasons today\nto inhibit petty thefts in stores but\nguess what\nthat was before the inception of Amazon\ngo earlier this year now the technology\ninside this convenience store will\nreally seem like it was pulled out from\nthe future somewhere although it is so\nnew that there are only three locations\nwith this futuristic store so far so\npretty and managed by the online\nretailer Amazon these stores can give\nyou a shopping experience unlike any\nyou've ever had before with the idea\nessentially being grab-and-go these\nstores will just need your Amazon go\napps for you to enter and then employees\ncomputer vision machine learning and\nsensor fusion to automatically add items\nthat you pick instantly on to your\nvirtual cart and we'll also remove them\noff just as promptly if you keep them\nback now once you grab all the things on\nyour shopping list and are ready to exit\nall you need to do is just walk right\nout of the store yes no more lining up\nin busy queues of the usually limited\ncheckout counters to wait your turn for\nthe purchase you can exit the store\nwithout even having to pull out any cash\nor a card and you will find the amount\nfor all the things that you walk out\nwith\nsimultaneously from the balance in your\nAmazon account such a smart system could\nalso check the inventory regularly to\nnotify retailers on the need for\nrestocking and even helps to manage the\nsupply chain and a better way now there\nare also other promising areas in\nlogistic that IOT devices have started\nto impact like in the case of shipping\ncargo or fleet management smart\nBluetooth low-energy tags are attached\nto the items being moved for remotely\ntracking their exact locations speed of\ntransport and storage conditions for\ninstance the things dot IO is a simple\nIOT platform that provides a dedicated\ncloud-based dashboard for better\nlogistics by enabling access to\nreal-time and reliable inputs from its\nconnected smart sensors and parent\nlocation trackers irrespective or\nwherever they might be so all the use\ncases and the respective IOT devices or\nthings we just went over are only a\nselect few out of the countless\napplications of the internal things that\ncan drive almost any sector today and\nthese IOT devices could be things\nthemselves or even attached to someone\nor something to make it a thing in IOT\nlike even a person with a heart rate\nmonitor could be your thing in IOT as it\nconnects and provides information they\ncan act as inputs to other smart systems\nto operate on so the baseline for\nanything to become an IOT device could\nbe laid out as any object with a unique\nIP address for communication over\nnetworks and the ability to gather and\ntransmit data or receive data and\nperform tasks based on it and the Ameri\ntechnology in these devices are what\ninteract with either the internal States\nor the external environment to capture\nall data and drive decisions made upon\nthem\n[Music]\nnow with the internet-of-things being\nsuch a large community of different\ndevices the challenges of IOT devices\nmainly start with communication as the\nprotocols and languages used by each of\nthem vary hugely due to the lack of\ncommon standards for all of them here\nand this lack of a uniform and secure\nstandard across all IOT devices uses\ngreat security risks making them highly\nunreliable on most important operations\nand Inter operations today also without\ncustomers being assured of the privacy\nand security of their data there is just\nno reason for them to risk using or\nadopting such insecure solutions but do\nyou really understand what the role of\nsecurity in IOT devices is today well\nlet me tell you about a major cyber\nattack that happened back in October of\n2016 a large distributed\ndenial-of-service attack dubbed Mirai\naffected DNS servers on the east coast\nof the United States which disrupted\nservices all across the world upon\nfurther investigations this issue was\ntracked back to the hackers that\ninfiltrated smart networks through the\nIOT devices being used in them like the\nrouters or the camera so that brings\nabout the situation wherein our devices\nand data are all remotely connected and\nstored upon these networks and its\nsecurity gets compromised\nwe might even not know it over the first\nfew days or weeks and it might be just\ntoo late by the time we do realize\nanother way in for these hackers were\nundoubtably a result of poor practice at\nsome end like say the use of default\npasswords rather than changing them\nhence the adoption of better practices\nand the reinforcement of proper\nauthentication networks segmentations\nencryption and cryptography can still\nmake the things and its systems quite\nsecure given that we start making sure\nof building them up securely from our\nend as well plus the issue of overall\nconnectivity is also a feat that our\nworld is still striving to achieve but\nhasn't been able to accomplish it\n[Music]\nthat brings us to the last topic for\ntoday\nso let me tell you the important things\nthat you should know to build an IOT\ndevice so building an IOT project or\ndevice or solution must be done thinking\nabout the relevant purposes that it\nconcerns and the ways in which they can\nbe prepared to work for at least the\nnext couple of decades along with the\noption and space for quick\nimprovisations and upgrades and just\nlike we saw in all our examples today\nyou must have understood the two\nimportant categories that IOT devices\nare mainly made up of the first is the\nhardware aspect and the underlying rule\nis to aggregate the hardware in the most\nminimal way you can without compromising\non the primary features that you want\nyour device to use now these features\nare mostly due to Bluetooth Low Energy\nsensors or beacons connected to the\nInternet or a customized product with\nprobably a combination of these on a\ncircuit board made up of a semiconductor\nlike Silicon and may also house or the\ncomponents like transistors resistors\nreceivers transmitters actuators an\nintegrated circuit or a microchip\nso most devices like a smartphone or a\nresult of such combinations on a little\nmore complex level with proper casing\nand with the second most important\naspect of these devices so the second\nimportant category in IOT devices is the\nsoftware aspect on the device level the\nsize of your software would depend on\nhow minimal or bulky your device is and\nwhat are the components that your\nhousing on it on the most basic note the\ndevice software only needs to be enough\nfor handling the operation of your\ndevice driving components to collect\ndata and converting them into\ntransmissible form connecting to\nnetworks driving the transmitter to send\ndata and the receiver to receive data to\nand from the network and converting it\nto the machine understandable form for\ndriving components to perform some task\nor display some outcomes based on the\nreceived instructions now all this will\nrequire very minimal\nsoftware unlike the software on your\nphones that come with entire mobile\noperating systems all the other\nimportant software for intelligence and\nsmartness in these devices will be\nprovided by the underlying cloud\ninfrastructure and even by the mobile\napps or web dash boots the software\naspect of IOT devices is in fact what\ncontrols the hardware aspects to sense\nsome information or perform an\ninstruction while both aspects are the\nmost into\nparts of an IOT device you might also\nneed to overcome a few more hurdles\nbefore you I Oh TA device is truly ready\nto implement smart solutions and power\nsmart systems of our oil today these\nhurdles could be connectivity issues or\ncompatibility problems or security and\nprivacy concerns but don't let the\nobstacles dishearten you instead just\nconsult people with knowledge on the\nsame for any and all questions that you\nhave or just post it in the comment\nsections below and I'll get you all the\nhelp that I possibly can so that will be\nall for today\nI hope to see you all again until then\nhappy learning and Cheers\nI hope you have enjoyed listening to\nthis video please be kind enough to like\nit and you can comment any of your\ndoubts and queries and we will reply\nthem at the earliest do look out for\nmore videos in our playlist and\nsubscribe to any Rekha channel to learn\nmore happy learning\n",
