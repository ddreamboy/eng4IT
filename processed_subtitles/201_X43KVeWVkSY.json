  "text": "hi guys this is akil and today i would\nbe covering up the concept of cloud\ncomputing architecture\nbut before that i would request you guys\nto subscribe our video channel along\nwith that you can like our video\nyou can find the details uh just below\nour video now let's look into what we\nhave for today's session\nso today we will be covering up why we\nrequire cloud computing\nuh what is cloud computing technology\nuh what are the benefits of cloud\ncomputing\nand uh the two main architecture pillars\nof cloud computing\nalong with that other components of the\ncloud computing technology\nnow why do we require cloud computing\nlet's look into it\nso earlier what was happening\nbefore the cloud computing technology\nthe organizations were facing some\nchallenges challenges in terms of\non-prem infrastructure\nso on-prem infrastructure on-prem setup\nis expensive\nit is less scalable\nbecause you have already procured the\ninfrastructure so the scalability\nbecomes lower\nalong with that they require a lot of\nhuge space for the servers\nif in case you have lost data in the\non-prem it becomes\ndifficult to recover them\nalong with that it takes long deployment\ntimes\napart from that the other challenges\nwere the lack of flexibility\npoor data security\nless collaboration with the inter\ninfrastructure\nand the data cannot be accessed remotely\nthough data can be accessed remotely but\nthere were some challenges in terms of\nthe security\nnow all these challenges\nwere basically overcome when the cloud\ncomputing technology was introduced\nso before cloud computing managing files\non a local storage was also difficult\nbut\nwith the introduction of cloud computing\nwhat we got we saw that\nthere is no server space required so\nnothing needs to be set up in the\non-prem infrastructure no experts\nrequired for hardware and software\nmaintenance because that would be done\nby the cloud computing vendor itself it\ngave a better data security\nand the disaster recovery setup is\nfantastic in terms of the cloud\ncomputing technology\nalong with that\nease of deployment the deployment\nactivities become\nare easier in terms of setting up on the\ncloud computing platforms it is cost\neffective you pay as you go there are on\ndemand services\nmanagement of services easy\nas well as the collaboration is also\nefficient so\ncloud computing is generally better than\nthe on-prem infrastructure because of so\nmany advantages it has\nnow\nwe have seen the advantages of the cloud\ncomputing why the organizations opt for\nthe cloud computing but what is actually\nthe cloud computing technology is\nso cloud computing is basically the\ndelivery of on-demand resources so\nanything which you need that is\navailable\nso\nsuch as server database software\nand they are accessible over the\ninternet so here in the diagram you can\nsee\nthat a computer or desktop can access\nany\nservice over the internet so it's\nbasically related to server database and\nthe softwares\nit also gives the ability to build\ndesign and manage applications on the\ncloud platform\nnow you just have to note that companies\noffering these computing services are\ncalled as the cloud providers so like\naws google cloud these are all the cloud\nproviders\nthe cloud computing service providers\nare called as the vendors\nthey provide services to manage the\napplications through a global\ninfrastructure or a global network\nsome of the examples as i mentioned aws\nmicrosoft azure as well as google cloud\nso these are the three primary cloud\nproviders in the market\nlet's look into what are the benefits of\nusing the cloud computing\nit is easily upgraded\nsometimes the upgrades are managed by\nthe vendor itself so there are no\nhassles in terms of doing the upgrades\nit is cost efficient since these are on\ndemand services so you pay as you use or\nyou pay as you go\nthe scalability\nis almost you can say unlimited depends\non the setup or the infrastructure of a\ncloud vendor and you can scale as much\nas you require\nand\nit provides you a lot of services where\nyou can do the automation so you can\nbasically create your applications\nand you can automate them\nyou can even deploy your application\nusing the automation it is highly\navailable the reason is that they have a\nredundant infrastructure so you can\ncreate or deploy your applications which\nwill be highly available\nflexible so you can shift between the\nservices you can shift between the\ninfrastructure whenever you need\nalong with that it gives you the better\nsecurity in terms of managing your\napplications along with the databases\nand you can do the customization as per\nyour requirement\nnow let's understand\nwhat do we mean by the cloud computing\narchitecture\nso this diagram represents the cloud\ncomputing architecture where you can see\nthere is a cloud infrastructure which we\ncall as a front end front end means the\ninfrastructure that is network facing\nthat is internet facing and the back end\nis where actually the application the\nservices\nand the devices are\nlike storage servers and all\nalong with the management and the\nsecurity portals\nso primarily the cloud computing\narchitecture has two components one is\nthe front end and the other one is the\nback end\nnow with respect to the architecture the\ncloud computing is architecture as we\ndiscussed earlier is divided into two\nparts front end and the back end it\nprovides applications and interfaces\nthat are required for the cloud-based\nservices\nso front-end would be anything which is\nfacing the internet for example\nthe websites that you deploy they are\nfront-end because they are accessed by\nthe\npublic over the public network\nthese applications basically such as web\nbrowser google chrome and internet\nexplorer over which you can basically\nopen up your web applications your\nwebsites and also it includes client and\nmobile devices along with some apis\nso this is with respect to the front end\narchitecture\nnow\nlet's look into the\nfurther more concepts related to the\nfront end so in the front end the cloud\ninfrastructure\nconsists of a hardware and the software\ncomponents that includes a data storage\nserver virtualization software etc\nalso it provides the gui\nwe call it as a graphical user interface\nto the end users so that they can\nperform the respective task so it's a\ngui based access and those who are not\nfrom the coding background or they don't\nhave familiarity with the cli it is an\nadvantage\nnow let's understand the back end\narchitecture\nso the back end is basically it manages\nall the programs that runs\nthe application on the front end\nso whatever is required to support the\napplications for example web\napplications which are running on a\nfront end\nwould be available in the back end\nit has the larger number of data storage\nsystems and server so it is basically it\ncomprises of the entire infrastructure\nof a cloud provider\nand it can also be a software or it can\nbe a platform as well\nso based on the requirement the\napplication provides output to the end\nusers in the back end\nalso it is one of the most important\ncomponents in the cloud because it is\nyou can say a backbone of a cloud\ncomputing architecture\nand its task is to provide utility in\nthe architecture\nand the few services that are widely\nused among the end users are storage\napplication development environments and\nthe web services\nin the back end with respect to the\nstorage it maintains and manages any\ntime of any amount of data over the\ninternet\nsome of the examples of storage services\non the cloud are s3 which is called as a\nsimple storage service\noracle cloud storage and microsoft azure\nstorage\nthe storage capacity varies depending\nupon the service providers available in\nthe market\nand also it allocates specific resources\nto a specific task it handles functions\nof cloud environment so this is with\nrespect to the management in the backend\narchitecture\nthe management in the backend\narchitecture helps in the management of\ncomponents like applications task\nservice security\ndata storage and the cloud\ninfrastructure\nand in simple terms it establishes\ncoordination among the resources\ncoming to the security aspect of a back\nend architecture\nit is an integral part of a crowd\ninfrastructure because\nsince you it mostly relies on the\nstorage and the databases so it has to\nbe more secure it helps in protecting\ncloud resources system files and the\ninfrastructures\nalso it provides security to the cloud\nservers with virtual firewalls and\nresults in the prevention data loss\nnow the different components of the\ncloud computing architecture one is the\nhypervisor\nsecond is the management software\nthe third one is the deployment software\nfourth one is the network\nfifth one is the cloud server\nand you have the cloud storage\nnow let's look into what we have with\nthe hypervisor\nhypervisor as the name suggests is a\nvirtual operating platform and that is\nbasically used by every user\nit runs a separate virtual machine on\nthe back end which consists of a\nsoftware and the hardware\nalso it maintain objective its main\nobjective is to divide and allocate\nresources so basically the hypervisor is\nprimarily used to\nvirtualize the physical machines so that\nit can be shared across with many\nresources or many users\nthe management software its\nresponsibility is to manage and monitor\nthe cloud operations so all the\noperational tasks are basically done by\nthe management software\nit helps in improving the performance of\nthe cloud since\nyou can do the admin task as well for\nexample high security flexibility\nfull-time access and the access given to\nother\nusers who would be working on the cloud\nplatform\nthe deployment software consists of all\nthe mandatory installations and\nconfigurations that are required to run\na cloud service\nevery deployment of cloud service is\nperformed using a deployment software so\nit is primarily used for deploying the\napplications or a software\nso that basically saves the time of a\nin terms of deploying their codes\nnow the three different models which can\nbe deployed are\nthe software as a service which we call\nas a sas so the software as a service\nmeans it hosts the software and manage\nthe application of the end user example\nis gmail so gmail is an example of a sas\nservice where\nit tax has a mailing service\nand the users just have to create their\nemail accounts and start using the\nservice the pass is basically a platform\nas a service and it helps\nto develop and build and deploy the\napplications on the software primarily\nused by the coders they can concentrate\nmore on their development activities\nand less\nfocus on the infrastructure part\nexample is microsoft azure and the\ninfrastructure as a service is is\nbasically to provide services on pay as\nyou go pricing\nmodel\ncoming to the component of a cloud\ncomputing architecture that is network\nso\nwhat is with respect to network why do\nwe need a network so it connects the\nfront end and the back end together so\nthe network can be the internal private\nnetwork of a cloud computing provider as\nwell as the public network and also it\nallows every user to access the cloud\nresources\nover the internet\nit helps users to connect and customize\nthe route and protocol so\nlet's say an admin wants\na particular ips to be blocked so you\ncan specify them and customize them in\nthe route and the protocols\nit is a virtual server which is hosted\non the cloud computing architecture so\nit is just like a virtual\nnetworking that is available on the\ncloud computing platform\nit is highly flexible secure and cost\neffective and it is\nbasically you can say the backbone in\nterms of connecting multiple services\ntogether\nthe cloud storage is basically where\nevery data is stored and that can be\naccessed by a user from anywhere over\nthe internet\nof course it depends on how do you\nprovide the access to it\nit is scalable at runtime and it is\nautomatically accessed\nand the data can be modified and\nretrieved from the cloud storage over\nthe internet itself\nso this was about our session for today\nguys uh thank you for\nwatching this video i hope you like it\nhi there
