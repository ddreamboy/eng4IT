license\nagreement and click install\nif you click ok to this you'll lose this\nYouTube video because it will close all\nyour browser windows\nplease go up to the UIL of this video\nand market and copy it so you can find\nit after you clicked OK here\nthen when you have the address of this\nvideo you can click OK here\nthen you will click ok to force close\nall windows like that\nand we have completed the setup\nhere we can press launch uipath Studio\nto Startup UI path Studio\nnow click sign in\nthat will take you to the cloud\nuipath.com where we can automatically\nverify our installation\nfirst of all I want to say open uipath\nhere\nthen we are automatically verified I\nalso want to restore the pages from\nbefore so I click restore here then we\nare back at the uipath so let's go down\nto Studio again you can find it here\nStudio or Studio X we want to go with\nStudio always studio studio X is a light\nversion of uipath very few people use it\nyou will find very little documentation\nand help so please go with uipath Studio\nclick here\nthis is uipath I will just click don't\nshow here and close and let me maximize\nfirst I want to go to tools over here to\nthe left so I'll click it\nclick uipath extensions if you want to\ninstall browser extensions for example\nfor Firefox you can do it here that is\nif you want to automate that browser\nwe have installed Chrome and Edge for\nthe matter so we're good we will let\nthis be\nthen click settings go to design\nscroll a little bit down to use modern\nfor new projects the default is yes but\nif you had an older installation of\nuipath this will not be default so you\njust need to make sure that this is yes\nwe are to go\nwe also want to inspect the uipath\nassistant\nyou can find it out here in the tray it\nlooks like this I can double click it\nthe UI path attended manager here we can\nstart and start Automation and inspect a\nlot more\nif you see this green light up here that\nmeans that you have connected uipath to\nthe uipath assistant\nif for somehow it is red gray or blue it\nmight look like this let me just sign up\nthen I go back here you can see that\nthis is gray I just click sign in here\nand again I will just click open UI path\nand we're signed in\nif you want to find the uipath assistant\nif it's not down here in your tree then\nyou can go to your Windows start menu\nand search for uipath assistant and\nstart it right here however we're good\nso let's start building our first robot\nI'll close down the uipath system and\nlet me close down some of these browser\nveins\nI can also close down this Outlook I'm\nnot going to use my email for now\nthen we go back to wipe Studio you can\nalways start uipath studio in your start\nmenu as well by searching for uipath\nstudio and you can of course make\nshortcuts such as sending it to the task\nbar\ngo back here so when you start up uipath\nStudio it will start on start and to\ncreate a new process you go up to new\nproject process\nand then we'll give it a name I will\ncall this one uipath\nbeginners course we can specify a\nlocation to default your uipath code is\nin your documents you can change it by\nclicking this folder here and choose a\nfolder elsewhere it's good for now one\nthing that I would like to talk about is\nwhether or not you should use VB Visual\nBasic or C sharp it's both under the.net\nframework and you might be inclined to\nuse the C sharp because that's the most\ncommon language compared to Visual Basic\nbut uipath used Visual Basic since its\nbeginning that means that every\ndocumentation page every tutorial videos\neverything is in Visual Basic so unless\nyou have a very good reason to don't\nchoose to see Sharp I'll click create\nlet me skip this tour\nyeah\nand I'll open up the main workflow\nthis is where our activities go\nwe'll drag him into this canvas it's\ncalled Main and it's the default\nworkflow sequence the dependencies that\nrefer to packages linked to this project\nthese ones are default but we can\ninstall more\nhere you also see our main\nif I click activities down here here are\nour predefined code blocks\nI can drag and drop these code blocks\ninto my main sequence\nfor example I can just use a right line\nhere and I can enter the term text so\nhere I can say hello in quotation marks\nand I can run the robot this is our very\nfirst robot\nthat's it you will not see anything but\nif you go down to the output you can see\nour little message down here make the\noutput again to minimize\nyou will find a lot more actions down\nhere we can expand for example the UI\nautomation we can go into the\napplication and you can see a lot of\nactions here\nfor example I can't drag in a use\napplication browser here then I'll need\nto point to an application to automate\nlet's say I want to automate the\ncalculator so just open this this could\nbe literally any application\nthen I'll say indicate application to\nautomate here\nand you can see it turns green\nthen I will click it now we will open up\nthe windows calculator\nand if I click this use application\ncalculator then I go over here to the\nright click this little wrench here that\nthe properties and here you'll see some\nproperties\nher default our automation will close\ndown the application if it's opened it\nI'll choose never here and that's only\nbecause I want to see what's going on\noh let us close down the calculator once\nmore try to run it\nthere you go you could see that the\napplication called calculator opened in\nthe background\nlet's also say I want to click a button\nand I go back here I could of course\nfind that click action down here in all\nthese actions but I could also go up and\nsearch activities and search for a click\ndon't worry you will get used to all\nthese actions when you build that's why\nit's so important that you build build\nwith me you will learn much more than\njust passively watching so if you\nalready haven't started your uipath\nstudio please pause the video and start\nit up and build these things with me\nthen we'll take a click and drag it in\nthis do container\nhere you can see that uipath actually\nguides us it says indicate in app\ncalculator so if I click here I can\nchoose all these ones here say I want to\nchoose number five I simply just click\nleft with the mouse and uipath\nautomatically creates an address for\nthis button I can click confirm\nnow let's try to see it works and for\nSimplicity I'll close it down I run over\nhere we have the debug and if I click\nthis drop down I can choose run file\ndebug or run I'll usually just go with\nrun file that's the fastest one if we\nwant to\ndebug our code that is to make it\ncorrectly looking so there will be no\nerrors then we'll use the debug we might\nuse it a little bit later\nso I'll click run file\nnow we'll open up a calculator and we\npress number five that's it that's how\neasy it is to automate uipath\nlet's build an end-to-end project where\nI will teach you all the best UI path\npractices\nso let's delete what we have built so\nfar you just marked as use application\nthen you press delete on your keyboard\nyou could also Mark it or right click\nand then click delete\nso now we just have our main sequence\nlet's download the course materials\nto open up a browser\nand let me just close this one here here\nit is I created this course page for you\nthe link is in the video description\nbelow\nhere I want to click this gray button\ndownload course materials\nthat will take you to my OneDrive where\na zip folder with the things that we\nneed\nclick the three dots and then click\ndownload you of course also welcome to\ncreate these things yourself\nlet me just do this the calculator I'll\nplace it in my desktop\nhere I will right click and I will\nextract everything\nthat is fine I will extract it then I\ncan delete the zip file to not confuse\nmyself\nlet's go inspect the project folder so I\ndouble click it and I'll drag it in from\nmy other screen\nwe have two folders in it we have an\ninput and we have an output\nin the input you'll find an Excel book\nproducts to be scrape\nI'll open it\nthat's it\nwe have a sheet called products one that\nis the sheet that we will work on first\nhere we will look at the two products\nNike t-shirt and Asic Gel later on we\nwill take products 2 and face more\nchallenges\nagain open up uipath Studio download\nthese course materials I'll promise you\nthat you'll learn UI path much much\nfaster\nnow close this\nthen we go back to the project folder we\nalso have an output folder in it and if\nI double click here it is empty we will\nfill in the things ourselves\nso I'll close this\nI'll also go to the project folder I'll\nneed the path to this folder we will use\nit in uipath and I just hover my mouse\nover press shift in right click and\nyou'll see this copy as path emerges it\nonly works if you press shift on your\nkeyboard right on your mouse at the same\ntime then I can click copy as path I'll\ngo back to uipath make sure you click\nthe main sequence go down to variables\nhere we will create a variable\nthe variables manager will open when you\nclick variables I can click it again\ncloses now it opens\nwe will go up to name and then we will\ngive our variable a name since this is\nour project path I will call it project\noff\nit will be of the type string that's the\nmost common variable type\nin uipath a variable is a container for\na value that means that we give it a\nvalue and then we can use the name\nproject path to get that value it will\nbe very easy when these values changes\nand it's also best practice to use\nvariables when things can change a lot\nand here in the default I'll press Ctrl\nV that will be our path\na string variable in uipath is always\nsurrounded by quotation marks and we\nwill have it here\nas I said this could change a lot this\nis because we will use the project\nfolder right now on our desktop but\nimagine that we move this project into\nproduction it will definitely not stay\non our desktop\nbut for now it's fine I'll just close\nthis variables manager again\nwe want to open up a web page\nso if I go down here\nand I go to the course materials again\nwe will use the global jdsports.com that\nis just a simple sports apparel website\nit will mimic all the websites that we\ncan use for example an Erp cloud system\na CRM system anything where we search\nand we want to get data out we'll also\nclose this downloaded thing here so\nwe'll have maximum of screen\nwith that open you either need to click\nthe link on the course page or just go\nto\nglobal.jdsports.com we can go back to\nuipath\nagain we want to open up an application\nor a browser\nwe use that with the use application\nbrowser with the calculator so we can\nfind it here in recent we could of\ncourse also find it down here and let me\njust collapse this so it looks a little\nbit nicer or I can search for use\napplication slash browser we have it\nhere but it's in the recent so I can\njust do this\nI want to indicate it\nso I click here and here you can see our\nbrowser if it is orange like it is here\nit says that we cannot communicate with\nour browser we simply just need to press\nescape and fix it so go back to our\nbrowser we want to look if we have\ninstalled and activated the Chrome\nextension so go up here to extensions\nclick manage extensions\nthen scroll a little bit down here you\ncan see the uipath web automation you'll\nneed to enable this\nthis also means that we can now grab the\nbrowser I'm going to close down these\nextensions I might need to refresh the\nbrowser but let's go try it again so if\nI click indicate application to automate\nyou can see it turns green now I can\nclick with the mouse and this means that\nwe are now working at the global\njdesports.com everything we need to do\nin that browser will go in this do\ncontainer\nagain we can try to run it so if I click\nthis drop down I can click run file\nyou'll see that nothing really happens\nand that is because of some properties\nlet's try to figure out what happened\nso if I have marked this make sure you\nclick it here so the properties belong\nto that one we'll go over to Open click\nthis drop down here I can say I will\nnever open up a new browser that's a\nsetting that will really use because we\nwant to open it\nwe can also say that we always want to\nopen up an instance or the default\nsettings is that if it's not open but\nbecause we had it open it did not open\nif I choose always here then it will\nopen up a new window that's sometimes\noptimal\nhere in the close I click this drop down\nhere it will close down the browser if\nuipath opened it that's the default\nthat's this one I want to see what's\ngoing on I'll just manually close it\nwhile we develop here in the beginning\nso I'll choose never\nlet's try to run it again so I click run\nfile\nnow you see that it went really fast but\nwe opened up a new window\nI go back to uipath\nlet's try to do a search on this site so\nI go up here to activities then I'll\nfind a type into and I'll drag it into\nthe do container\nagain I need to indicate where I want to\ntype into\nI click the indicating crew here I want\nthis search buckets up here you can see\nthat this box there's a green border\naround it that's the one I want to pick\nuipath automatically\ncreate an address for us it's called a\nselector and we have multiple selector\ntypes you don't need to understand it\nnow you just need to know what it is you\nhave a strict selector we have a fussy\nselector and we have an image selector\neach one of these uipath will determine\nwhich one of these are the strongest\nIt's usually the fussy selector and then\nit will use if it cannot find that it\nwill use the image as a second result\nwe will look much more into these\nselectors and descriptors click on\njust click confirm\nso now we told you I path where we want\nto type in\nbest practice is to rename your\nactivities\nyou can see that this says type into\ninput SRC input\ngo down here and double click\nand then instead of type into input\nwhatever that is I'll delete this and\nthen I'll say search field and click\nenter it's always best practice to\nrename it up here it says use browser\nChrome JD Sports Global shop online now\nthat looks fine\nthen we can say what do I want to search\nfor\nnow I'll just hard code in the value\nthat means that I will not use a\nvariable I'll just use a string that I\ntype in here and again a string and\nuipath need to go into quotation mark\nso put in a quotation mark a new iPath\nautomatically put in the second one yeah\nI'll search for Nike t shirt like this\nI also want to send an enter click\nbecause it's not enough just to type\nthis in I want to do the search as well\nso I can place my mouse in the end I can\nclick this drop down and here I can find\nsome keyboard clicks I can find the\nenter one and UI path automatically put\nin the code for and enter click that's\nit\ntry to run it again so I go up here run\nthe file and you'll see that we open up\na new page and we do a search\nif I go back to the browser you can see\nthat we now search for night t-shirts\nand these are our results\nhere I want to extract all this data\nwhat I want here is the title the price\nand the UIL because each one of these I\ncan get inside\nand have more details so I want the URL\ntied to it one challenge is that you can\nsee here we have a normal price but on\nsome of the products it looks a little\nbit different and that is a challenge\nthat we need to face so let me scroll\nall the way up go back to uipath Studio\nnow we want to scrape the data first\nlet's make sure that we only have one\nweb page open just to make it easy for\nourselves here I have the search result\nand this was the initial page let me\njust close that one here it's only to\nmake it easier for ourselves uipath can\nfind handle it I go back to uipath this\nis structured data and it looks look at\nit again here I want to extract each\nelement and I go back to UI path uipath\nhave an extraordinary wizard for this\nand that is the table extraction so I go\nup here and click the table extraction\nI first want to pick the title so I'll\nsay add new column\nhere we can pick the title easily I can\npick the outer or the inner I want to\npick the inner because that's the most\nnarrow one it usually doesn't matter I\nlike to pick the most narrow one that\nsuits our selection here I can extract\ntext or URL I'll pick text because\nthat's what we want to extract first\nthat will be our title\nuipath automatically says well this\ntitle the all these has the same\nproperties as the one you selected I'll\ngo scrape these structured data isn't\nthat clever click confirm then I'll say\ntitle I'll also and then I can say enter\nI'll also add a new column with the URL\nso I'll click add a new column and then\nI'll pick the URL this is the same place\nas before so I'll just go click here\nextract URL\nyou can see that uipath automatically\nsays this is called title UL that's\nbecause it's the URL tied to the title\nnow I want the price\nand here you can see that there's a\nregular price for example 33 and 18 and\nthere's a sales price because those two\nare different formats that means that I\ncan choose two strategies I can either\nchoose just to have this narrow one but\nthen we might not have this one with us\nso what I will do is to grab everything\nin the price area I'll say add new\ncolumn\nand I'll grab everything I will not grab\na price here not this not this but\neverything here I'll just click and now\nyou can see that we grab everything it\nalso means that we will do some jaded\ngymnastics to get the right data out\nwhenever we have a sale but that's just\na nice challenge for us click confirm\nhere we will call this price and click\nenter\nnow we have the data that we want but\nlet me scroll down we have data on\nmultiple pages\nhere we have five pages I want to scrape\ndata on each one of these five pages so\nup here in the extract data for multiple\nPages I'll take it yes and then I'll\nneed to find a yes button next button\nsorry is this one I'll click it uipath\nautomatically creates a selector for us\nthis one I can reveal that we will face\nsome challenges with it but these are\nchallenges that we face as an RPA\ndeveloper so I really want to show you\nwhat we can do to fix all these things\nbecause you'll learn a lot just do what\nI do now we're done I'll click save and\nclose\nso if I scroll a little bit down you can\nsee uipath automatically creates a data\ntable called extract table data table I\ncan see that if I click here go to\nvariables and we have created an extract\ndata table called data table that is\nwhere uipath save the results too a data\ntable looks and appears like an Excel\nsheet except that it only exists in the\nrobot's memory that means that when we\nstart the robot and this get initialized\nit will be there but when the robot ends\nand this is actually right after this\nthe data will be gone so we need to save\nit and this usually needs to be saved to\nan Excel sheet a CSV file or similar no\nproblem we'll do that I'll minimize this\nmake sure you have this activated by\nclicking one again up here in properties\nin the timeout the default is 30 second\nthis means that it looks for the next\nbutton for 30 seconds but that might be\na little bit too long I have a fast\ninternet connection so I'll choose five\nhere you can do the same to speed\neverything a little bit up in case you\nhave a slow internet connection you\nmight just want to go with 30.\nnow let's write this data table back to\nan Excel sheet so I go up to activities\nand then I'll find a right range I can\nchoose the Excel activities those ones\nare good because they are easy to figure\nout the workbook activities though those\nones are two separate branches the Excel\nand the workbook the workbook has the\nadvantage that here we can do it without\nhaving Excel installed let's start with\nthat and let's go back to the Excel ones\nlater in the lesson so I'll find the\nright range workbook and drag it in here\nwe can fill in the data table first\nbecause that's the data that we want to\nwrite back to Excel and here we have the\nextract data table so that one is easy\nto fill in I could start to write it but\npress controls based on your keyboard\nand you will have the intellisense auto\ncompletion on press tab\nthen I can specify what sheet name do I\nwant to put it in this will be in the\nstring format so I'll have a quotation\nmark uipath automatically creates the\nsecond one\nI'll call it Nike\nteach it for now then we need a workbook\npath let me minimize this minimize this\nand this we have our project path and\nlet me double click to open it I want to\nsave into the output one so we'll need\nto find the project part we saved that\nas a variable in the beginning remember\nthen I'll go into the output and I'll\nDefine what Excel name I want to save to\nit will look like this so I go up here\npress Ctrl space again and then find the\nproject path press tab\nthen you want a plus now I need to type\nsomething in so again you guessed it\nquotation marks then I want to say\nbackwards last because I want to go into\nthe output folder and then I want to say\nwhat Excel name do I want I can type\neverything I want here I'll just call\nthis\nscrape data dot xlsx that's important\nbecause this will be in Excel file\nthat's sufficient and if I just click up\nhere you'll see that this warning\ndisappears\nyou want to go to properties and also\nadd headers that's it I can click save\nbut our workflow is also saved when we\nclick run file you can see it is a steer\nrisk next to the main that means that we\nhave unsaved changes\nI revealed that we had a problem but let\nme just show you what that problem is\nso now I run it I'll open up the JD\nSports search for it you can see up in\nthe URL that we\neasily moving with the next button\n280 Now we move back and forth between\ntwo sides so this selector for the next\nbutton is not created well something is\nwrong no problem we work with these\nselectors that is the addresses of the\nelements a lot\nlet me go back to uipath so I go back\nhere click stop\nthen we want to say I want to modify\nthis and to do so Mark the extract data\ntable click this ribbon here edit\nextract data then we will have this\nwizard pack\nto fix the next page next button\nselector I'll click this wheel here and\nhere you can see that we have something\nthat we might not want that is this from\n72 we even have an image usually we want\nto go with the strict selector when we\nwant to narrow the things down a fighter\nselector is a more generic one that can\ntake more things that look like each\nother whereas a strict selector will\nonly select one or at least select fewer\nthings than if I selector\nso mark this untick the fossil untick\nthe image click this blue one here and\nthat will open up the UI Explorer which\nis a really nice thing so if I open up\nhere I can see that this ID I don't want\nit and I can also see the header here\nthe parent here is called chrome.x and\nthen a title called night t-shirt that's\nthe one up here if I scroll down here I\ncan see this child that is the actual\nidentifier to the next button here let's\nget rid of the ID\nright now you can see that the next\nbutton is there and we can actually\nvalidate it right now because since we\nchanged it this one turns yellow uipath\ndoesn't know whether it's present or not\nit should be present now so when I click\nhere you can see that this turns green\nand it we have a check mark it's there\nsimilarly I can press the 5 let me go\ndown here I press the five now we\nshouldn't have it and it uh we can\nvalidate here\nand that's it it turns red make sure you\ngo to the one again otherwise UI path\nwill back so I can just validate once\nmore that's fine we have built a stable\nselector for the next page button it\nsays that Target element is not visible\non the screen we know that it is so we\nwill just click OK here and I'll click\nconfirm then we'll click save and close\nand we will try to run the bot once more\nto see that this next one works\nhere we navigate to all the pages it\nwill take five seconds before it it\nlooks for the next button now at the\nlast page and then it will finish\nlet's go to the output folder here you\ncan see we have created an Excel book if\nI double click it\nthere you go we have our data we have a\nlot of them we have like\n294 rows the first one is headers though\nand you can see here we still have some\nwork to do we get the prices out right\nhere that's fine but we also have some\ngymnastics to do here because I want to\nget the now price of all these sales but\nthese ones are just nice challenges for\nus\nso let me close this one again and we\nwill move on\nnow we want to instead of just searching\nfor a night t-shirt we want to extract\nmultiple search results and multiple\nPages let us go back to the project\nfolder I'll go into the input\nopen up this input sheet I want to look\nat this input sheet called products to\nbe scraped and I want to go into\nproducts one right now I want to search\nfor First Night t-shirts and then Asic\nGel so we'll create a dynamic solution\nit's very easy to do as well so let's\nget started\nto pay attention to that deprived column\nheader is called Product I'll close this\none here and go back here\nhere we can use the workbook activities\nagain but I promise you to show you the\npower of the Excel once\nI'll go up here in this start\nlet's search for an Excel process scope\nan Excel process scope is the one that\nsurrounds all RXL activities so I'll\ndrag that one in the beginning it\ndoesn't say much but what I want to do\nis to mark it then go over here the show\nExcel Window do I want to have Excel\nvisible Wildlife robot works I don't\nreally want to so I'll just click false\nbut if you like to see your Excel sheet\ngets updated you will not click faults\nhere but usually this is just a\ndistraction and a performance a little\nbit it will it will create a little bit\nof lag in performance\nso then we will use use Excel file\nthat is this one here and again you will\nlearn these actions I'll just use them\nfor now and I'll promise you that if you\nbuild these things with me and if you\nstart building your own projects this\nwill be very easy for you\nfirst of all we will need Excel file and\nhere we will need to put in a workbook\npath we still have our project path so\npress control space and find the project\npath which is here then we'll say plus\nagain as we did with the output I'll\nhave a quotation mark then I'll have it\nbackward slash I'll have the input and\nthen another backward slash now I want\nto fill in the actual name of the Excel\none here and this is product to be\nscraped xlsx\nto make sure I don't miss bill I'll just\nclick here and make sure I Mark\neverything if you don't have the\nextensions you will just add it manually\nin uipath so I Ctrl C I copy this and\nthen I'll go back here now move in here\nI'll just Ctrl V paste it in this is\nwhat I'm going to read when we want to\nrefer to this Excel file we refer to it\nas Excel\nwe're not going to create it if it\ndoesn't exist that means that if this\nsheet doesn't exist UI path will create\nit per default we're not interested in\nthat because if it's not there we don't\nwant to read something some blank one\nhere so I'll just untick the create if\nnot exists\nnow I will read this data into a data\ntable so I'll go up to activities once\nmore and then I'll find a read range and\nI'll drag it in here\nthe range I want to read let's talk a\nlittle bit about that here I just want\nto read an entire sheet and let us just\nbe 100 sure which sheet we're going to\nreach so I'll double click here\nthat one was called products one so back\nagain to uipath what I can do here is to\ngo over here in range I can go over to\nthe plus kick plus I can say Excel I can\nsay custom input\nI can say sheet and worksheet name in\nquotation mark that one will be\nproducts one\nthen I'll click save\nnow you can see that uipath creates this\nexpression for us that's the Expressions\nthat the Excel activity use you could\nwrite them yourself say Excel that is\nthis reference up here dot sheet and\nthen in quotation mark and a parentheses\nyou will have the actual sheet name\nthen we'll go down to save tune now we\nwill save it into a data table so we'll\nneed to create one we could of course\ncreate a down here in variables but a\nsmart trick is to press Ctrl K that will\ncreate a variable when we start typing\nI'll call this one\nproducts and when you click enter here\nwe have created a data table variable so\nagain when you are here in the blank one\npress Ctrl K and you can see down here\nwe have created a variable called data\ntable\nand it's mt4 now but when we start the\nrobot we read the Excel data to hit\nnow I'm going to iterate to each one of\nthese rows in the products data table\nremember that's the one that we scrape\nfrom up here we only have two goods that\nwas the Nike t-shirt and I think it was\nsome Asics huge shoes doesn't really\nmatter it was too good that we want to\niterate true but this solution will work\nif we had 100 rows in our Excel sheet\nso go up to activities and then you'll\nfind a for each row in data table since\nthis is a data table\nand drag it in here you'll see that this\nq and row this is just a name for\nreference you can say current production\nemail q and car whatever your date is\ncurrent row is fine for now but it just\nreferred to the to the row that we're\nentering through because if for each row\nand data table take the rows in the data\ntable one by one and do something about\nit so over here again I press Ctrl space\nand here you'll find the products that\nis our data table so for each one of\nthese products what do we actually want\nto do well what we want to do here\nis that we want to do this search and\nthe web scrape\nso and I will only open the browser once\nso I'll first mark this use browser and\nthen I'll drag it up here just before\nthe for each row so I'll drag it up here\ncan you see right here at the plus I've\nplaced it in\nso what I then want to do I could of\ncourse have designed it otherwise but I\nwant to show you how you move these\nthings around then I want to say in this\nbrowser instance we're still in this\nExcel one then I want to have the for\neach row in data table so mark that and\nwe want to drag it in the first just up\nhere\nso now we have it into the browser and\nwe only open the browser once but we're\ngoing to type for each one of the\nproducts and that is what we do down\nhere so press it now you press Ctrl n we\nalso want to do an extraction for each\nproduct and we want to write to an Excel\nsheet so what you will do here is that\nyou will Mark everything and then you'll\npress Ctrl X then you'll go down here\npress Ctrl V now you can nav you can cut\nand paste these activities throughout\nyour flow and let us just see what's\ngoing on we're reading the Excel we're\nusing a file then we read it into a data\ntable we open up our browser then we're\nentering to each one of these we only\nhave two products and then we will do a\nsearch for that product we will extract\nthe data and write it out to a sheet\nright now these ones will just be\nsearched for night t-shirt twice and\nwe'll override it so let's go fix that\nup here we will not have this Nike\nt-shirt we will still have this K enter\nso let us just delete the night t-shirt\nand then so we will I'll just have a\nspace I'll have a plus here in the first\none and spaces will just be ignored it's\njust an easier way to represent data now\nI want to refer to the product in this\niteration so I'll refer to the cuned row\nup here and then I'll say what column do\nI need to log in we only had one column\nremember it was called Product\nagain let me just open it so what's\ngoing on\nthat was in the products one we have\nthis column it was called Product and\nhere I just want to take this one first\nand then this one and do searches and\ndata scraving so what we will do here\nmove in here\ngo to the big beginning I'll just do\nthis control space current row and I'll\nsay dot item item is the column and I'll\nsay parentheses start quotation marks\nand then I'll say product quotation mark\nparentheses and since this is an object\nI'll say dot to string this is the net\nmethod to string this will make it a\nstring so we can use it in a type in two\nso now we search and we press enter but\nwe do it dynamically in regard to what\nproduct we have up here so that one is\nfixed the data is scraping that one was\nthe dynamic and remember we removed the\nNike from the next button then since I\nhave the product expression here let me\njust grab it up here so Mark everything\nhere Ctrl C and we will use the sheet\nname of the product so it will just look\nlike this\nnow and let me try to close these things\nhere just to make completely sure that\nwe actually scrape the data that we want\nso now I'll do this\nwe're opening up the browser we're doing\none search Nike t-shirt and then we're\nnavigating through each one of the\nactual ones so here we're taking\npage 4 page five then it will end now it\nshould write to Excel and then we should\ndo our new search in a little while\nit will be sxtl there you go\nand I only think there's one page here\nso it will just stop let us just inspect\nthat one first I'll go here you can see\nwe only have one page so just start\nthere that was nice let's also make sure\nthat we have the right data in our\noutput folder double click here now we\nhave overwritten the script data\nof course the Nike one will be all the\nsame but I have a Nike t-shirt now that\none looks the same as before let me go\nup but I also have an Asics Gel these\nones are the Asics Gel now we have done\nDynamic scraping\nI have a problem so let me close here\nthis scrape data gets overwritten from\ntime to time I usually just don't want\nto override data this bot could run say\none time each day 10 times each day and\nthen I want to save the data from each\none of the runs\nso I go back here let me instead of just\ntesting in here let me introduce you to\na nice concept as an RPA developer if I\ngo to the project here you'll see the\nproject will have the dependencies here\nthat's the packages that uipath by\ndefault users will have our main this\nmain is this one here I usually just\ncreate a test sequence instead of this\nmain so I go up here click new sequence\nand here I'll call this one test\nI will click create\nso you can see it shows up here it has\nnothing tied to to the main this is just\na playground for me to do nice things\nand test things what I need to remember\nis that in the end when we deployed this\nto production then we want to make\ncompletely sure that we don't have tests\nbecause that's just fill and disturbance\nbut for now it's nice to have a\nplayground and I all I always have this\nwhen I develop these robots\nso I marked this test I go to activities\nlet's find a message box so I'll search\nfor a message box and I'll drag it in a\nmessage box is nice for debugging it\npops up a message to the user it will\npause the robot until we click ok so\nit's nice when we want to inspect things\nI want to use the date and time for\ndoing the file naming so I go down here\npress control space then I want to say\ndate time this is again a visual\nbasic.net\ncoding so you need to know a little bit\nabout that make sure you stick to the\nend of this video where I'll recommend\nbooks about uipath and especially this\ncoding so here I'll say now that will\nget me the time of now\nand then I'll say to string because this\ndate time now will be in the date time\nformat so we can really print it out to\na message box unless we apply the.net\nmethod to string\nlet us try to run this again and again\nthis is just in our chest so it'll only\nopen up this message box now we have a\nnice date time but we have a problem and\nthat is because we cannot use this in a\nfile format we have forward slashes and\ncolons so let's make it nicer to look at\nI'll click OK this is also a nice\nexercise in working with date and times\nso I can Define the format by going here\nI can have a parentheses and now you can\nsee I see that this help says that we\nneed a provider and here I'll just have\nquotation marks and then I'll specify\nwhat format I want it out in\nI want the years that'll be four wise in\ncase you want to know what these y's\nstand for it looks a lot like the ones\nthat you use in Excel then you can\ngoogle.net custom date and time format\nstrings\nso then I'll have the month days are\nhours minutes seconds I'll use the\nseconds in the file name and that is if\nthe robot ran during this same minute\nthis will not get overwritten at this\ntime as well so let me try to run it\nagain\nand C show you that we can now use this\ntext in a file format this will be\nunique down to the last second you could\nadd middle seconds as well and in case\nyou only run runs a day you could get\nrid of these hours minutes and seconds\nfor us it's quite nice so what I will do\nhere\nis that I'll use this expression in our\nmain so I'll copy this one here and go\nto the main what we will do that in the\nbeginning when the robot starts we will\nget the current date and time we could\ndo it in the variables manager but for\nvisibility I'll put it in here in the\nend in start drawing then I'll go up\nhere I'll press Ctrl K this will create\na new variable when it is in the sign it\nwill just create a string variable I'll\ncall this now\nand then we will give it the value that\nwe just had so I'll press Ctrl V now we\nhave this one in a variable called now\nthen we can use it down here when we\nsave the data so in the right range\nworkbook I can put in the now after this\noutput and before the script data so\nwhat this will look like now we need to\ncombine again as we did before with\ncombine the variable with some\nhard-coded things so I'll end this\noutput with a quotation mark then I'll\nsay plus and I'll pick the now I'll say\nplus and a quotation mark to start this\none here I might also want to go in here\nand have an underscore so I can run the\nrobot once more\nhere we will open up the web pages and\ndo the searches once more but now we\nwill not overwrite data because the date\ntime that is a unique\nstring down to the second and of course\nour robot will not run during the same\nsecond\nhere you can see that you have finished\nnow we have the Asics Gel and we only\nhave one page\nit will finish in five seconds it looks\nfor the next button that's it and if I\ngo to this one here there you go we now\nhave Dynamic file naming everything in\nthe output folder will never be\noverwritten\ninstead of the right range workbook we\ncould go completely Excel activities it\nworks this is fine but you might want to\ngo with these Excel activities those\nones will be the Future these are so\neasy use uipath started to implement\nthem in studio X and are now using them\nhere in studio\nso if we go over here\nsince we're going to use a new Excel\nfile we're not going to\num we cannot use this use Excel file up\nhere so what we will do is down here we\nwill have another use Excel file\nI'll drag it in here so the workbook\npath well we just created it down here\nso I'll just Ctrl a Ctrl Z paste it up\nhere so now we have a workbook path\nwe will not reference it to excel\nbecause we already chose that one up\nhere so we can just call this one Excel\nresult\nwe want to create it if it not exist\nthat is because the first time it will\nnot exist so we will create it and\nfurthermore we will just overwrite it or\nsorry append to it because it already\nexists with this name\nnow we will write the data to this Excel\nsheet that will be the data from here so\ngo up here and then you'll find a right\ndata table to excel drag it in here\nwant to write well that will be the\nextract data table so I will just find\nit here\nnow go down and copy this one here so we\nhave copied this is the sheet name and\nhere we will use the same sheet\nexpression as we did up here in where we\nrefer to the sheet let me just find it\nthat will be this one here so we could\nwrite it or we could be lazy again and\nmake sure that we don't make any\nmistakes so if I go to destination I'll\ngo to plus sign make sure you pick the\nExcel results because that's the one we\nrefer to now I'll take custom input I'll\ntake sheet\nand here I will paste this one in this\nwill not be in quotation marks since\nthis is not a string a hardcoded string\nso now you'll see that I want to use the\nExcel result sheet and then we will use\nthe Q and product name as the actual\nsheet name now I can delete this this\nwill also work so if I save it and run\nthe file I could again just run file\nit's an old habit just to save it here\nand there now we run the robot and we\ncould start to close down the browser\ninstances because we are not closing in\nwe wanted to let them stay open because\nwe needed to see what what's going on\nand when the robot fails we wanted to\nsee what might have went wrong but now\nwe can see that everything works we have\nbuilt a nice robot that scrapes multiple\nproducts it's great multiple Pages it\nwrites down to excel with these few\nactions let me just show you how little\nwe just did we just did these I think\nthis we have like six or seven actions\nand we accomplish this much we still\nhave work to do but one step at a time\nand let me just minimize this let's\nclose down some of the browsers well\nthat wasn't too much\nthat will be this so if I go to my\nscraped results this will be the last\niteration we'll see that this works as\nwell I have a problem because my price\ncan take two formats one that looks well\nwe might want to move the bridge pound\nsterling and one that is really not too\nwell or at least we want to get the now\nresult\nwe can do this in several ways a very\ncool way to do it and a thing that you\nwill practice a lot as an RPA developer\nthat is regular expressions or regex so\nif I go to a browser then you want to\nsearch for regex\n101.com\nreg X is a series of characters that\ndefines a search pattern\nfirst thing you'll want to do is to\nclick this.net c-sharp that is because\nwe use the.net engine then we need our\nthings that the two formats that the\nprice can take if I go here I'll first\njust pick one of these regular ones we\ncan take the first one\ngo here paste it in in the test string\nthen you can have an inter-click doesn't\nmatter how many I'll pick one of the in\nirregular ones so Ctrl C copy it and\npaste it in here\nif we wanted to extract any British\npound out of this then we could start to\nwrite we could say British pound sign\nyou can see that we can now find it we\nwill use this search pattern in uipath\nto extract the things out then I can say\nthen I want two digits for example\ndigits here and then two have two I can\neither put in another d\nbut I'll check this one here now we have\ntwo digits and I want to Dot and another\ntwo digits so and these ones are Escape\nboth the digit sign and the DOT sign I\ndon't expect you to learn regex but I\nexpect you to do an effort in\nunderstanding this because this will\nimprove your career if you don't already\nknow what regex is so please learn this\nwith me just do these things you will\nalready learn a lot after this lesson is\ndone so this is how we could extract any\nBritish pound amount\nbut it will work up here but we'll have\na problem here because it cannot\ndetermine whether it was a was or no\nso let's just first pick the regular\nprice so what I will do here is that\nI'll delete everything I want to save\nand look at the start of a line and\nmaybe I want to say do I want the pound\nsign or not I'll not use it because I\nknow that there will be a pound sign in\nfront of each of our prices but we can\neasily say that we wanted it in here\nI'll say parentheses and I'll have\nsomething that is called a positive look\nbehind what this is is as datum can say\nlook behind something and let's move in\nhere to the equal sign let me just again\nsay what we do we have a parenthesis\nquestion mark\nthen we have this\nsmaller than and then equal and then we\ncan say what do we want to look after\nhere I want to look after a pound sign\nit will look like this we haven't picked\nany character now but we created three\nangles you can see now we look after a\npound sign we only wanted to and you can\nsee these ones here those ones are not\nso good because we don't want the Russ\nso in case we said we want only a pound\nsign at the first of a line that will be\nif a line starts then I move in front of\nthe pound signed then I'll make a hat\nlike this now we only have picked the\none where pound sign is the first one at\na line so very powerful move outside the\nparentheses then we want to say what do\nI want to look for well I want to look\nfor digits and dots so in hard brackets\nlike this hard bracket start hard\nbracket end inside the Hard bracket I\nwill tell regex what I want to look for\nI want to look for a digit and that is a\nbackwardslash digit now you can see that\nit only finds one\nbut if I move outside the hard bracket\nplace a plus now it will find one or\nmore by the way the guide over here to\nthe right is impressive it helps you a\nlot if you want to understand regular\nexpression and again I really want you\nto understand it\nso then we have the digits I also want a\nDOT so if I go in here and after the D\nI'll have a backward slash and a DOT now\nwe have a\nso this is our expression for the first\none that is the regular price but it\nwill not pick up these so we will need\nto make one from here and what we can do\nhere up here we can make a pipe that is\nthis sign called that will be an or in\nregex so now we will say if you can't\nfind this then find something else and\nhere I want to look after a now\nand what we'll do here is just to do\nexactly like we did before so I will\nhave a positive look behind once more\nlike this and in here I'll have it now\nbut be careful these two white spaces\nare not the same it might looks like two\nspaces but for some reason there are a\nlittle difference in it so just copy\nfrom now all the way to these two white\nspaces\nthen you want to go up here and paste it\nin\nand since we don't want the pound sign\nwe will say look behind a pound sign\nnow we have it you can see the only\nanchors down here we can just copy this\nwe made this expression for the digits\nor we can write it again let's practice\nour skills so we'll have a hard bracket\nbackward slash that is for the digits\nbackward slash for the dots another hard\nbracket and then we will have a plus\nsign like this so now you can see with\nthis expression we both get if it's a\nregular price but we also get if it is\nan irregular price with the both a was\nor a now\nwe will use this expression in uipath\nso go copy it I know it's a lot but I\nreally hope you do it you will learn so\nmuch\ngo back to uipath\nthen we want to go a little bit down\nbecause what we want to do when we\nextracted the data we want to make\nanother for each row in a data table and\nhere we need to be very careful because\nwe already have one here that is the one\nthat iterates to the products now we\nwill iterate through the extract data\ntable so find a for each row in data\ntable\nand drag it in\nhere we will not use the same reference\nname we already use this current row up\nhere so call it something else we could\ncall it q and line and here I want to\npress Ctrl space that will be my\nextracted data table so we want to do\nsomething\nand here I want to say I want to look\nwhatever is in the price and then I want\nto\nand make a new value to it based on my\nregular expressions\nso what you will do here is to find and\nassign\nand drag it in here and know that this\ncan be too much simply just pause or\nrewind the video is designed for that\nnow I want to say for each one of these\nlines that is referred to by the Q and\nline so control space have it here then\nI want to say what columns do I need to\nupdate and again let me just show you\nwhat we're actually doing we are\nupdating the price column so that's what\nI'm going to do here and let me just go\nhere\nI'll say that I'll have an item anime\nmouse\nparentheses quotation mark and then I'll\nsay price so this the left side is where\ndo I want to update something\nand then the right side that will be\nwhere I format what's already in there\nthis is quite small to make it a little\nbit bigger you can go over to properties\nhere to the right and click this start\nhere we can make it a lot bigger because\nnow we want to apply regular Expressions\nthis is the search pattern that we just\nhave what we will do here press Ctrl\nspace I'll say system that again you\nwill get used to this and you will use\nregular expression a lot\nlike this\nI will say regex I'll say match find a\nmatch then I'll have a parentheses then\nI want to say where do I want to look\nwell I want to look in the current line\nin the price what's what's in the\ncurrent rope that is the current line in\nthe price column so I'll just do this\none here I'll say current line and I'll\nsay current line and then I'll say\nitem then I'll say prevent a quotation\nmark\nprice so now I'm looking for that then I\nwant to apply a regex pattern so go here\nand then have a comma and now we'll have\na pattern\nput in a quotation mark because the\npattern needs to go in a quotation mark\nnow you will press Ctrl V to paste in\nyour pattern that's it we have now our\nregex pattern\nwhat I just need to do is just to make\nsure that this current line item is an\nobject so I just need to apply the\ndotnet method to string that's it\nnow we're done I can click OK What's\nHappening Here is that we're simply just\nupdating this extracted data table we're\ngiving a new value to what's in the\nprice and we do that with regular\nexpressions\nand again I can close all of the things\nthat we don't need let's try to run it\nand see that our regular expression\nworks and while we're here what do you\nthink about this course if you like it\nplease give it a thumbs up and let me\nknow in the comments what you want to\nsee next or how easy you think this is\nwhat can I do better in this guide and\nall the likes\nso here we are iterating true that is\nthe first night then we will wait five\nseconds and then we will have the Asics\nGel\nthere you go we can inspect the results\njust to see that we have what we want\nthat's it you can see we now have all\nthe prices down here and we have the\nprices nicely formatted we don't have\nthe British pound sign and we have the\ncorrect price it isn't that beautiful\nlet's say we also want the before price\nwe had it before we could add a new\ncolumn here and then we could add the\nbefore price if it's present sometimes\nit's not it's only the goods that are on\nsale\nso if let me close this one again\nwe had it in the regular Expression\nBuilder so if I go here that is the was\nprice we can create we already had this\nexpression this this works fine when\nthis works fine we know that\nnow let us delete this and try to create\none that will extract the before price\nif it's present\nagain you will use a positive look\nbehind like this and what do I want to\nlook for that will be the was\nand here I can also take the bridge\npound sterling with me I'm not really\nsure I got but make sure you copy it\nbecause these two spaces are different\nones so it will not work if you just\npress in spaces here\nthen we will have this hard bracket we\nwill have a digit Escape digit Escape D\nand Escape dot dot a DOT if we don't\nescape it it means a with then I'll have\na plus and we now have a before price\nnow go copy this expression and go back\nto uipath here I want to apply it and I\nwant to do it before we are formatting\nthe actual price because we're using the\nprice so you want to have it before but\nwe want to add a column to this extract\ndata table so what you will do here is\nto find add\ndata column and you will drag it in here\nwe will give our column a name and here\nI will just call it before\nthe data table where I will extract the\ncolumn to that will be the extract data\ntable so control space\nextract data table\nnow I want to again apply the regex I\nwant to apply the regex to the price\nthat will be this one that we're using\nhere again but I want to update the\nbefore column\nsimilar to this one oh fine sign you'll\ntake it step by step don't worry\nI'll press control space I'll say\ncurrent line and Dot\nitem\nparentheses quotation mark and then I'll\nsay before this is the column that I\nwant to update we could copy something\nhere but let's try to do it again you\nwill learn so much more\nagain we will have the right side a bit\nexpanded\ncontrol space then I want to say system\ndot text\nregular Expressions\nregex dot match and now we want to refer\nto the current line and I want to say\nthat\nitem\nI want to say price\nif things goes too fast I'll take a\nlittle break now so this is the one that\nI will look in and I'll have a color\nquotation mark and I'll paste in my\nregex\nI'll take 10 seconds here\nand in case you haven't checked out the\nDiscord community that is where we are\nmore than 5 000 RPA developers there's a\nfree invite for you and video guide how\nto sign up in the comments it's totally\nfree and you can Network and solve\nuipath problems with like-minded\nDevelopers\nnow we have this regex pattern and now\nwe're updating the before column which\nwe added up here now if I click away we\ndon't have an arrow let us also close\nthis one here so we only have one\nbrowser instance home shouldn't we go\ntest it to see that we can actually get\nthe before price out as well\nagain we are doing a lot of the same\nthings but you usually want to do that\nas an RPA developer you want to see one\nstep work at a time\nso soon we'll have the Asics Gel quick\nsearch and then we will scrape these\nthings back it will take a little bit\nlonger now because now we are applying\nthese regex to the actual extraction so\nwe heard our runtime a bit but that's\nfine\num that's how we want to do it here you\ncan see that now we have an arrow that\nis because a column name before already\nbelong to this data table\nand here that is because we need to\nchange the scope these are the\nExpressions that the error messages that\nwe'll get and what happens here let me\njust go out to the main\nso what we want to do is to make sure\nthat when we extract this data table it\nwill get reset here in this body over\nand over so let me just move this a bit\ndown and let me scroll down here now I\nwant to open up the variables so instead\nof the do that will be this do here then\nit will not get reset I want to get it\nto make it reset after each for each one\nof these iteration I can do that by only\ndefying defining it in the scope of the\nbody\nso here just change it to body this will\nsolve the error\nand what we will do here is just to see\nif it works that's the nice thing about\nyour path it's like Sudoku we will get a\nlot of problems like the selector and\nthese things Don't Panic it's it's very\nvery easy you always be able to maybe\nnot solve it the first time now you've\nseen this then you know to the next time\nbut you will be able to Google it easily\nstack Overflow you can ask on the\nDiscord again Ask in the comments here\non the YouTube video as the more\nexperienced developers if you do an\neffort we all want to help you\nif you just want projects to be solved\nwithout trying of course you will get\nlittle help on for example the Discord\nbut now you can see it works we should\nalso verify that it would indeed work so\nthis was just to change the scope a bit\nand here's the last one\nso what we have here is that X meister's\nwe now have the price and here we have\nthree sales and again we have it over\nhere we have a\nthe before price and we also had some\nsales in the end there you go we have\nnow added a before column and we could\nactually also drag out the before one\nlet's delete this we're almost done here\nbut we need to understand orchestrator\nso what we do here is that we will just\nminimize this let's remove the test\nsequence so go to Project this was the\none that we practiced where we use the\ndate so you can just right click here\nclick delete\nyes it's now gone it shouldn't be there\nwhen we move this into production\nI can now say I want to change it so I\nhave this input this product should be\nscraped\nopen it\nhere now I want to change from product 1\nto product 2. this one is just four\nproduct five products instead of two\nso and since we made such a great\nautomation that can easily be scaled we\ncan just change one thing then it will\nbe very easy for us\nso we go up here and instead of just\nreading sheet product one we can just\nread sheet products two and our\nautomation will work\ndelete this and let's try to run the\nrobot again here I will Fast Forward\nI'll click run now you will see that we\nare extracting five products how fast\nforward to the end\nthat's it we have now scraped five\ndifferent products and a lot of pages\nlet's inspect the result go to the\noutput\nthis last one here\nhere you see we have the Puma we have a\nlot of things here\nand we have the converse here\nwe have the editor shorts as Excel and a\nNike t-shirt you can see here we have\nthe price in a nice format but we had\nthis before in some weird format and\nthat is because we can just when we\ncreated the column we could specify what\ndata we want in it\nso in case we want to make it as nice as\nthe price I can just let me close this I\ncan go back to uipath then we go back to\nthe add data column go over to\nproperties and instead of this object we\ncan specify what it will if it's going\nto look the other things we will just\nhave a string I will not run the robot\nbut in case you want to see it you can\njust try to run it and verify it let me\nknow in the comments that this works\nnow we are done with our nice automation\nbut we still need a lot of things we\nneed to publish it to orchestrator and\nthis is very important because the\norchestrator is where we manage our\nprocesses that is we can make it run\nunattended that means that it can run in\nthe night on another computer\nwhat you want to do here is to hit\npublish over here\nhere we can give it a name I'll just go\nwith uipath beginners course that's the\nname we gave it in the beginning so then\nI can click next here we can publish it\nto the personal workspace feed I want to\npublish it to the orchestrator tenant\ntenant process feed I want to make it\nunattended later on so I'll process it\nhere I can click next or I can just\nclick publish now\nso we are publishing our process up to\norchestrator this means that we can use\nit in orchestrator when we want to\nschedule things or whatever we want to\ndo then you can click ok\nmake sure you are connected to the\nuipath assistant we did that in the\nbeginning but you can go down here\ndouble click the uipath assistant and\nstill verify that you have this\nagreement up here nothing will be\nchanged but in case you watch this video\nduring different days you just need to\nverify that you have it here then we can\nminimize it to three again\nlet us go to orchestrate them so and let\nus just close down all this browser\nthing again so I can close down the\nregex and one thing that we could also\nactually do to make sure that we don't\nhave these browser windows open when we\nscrape whilst that remember we could use\nthis use browser over here\nthen we chose never to close it and here\nI can say close it if it's opened by the\napp browser so just make sure that when\nwe when we run this from orchestrator\nthis one will not be deployed to\ndeployed it's very easy just click\npublish this one will be the new version\n1.02 so I can click next this one will\nbe the pro the parameter that we said\nbefore I can just click publish we now\npublished a new version this is how you\nwant to when you build new things in\nyour robots you can just publish it as a\nnew version so that's fine\nI go back here to go to orchestrator you\nwant to navigate to\ncloud.uipath.com this address up here\nthen I want to press enter and this will\ntake you to this Rampage you might have\nit open if you watch this video in one\ngo\nso then I'll click Orchestra\nin my workspace folder which you see\nhere that is a personal attended folder\nwe want to create a new folder where we\ncan use unattended robots so here I\nclick tenant\nI now click folders I'll click this plus\nhere and here I'll make a folder called\nanimations.nog I'll use the 10 inch\npackage feeds that is fine I'll click\ncreate\nthen I'll choose manage access\nyou want to manage your user usually\nit's the one with email in here's mine I\nclick this 3D here click edit\nno role selected go down here allow to\nbe automation user that's it click next\nclick next once more here you want to\nmake sure that this allow unattended\nrobots to run automation as this user is\nticked so if it looks like this make\nsure it's ticked we will go down here\nand use a specific Windows user account\nadd the credentials below\nso here to find the domain you'll go to\nthe start menu type in command prompt\nsometimes it will not get it\nautomatically from here that's why we\nfound it here here I'll just type in who\nam I again start menu CMD enter this\nwill give you this one this is our\ndomain\nlet me copy this one here we'll see copy\nit here the password that is your\nWindows password I put in mine\nnow you can click update\nthat's it let me just close this one\nhere now we go to machines\nand click these three dots edit machine\nadd an unattended license to this\nmachine I'll click update\nthen you want to go down to anesians and\nthen we want to assign this machine to\nthis folder so I click these three dots\nsettings assign machines\nthere it is Market leg update\nthat's it\nnow we can add our process\nso still in the anishin snog make sure\nyou click here and you go down here then\nyou want to click automations\nclick add a process\nhere we will find the process that we\ncreated the UI path beginner's course we\nhave the 1.02 that is the version that\nwe gave it\nhere I'll click next\nwe don't have any packages along with\nour robot so I'll just click next once\nmore that's it we just go with the\ndefault properties if we don't specify\nname it will just be called uipath\nbeginners I can click create\njust click close for now this is how it\nlooks when you go there so when you\nclick your folder you will find your\nprocesses in automation processes\nto run it as an unintended robot you can\nclick these three dots add a trigger\nhere you can schedule it that could be\nevery night at two o'clock or we can use\na queue that is when we add items to a\nqueue then we can kick off our robot in\ncase you want to learn about Q and A\nreframework that is the template that\nuipath uses when you want to scale\nrobots in for example a company then you\nshould click this video RP in the right\ncorner that will teach you everything\nit's an advanced video but it will take\nyou through each step so just like here\nanyway we will not use a scheduled robot\nfor this time we will just see that this\nworks so I click cancel here\nI can just kick things off here I can\nstart this little play here here you'll\nsee that the runtime type is unattended\nit will just take any account in any\nmachine that's fine we only have one so\nhere I will click Start then we are\nrunning our automation there you go you\nhave now created an unattended robot\nwasn't that easy\nand we don't want to see this\num\nto the end\nI will fast forward to the end just to\nshow you that we had this column right\nand then make sure you stick because we\nwill talk a lot about the best books and\nthe best uipath resources as this finish\nthere you go we have ran our unattended\nrobot let's also inspect the actual\nresults here and see that we formatted\nit very nicely so if I go down here now\nyou can see that the before column has\nbeen formatted nice we just change the\ntype argument I just visited my\nbookshelf here behind me here and here\nwith all my best uipath books let me go\nto room and these are books that if you\nwant to read if you like reading I like\nto take them to public transportation to\nthe beach when I travel you can learn so\nmuch from them let me go to room one by\none and there's a list if you want to\nbuy them Below in the description\nfirst of all the coding language in\nuipath that is visual basic.net this\nbook is the absolute best it will not\nonly teach you visual basic.net but also\nobject oriented programming\nit's written by Jesse Liberty one of my\nold time idols\nat some point you won't get certified in\nuipath this guide was enough to get you\nstarted you learned some advanced\nconcepts but you still need some if you\nwant to get certified this books hasn't\nit is a very nice egg to set a rundown\nof all the important things that you\nwant to focus on if you want to get\ncertified by the way this associate\ncertification is the first certification\nthat is the one that you want to take as\na beginner or maybe like you need to\nhave I think three months of experience\nI'll recommend then you want to go with\nthe advanced ones later on\nif you want to use intelligent document\nprocessing that is using AI to take data\nout of your documents this book is for\nyou this is not a beginner's book so\ndefinitely read it if you want to get\ninspired or want to go Advanced it is\ngreat because it's examples so you can\njust literally just open it open your\ncomputer and learn from it it also has a\nnice chapter about integrating chatbots\ninto uipath\nthe clean coder nothing to do with RPA\nand uipath but still the best book if\nyou should only buy one book it should\nbe this why it teach you the core of\nsoftware development principles and\nthese ones apply to RPA development as\nwell\nit will prepare your processes to the\nFuture you that means when you come back\nto your UI path flows you need to\nstructure them that was renaming then\ncommenting them documenting them to make\nsure that you can easily see what's\ngoing on and also the future colleague\nof you so that's the principle here SQL\nwe use that ton srpa developers we use\nit in Excel to make queries and we use\nit with databases\nas you remember and being an RPA\ndeveloper is a lot about taking data out\nof system a and transferring them to\nsystem B in our example we did it from\nExcel to a web page and back from the\nweb page to another Excel here we can\nalso use databases this book is it\nteaches you SQL I will say 10 minutes is\nvery optimistic I'll might say two days\nor something you'll learn all the basics\nand that's it with RPA development you\ndon't need to mask all these surrounding\nTechnologies you just need to have a\nbrief recognition of all of them like we\nhad on regex because you usually just\nneed the basics and if it's not enough\nyou can Google it stack overflow you can\ngo on the Discord the I love automation\nDiscord there's also a link down here or\nyou can ask a much more experienced\ndeveloper at your company\nthe intelligent automation book is\nwritten by Ian barking my friend and\nthis is not why I recommend this this is\na very good one where we take each Topic\nin the intelligent automation that is\ncomputer vision Big Data machine\nlearning all the things that we can\napply to make our robots thinking seeing\nand talking chatbots and these things is\nexplained in here it's not an advanced\nbook probably your mother can understand\nit and that's the strength of it it's\neasily read but it gives you a nice\nknowledge especially if you want to\ncrack uipath job interviews this book is\nfor you in the end there's also a use\ncase section where you can get\ninspiration\nthen we have my favorite RPA book that\nis the robotic process automation\nhandbook it's written by Tom toley\num it's not again not an advanced book\nbut it teaches you a lot about the\necosystem the pipeline the RPA pipeline\neverything you need to know to get a\nnice understanding about RPA there's\npractical part in this book as well I\nwould not recommend it that is outdated\nbut it's easily worth it just for\noverview here so the last book I have it\non my Kindle that is written by my\nfriend Aaron Kuma it's about supporting\nan administrating UI path ecosystems\nand it's a lot for the support people\nthe it UPS and the likes but it's also\nfor you that want to know more about the\ntechnical aspects of you\nI'm not giving it five stars because\nAaron is my friend but generally because\nI like this book again it's cheap and\nit's easily written the whole book list\nis in the video description below\nand I'll definitely recommend go check\nthat one out the best UI path resources\nthose ones are right here at YouTube and\nhere are my three favorites\ntutorial by mukeshkala mucus color is a\nUI path most valuable professional he is\nvery skilled he will teach you all the\nbest practices he make long videos you\ncan watch them like you watch this video\ndefinitely go check his channel out\nthe next one that is uipath with Diego\nis from Denmark like I am I don't know\nhim personally but he seems like a nice\nguy he make videos about Advanced UI\npath Concepts the final one that is this\nchannel make sure you subscribe to the\nchannel to get all my new RPA uipath\nvideos\nwith that said I want you to check my\nDiscord out here we Network and solve\nuipath problems with more than 5 000 RPA\ndevelopers it's totally free to join\ncheck this video there's an invitation\nfor you in the video and as a guide for\nyou to join\n",
