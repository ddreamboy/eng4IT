  "text": "let's unpack the concept of Federated\nlearning a method for training AI models\nthat is all about keeping your sensitive\ndata right where it should be with you\nnow ai applications like chat Bots\nrecommendation systems and spam filters\nthey're all very data hungry and they\nhave been fed tons of examples\nmountains of information which they use\nto learn their specific tasks to build\nan AI model\nnow normally in machine learning We\nGather all of this data from different\nsources and bring it to one place all of\nthis will reside\nin a central server and that's where the\nactual training of the model takes place\nFederated learning turns this process on\nits head instead of bringing the data to\nthe model we take the model to the data\nso here's how it works think every\ndevice like a smartphone or a laptop or\na server it has its own local version of\na model\nso each of these are reporting into\ntheir own model and this model learns\nfrom the data right there on the device\nitself now after the model has learned\nfrom the local data it sends only the\nmodel updates back to the central server\nnot the actual raw data so this all goes\nhere\nto the central server and then that\nserver Aggregates all of these updates\nfrom all the devices to create what is\ncalled the global\nmodel\nnow why bother with this level of\ndecentralization well this concept was\nfirst introduced by Google in 2016 at a\ntime when Global attention was focused\non the use and misuse of personal data\nconcerns about data privacy and security\nprompted the search for alternatives to\ntraditional centralized AI training\nmethods giving birth to Federated\nlearning so let's imagine a scenario\ninvolving a group of companies that want\nto collaborate on building a model to\npredict market trends but each company\nhas sensitive sales data they want to\nkeep private so each company has access\nto an initial Baseline predictive Global\nmodel here's our Global model up here\nand this resides in a central\nserver\nnow in their individual environments\neach company trains the instances of the\nmodel using their own sensitive sales\ndata so we have the global model here\nand then these individual models with\neach company and here is their sensitive\nsales data along the bottom and they're\ntweaking and refining their model based\non their unique data so the companies do\nnot share their sensitive sales data\ninstead they only share the updates they\nmade to the model now these updates they\ndon't contain any raw sales data but\nthey do reflect the insights gained from\nthe data the model updates are then sent\nback\nto the central server\nand here they're integrated into the\nglobal model now this iterative process\ncontinues with each company refining the\nmodel based on their private data and\nsharing only the model updates over time\nthis model becomes increasingly accurate\nat predicting market trends even though\nno company had to share their sensitive\ndata each Company benefits from the\ncollective intelligence of the group\nwhile maintaining their data privacy\nthat is the essence of Federated\nlearning allowing for Collaborative\nLearning from shared model updates while\nkeeping the actual data distributed and\nprivate\nnow we can think of Federated learning\nas coming in three flavors so there's\nhorizontal and horizontal Federated\nlearning describes the forecasting model\nexample we've just discussed where the\ndata sets were all similar in this case\nthe similarity was this was all sales\ndata\nnow another one is\ncalled\nvertical Federated learning so instead\nof using similar data sets we're dealing\nwith complementary data using movie and\nbook reviews for example to predict\nsomeone's music preferences\nand then the Third Kind is called\nFederated\ntransfer learning here we start with a\nmodel that's already been trained to do\none task and then adapt it to do\nsomething slightly different like like\nhow a pre-trained foundation model\ndesigned to perform a task like\ndetecting cars is trained on another\ndata set to do something else entirely\nlike identify cats now the use cases for\nFederated learning are far-reaching and\nimpactful just consider the healthcare\nindustry where Federated learning allows\nmedical institutions to collaboratively\ntrain their models on their sensitive\ndata without sharing the actual medical\nrecords or how financial institutions\ncan improve their fraud detection\nmechanisms and credit scoring systems\nwithout compromising on customer privacy\nhowever Federated learning is not\nwithout its challenges there is the risk\nof inference attacks where adversaries\nmay try to extract information about the\ndata from the shared model updates when\nwe put them up there now to counter this\nresearchers are looking into strategies\nlike secure multi-party computation to\nensure privacy by encrypting model\nupdates or by adding a degree of noise\nto the data to mislead potential\nattackers other challenges include\ncomputational efficiency because we do\nhave all of this work going on locally\nhere and maintaining transparency in\nmodel training and creating incentives\nfor truthful participation look in the\nend Federated learning offers a\npromising path towards a new generation\nof AI applications by addressing privacy\nconcerns and leveraging the power of\ndistributed computing\nFederated learning holds the potential\nto revolutionize how AI models are\ntrained\nif you have any questions please
