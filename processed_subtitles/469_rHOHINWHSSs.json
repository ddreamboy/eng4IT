  "text": "I just watched a video of a wedding\nphotographer explaining how these SD\ncard holders corrupted all of her\nwedding photos so let's talk about how\nto safely store all the photos that you\nshoot now to be clear it wasn't exactly\nthis case these cases that I'm using are\nactually rubber lined they come with\ndifferent inserts so you can swap them\nout like right now I've got CF Express B\nI've got SD cards and micro SD cards and\nI've got a few of them depending on what\nI've shot like these ones I think have\nsome data on them still that I haven't\nerased these guys should be fresh but\nyou you might realize I don't actually\nhave a lot of memory cards I've got two\nof these cases maybe you knowbe maybe a\ndozen two dozen memory cards at most but\nthe one that she was talking about in\nher video was actually one of these\nreally big ones that holds like 50 SD\ncards and it's foam lined and it has a\ncover and the problem that she had was\nthat when you put the SD cards in and\nout of to the foam because of the\nmaterial that the foam is made of it\nwould cause a static discharge to build\nup and then it would zap the memory\ncards and she would lose all of her data\nnow this actually happened to me many\nyears ago when I was still just a single\nmemory card shooter and at the time I\nwas using I was using Lexar memory cards\nin fact I think this was one of the ones\nthat I was using that that got corrupted\nwhich is one of the reasons why I don't\nreally use Lexar memory cards anymore\nnothing particularly bad about them but\nI just it gives me anxiety thinking\nabout me losing my data but another\nthing she said in the video was that she\nwon't erase the data on her SD cards\nuntil she's fully edited and delivered a\nproject now I know there are\nphotographers out there who do this who\nliterally have 30 40 50 memory cards\nwill double shoot meaning you know if\nyou have a camera that has two SD card\nslots you're using that as your for of\nbackup but but the problem is that SD\ncards aren't really a longterm storage\nsolution so I'm going to grab a a pen\nand paper\nhere so we've got pen and paper and a\nton of hard drives and and I'm going to\nillustrate what my data storage solution\nis and what I think the best option for\nyou is if you're looking to offload your\ncards but have a backup and then have an\nextra backup because we all need\nredundancies in case things\nfail step one when I bring my camera\nhome I will take the SD card one of the\nSD cards out of my camera and load that\nonto either a solid state drive that is\nattached externally or in my case I have\nan internal solid state drive that is a\n4 GB drive you can kind of think of it\nas my everyday working drive but the\nother SD card stays into my camera until\nthat process until all of those photos\nare\ntransferred step two for me is is an\nautomatic process so as much as possible\nI don't want to be copying and pasting\nthings manually I want processes to run\nin the background so what I have is I\nhave a very large regular hard drive so\na spinning disc drive that I have vhm\nwhich is like a backup software utility\nthat will run daily backups of that\nsolid state drive so the the hard drive\nitself is 16 terabytes whereas the solid\nstate drive is 4 TBT and what that\nallows me to do is have backuped like\nversioned backups of my solid state\ndrive so one problem you can encounter\nis is data corruption so you need\nbackups that you can go back and grab\nthings but also if you accidentally\ndelete something and you don't realize\nyou delete something the versioned\nbackups that are on that daily backup\nhard drive means I can go back for a\nweek or 2 weeks or however long and and\nrecover things in case I accidentally\ndelete something that I didn't mean to\ndelete step three this is where it gets\ncomplicated might need a separate color\nfor this hold\non step three is where it gets\ninteresting it's also automated but I\nhave cloud backup of both of these\ndrives I know I used red for a cloud it\ndoesn't make sense but I actually use a\nservice that's called back Blaze and I\nand I think it's one flat I can't\nremember exactly how much it is but it's\nlike $10 or $15 a month editor Anthony\nhere it is $9 a month and I actually\nfound out I have a referral link so not\nnot affiliated in any way but if you use\nit you'll get the first month for free\nso I'll put that down in the description\nfor you to check\nout it's basically like having another\nsubscription service but what allows you\nto do is automatically back up any hard\ndrives that are directly attached to\nyour computer so we would call that\ndirect attached storage as opposed to\nNAS which is network attached storage\nwhich we'll get there we'll get there in\njust a second actually hold on my uh my\ndoorbell just rang let me uh let me grab\n[Music]\nit I uh I actually don't know what's in\nthis package but uh we're about to find\nout I uh oh okay we got uh this is\nexciting it's photography\nrelated\nnope so that's some uh K KN andf ND\nfilters cuz there's a a solar eclipse\ncoming up in uh solar eclipse lunar\neclipse there's a a solar eclipse and\nwe're going to maybe capture some of it\nmaybe we'll see ND 10 m 10 million what\nis that ND 100,000 so like basically the\ndarkest ND filter you've ever seen in\nyour life oh my gosh it is so dark okay\nfor reference I I'm pointing it at my\nlight and no light is coming through ND\n100,000 that is insane play with these\nlater okay where were we so at this\npoint we have one solid state drive that\nwe're editing off of that is a you know\na fast solid state drive so that\nLightroom runs fast that is being backed\nup to a physical hard drive which is\nslower bigger less expensive on a per\nterabyte or per gigabyte basis and then\nboth of these are being backed up to an\noffline backup solution so that's a 1 2\n3 backup if that's all you had you would\nbe perfect but because I have a lot of\ndata I have a lot of video files I have\na lot of photo files sometimes these run\nout so sometimes I have multiple ssds\nkind of at this 0.1 position and that is\nwhere all of these come in so these are\nvarious Brands I have some of these\nWestern Digital ones which people tend\nto not like but the Samsung ones the t7\ndrives in the ruggedized form and the\nmore the thinner aluminum form these are\nwhat I put working projects on so if I\nhave a big video project that's maybe\nbigger than 4 GB or maybe I don't want\nit filling up my main Drive these I will\nuse just for a project so a wedding a\nbig YouTube thing maybe I have multiple\nphotos that I I want to organize but\nthis is not long-term storage these I\nwill still back up to something else\nwhich if I need more storage I will back\nup to my network storage and this is\nwhere everyone loses their mind because\nthis is where it it all becomes pretty\ncomplicated where's my marker so how do\nI how do I say this this is like step\nthree so that the cloud cloud is step\nthree okay I think I think this makes\nsense but this is effectively where my\nNas lives so when this gets full the\nOverflow makes it into here but the\nproblem that I mentioned is that back\nBlaze only backs up local storage unless\nchanging colors to different marker\nunless you get back Blaze B2 which is\nlike their their business their\nEnterprise solution that unfortunately\ndoes charge you a per gigabyte fee so in\nmy case because I have a lot of video\nfiles that wouldn't fit on a single hard\ndrive I have the nas which is set up in\nraid so there's redundancy there in\nterms of a hard drive failure but then\nthis is backed up to back blade so in\nthis case I have two copies I don't have\nthree copies anything that goes onto my\nNas is stuff that I probably don't need\nanymore so archived projects photos that\nare older than 3 years old University\nprojects all that is going to be on my\nNas so my recommendation if you're\nlooking for a simple stupid solution is\nto just implement the top half of this\nwhere either you have a solid state\ndrive for all your working stuff and\nthen another solid state drive so if you\nwanted to you could have like a like an\noffline disconnected copy of the the\nsame thing but then have a virtual\noff-site third copy in the cloud\nhonestly back Blaze not sponsored not\naffiliated with them in any way one of\nmy old co-workers told me about it he\nwas using it for all his like his photos\nand his videos and honestly it is it is\na solution that if you don't want to buy\nhundreds and hundreds of of SD cards and\nhave one of these massive like SD cards\nare expensive most people don't realize\nthat on a per gigabyte basis which is\nthe number you should be comparing your\nstorage solutions by is that SD cards\nespecially the super fast ones or the CF\nExpress cards like the one I showed you\nearlier like this prograde one which is\nabsolutely awesome super fast but also\nthis is like a $1,000 $1,200 memory card\nand you don't want to be using these as\nlong-term storage you're going to be\nmuch better off you know for the same\ncapacity actually for more capacity\nbuying one of these Samsung drives and\nbeing able to store or multiple projects\non it and probably have this one be\nfaster well maybe not faster not faster\nthan the CF Express card but probably a\nlittle bit more reliable since it's got\nthat waterproofing ruggedized look you\ncan take this throw this on your\nshelf and not worry about it but I'll\nlink to all that stuff to the memory\ncards to the drives that I use to the\nnas stuff that I recommend down in the\ndescription if you found any of this\nhelpful and you'd like me to go further\ninto memory cards and hard drives and\nall that sort of stuff for storing your\nphone and your video files let me know\ndown in the comments if you like this\nvideo give it a thumbs up and until the\nnext one go shoot\nphotos\n",
