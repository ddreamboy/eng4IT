  "text": "meet anne\nshe often shops from\nwww.shoppingcart.com\nshe has her information like email id\naddress and credit card details saved on\nthe website to enable a faster and\nhassle-free shopping experience the\nrequired information is stored in a\nserver\none day anne received an email which\nstated her eligibility for a special\ndiscount voucher from shoppingcart.com\nin order to receive the coupon code she\nwas asked to fill in her shopping\ncart.com account credentials\nthis didn't seem fishy to her at the\ntime as she thought it was just an\naccount verification step\nlittle did she realize the danger she\nwould be facing\nshe was knocked off her feet when a\nsubstantial amount of money was wiped\noff her account\nhow do you think this happened\nwell yes the email she received was fake\nanne's shoppingcart.com account\nwitnessed unauthorized access from a\nthird party this type of attack is known\nas a cyber attack and the person who\ncarries it out is called a hacker\ncould anna prevented this attack\nindeed she could have\nwith the help of cyber security\ncyber security involves techniques that\nhelp in securing various digital\ncomponents networks data and computer\nsystems from unauthorized digital access\nthere are multiple ways to implement\ncyber security depending on the kind of\nnetwork you are connected to and the\ntype of cyber attacks you are prone to\nso let's take a look at the various\ncyber attacks that anne could have been\nexposed to\none of the most common types of cyber\nattacks is a malware attack like trojan\nadware and spyware to name a few\nhad ann downloaded any suspicious\nattachments online her system could have\ngotten corrupted by certain malicious\nviruses embedded within the attachments\nnext is a phishing attack the type of\ncyber attack which ann experienced\nhere the hacker usually sends fraudulent\nemails which appear to be coming from a\nlegitimate source\nthis is done to install malware or to\nsteal sensitive data like credit card\ninformation and login credentials\nanother type of attack is the man in the\nmiddle attack\nhere the hacker gains access to the\ninformation path between ann's device\nand the website's server the hacker's\ncomputer takes over anne's ip address by\ndoing so the communication line between\nann and the website is secretly\nintercepted\nthis commonly happens with unsecured\nwi-fi networks and also through malware\npassword attack is one of the easiest\nways to hack a system\nhere anne's password could have been\ncracked by using either common passwords\nor trying all possible alphabetical\ncombinations\nto prevent future cyber attacks and\nsought to implement a few cyber security\npractices\nfirst she installed a firewall as the\nname suggests it is a virtual wall\nbetween anne's computer and the internet\nfirewalls filter the incoming and\noutgoing traffic from your device to\nsafeguard your network and they can\neither be software applications or\nhardware reinforcements\nsecondly and implemented honeypots just\nlike how flowers attract bees dummy\ncomputer systems called honeypots are\nused to attract attackers\nthese systems are made to look\nvulnerable in order to deceive attackers\nand this in turn defends the real system\nin addition to these she also decided to\nuse unique alphanumeric passwords\nantivirus software and started avoiding\nmails from unknown senders\nthat was ann's story\ncyber attacks are not just confined to\nindividuals but also to public and\nprivate organizations\nthe cyber attacks carried out in such\nplaces are more deadly and they result\nin colossal losses\nmotives of such attacks are many\nstarting from tampering with crucial\ndata to monetary gains\nlet's have a look at a few of the cyber\nattacks that companies are subjected to\nvarious public sector organizations and\nlarge corporations face the advanced\npersistent threat apt\nin this form of attack hackers gain\naccess to networks for a prolonged\nperiod in order to continuously gain\nconfidential information\ncompanies also witness the denial of\nservice attack where networks are\nflooded with traffic which in turn\nleaves legitimate service requests\nunattended a variant of this is the\ndistributed denial of service ddos\nattack when multiple systems are used to\nlaunch the attack\nwhen a hacker manipulates a standard sql\nquery in a database driven website it is\nknown as a sql injection attack by doing\nso hackers can view edit and delete\ntables from databases\namidst a plethora of cyber attacks it is\nindeed a challenge for organizations\nwith several networks and servers to\nensure complete security this is not an\neasy task and to help with this cyber\nsecurity professionals are hired to work\non identifying cyber threats and\nsecuring a company's network\nthere are multiple job roles in the\nfield of cyber security if hacking\nfascinates you then the role of an\nethical hacker is something to be\nexplored\nsuch professionals try to a network's\nvulnerabilities just like how a hacker\nwould do\nbut only to identify those\nvulnerabilities and resolve them for\nprotection against an actual cyber\nattack\nbut if you are looking to design robust\nsecurity structures then the role of a\nsecurity architect is more apt\na chief information security officer\nciso plays a crucial role in enterprise\nsecurity and is entrusted with the\noverall safety of the information in an\norganization\nso here's a question for you identify\nthe type of cyber attack where the\nhacker's system takes over the client's\nip address\na ddos attack\nb\nman in the middle attack\nc phishing attack\nd\npassword attack\ngive it a thought and leave your answers\nin the comments section below three\nlucky winners will receive amazon gift\nvouchers\nwith the increase in the production of\nglobal digital data it is anticipated\nthat cyber attacks will quadruple in the\nnear future organizations are going to\nneed cyber security professionals who\ncan prevent these attacks\na career in the field of cyber security\nis lucrative and a very smart decision\nfor professionals now\nso what are you waiting for get\ncertified with simply learn and become a\ncybersecurity expert\nif you enjoyed this video a
