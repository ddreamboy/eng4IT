Instead, cryptocurrencies, account \nbalances, and transactions exist on computers...  \na network of computers 🖧 using a blockchain \nor similar technological foundation. So what  \nis blockchain? ⛓️ Blockchain is just a fancy term \nthat describes a running ledger of transactions.  \nWithout losing sight of this video, if you would \nlike to learn more about blockchain and why it was  \ndeveloped, you can check out my video guide for \nbeginners by clicking on the link above 🖲️ ⬆ Nice,  \nback to wallets a cryptocurrency wallet has \nsoftware that creates and stores your private  \nand public Keys interacts with the blockchain \nmonitors your cryptocurrency balances and allows  \nyou to send and receive digital assets so to send \nreceive store and monitor your cryptocurrency  \nbalances and other digital assets like nfts you \nneed to use a cryptocurrency wallet and what's  \nfunny is we shouldn't really use the word wallet \nwhen talking about crypto because a wallet in  \nthe traditional sense makes us think of our cash \nactually physically inside of our wallet or our  \ncredit cards actually inside of our wallet while \na cryptocurrency wallet is more accurately a key  \nto access our phones because our cryptocurrencies \nand digital assets are not actually inside of our  \nwallets they are on the blockchain which is a \nrunning Ledger of transactions distributed all  \naround the world so in reality our crypto is \nbasically assigned to our wallet's private key  \nand our wallet gives us access to the crypto and \nthe ability to view our balances send and receive  \ncrypto stake it interact with smart contracts Etc \nawesome hello I'm cryptocasian in this video we  \nare going to explore how cryptocurrency wallets \nwork the different types of cryptocurrency wallets  \navailable on the market and why it's important to \nuse multiple cryptocurrency wallets to diversify  \nthe risks associated with investing in new \nspeculative technology let's hit it [Music]  \nplease be sure to check out our sponsors I \ntrust Capital Malwarebytes and tangent wallet  \ntrade cryptocurrencies tax-free within

it's the size of \na credit card multi-currency multi-chain and  \nit's by far the easiest Hardware wallet to set \nup and use on the market right now while also  \nbeing the most cost effective like starting at \naround forty four dollars using the link below  \nwith a special discount for us note that since the \nLedger Fiasco tantrum has been swamped so orders  \nhave been backed up for a few weeks so pre-order \none to get your spa in line for the next batch of  \nwallets scroll down and use links below to access \nthe correct and official sites as well as redeem  \nany special offers they have for us so how do \ncryptocurrency wallets work we are going to go  \nthrough a very simplified analogy to help us wrap \nour heads around around how cryptocurrency wallets  \nwork together please note this is not exactly how \nthe technology works it's just an analogy so a  \nsimplified way to understand how cryptocurrency \nwallets work is to consider how your traditional  \nonline banking applications work imagine your \nbank is the blockchain your bank account number  \nis the public key your crypto wallet is your \nonline banking app and your online banking app  \nlogin credentials are your private key so your \nbank records and tracks all the transactions  \ngoing to and from your bank account just like the \nblockchain records and tracks all the transactions  \ngoing to and from your public key using your \nonline banking app you are able to check the  \nbalance of your bank account and send or receive \ntransactions just like a cryptocurrency wallet  \nallows you to check your balances and send or \nreceive crypto however in order to log in to your  \nonline banking app you need to first type in your \nusername and password which is like using your  \nprivate key to access your cryptocurrency wallet a \npublic key is similar to your bank account number  \nin that if you provide anyone with your bank \naccount number they can send you funds keep in  \nmind that public keys are also commonly known as \nwallet addresses however having your bank account  \nnumber alone would not allow someone to take funds \nfrom your account this is also how a public key  \nworks people can send cryptocurrency to you using \nyour public key or public wallet address but they  \ncannot take funds from you using your public key \non the flip side giving your online banking app  \nlogin credentials to someone would allow them to \nsend funds from your bank account to somewhere  \nelse this is similar to a private key if you give \nsomeone your private key they can access your  \ncryptocurrency and send it somewhere else unlike \ntraditional banking if you give away your private  \nkey and your funds go missing you will likely \nnot be able to recover them this is why it's  \nso important to keep your private key private and \nbefore sending and receiving cryptocurr currency  \nyou must first make sure you are sending the same \ntype of currency to a wallet address or public  \nkey that supports that particular cryptocurrency \nfor example you can only send Bitcoin to bitcoin  \naddresses and you can only receive ether \nfrom either addresses and the simplest way  \nto understand why Bitcoin addresses only work with \nBitcoin ether only works on ethereum Solana only  \nworks on Solana Etc is to think of them like \nsoftware applications on Mac versus PC versus  \nLinux or like Apple versus Android so they are \njust different Tech foundations using different  \ncode which is why Apple apps can't be installed on \nAndroid devices there has to be an Android version  \nof the app to be supported on Android cool so if \nyou have another person's public key or address  \nyou can easily send them some corresponding \ncryptocurrency and vice versa and when  \ncryptocurrencies are sent or received no actual \nphysical or digital exchange occurs between the  \nwallets remember cryptocurrency wallets interact \nwith the blockchain and the blockchain is where  \nall cryptocurrency transactions are logged and \nit's also where balances are tracked so just to  \nrecap a cryptocurrency wallet has software that \ninteracts with the blockchain stores your public  \nand private Keys monitors your cryptocurrency \nbalances and allows you to send and receive  \ncryptocurrency nice what are the different types \nof cryptocurrency wallets there are many different  \ntypes of cryptocurrency wallets to choose from and \neach of them have their own pros and cons let's  \nbreak down crypto wallets into two categories \nhot and cold a hot wallet creates and stores  \nyour private Keys online while cold wallets create \nand store your private Keys offline so examples of  \nhot law include desktop or mobile app software \nthese wallets operate on your computers and cell  \nphones which are connected to the internet so \nwhen you set up these wallets your private key is  \ngenerated on a hot device which just means it's \nconnected to the internet which could be more  \nvulnerable to being compromised especially with \nAI scamming tactics becoming more sophisticated  \nEtc however by far the least secure way to store \nlarge investments in cryptocurrency for the long  \nterm is on an exchange why well first of all it's \nonline therefore hot therefore more vulnerable to  \nhacks and on top of it cryptocurrency exchanges \nare huge targets for hackers since obviously  \nthere's a ton of potential crypto that can be \nstolen with any wallet we manage on our own  \na hacker has no idea how much potential funds \nthere are to steal while crypto exchanges are  \na guaranteed Gold Mine of swords and second of \nall due to lack of transparency and regulation  \nthere is an artificial supply of crypto meeting \nreal demand because exchanges lend out crypto  \nyou stake infinitely between other people and \nexchanges which basically means that one ether  \nyou are looking at on your account could also be \nthe same either five other people on The Exchange  \nare looking at meaning cryptocurrency exchanges \ndon't actually have all the crypto backed one to  \none for all of their customers so if there was a \nmassive run on exchanges where everyone wanted to  \nmove their Bitcoin and ether to their own wallet \nthere would not be enough to go around like we saw  \nwith FTX there are also some bad players out there \ngambling with our funds we leave on the exchange  \nand can go bust and third of all as we see with \ncoinbase regulatory bodies like the SEC can go  \nafter them sue them demonetize them by forcing \nthem to de-list a significant amount of crypto  \nwhich would destroy their profits which puts \nthem at risk of going under as we've discussed  \nat length on the channel exchanges need to be used \nas a tool to exchange Fiat for crypto crypto for  \ncrypto and crypto to Fiat not for storing crypto \nInvestments we need to be transferring any crypto  \nwe want to exchange to them and when we are done \ntransferring our crypto back to our own wallets  \nsweet now let's learn about the safest most ideal \nway to store significant amounts of cryptocurrency  \nfor the long term cold wallets cold wallets are \nalso known as Hardware wallets Hardware wallets  \nare designed to safely create and store your \nprivate key offline and when sending receiving or  \nmanaging funds you will need to use the hardware \nwallet device and go through more security steps  \nin general which makes your funds less vulnerable \nto theft by creating and storing private keys  \nwith Hardware wallets your funds are safer from \nhackers and other potential security issues that  \nhot software wallets are more likely to experience \nso store your cryptocurrency on a hardware wallet  \nis the safest most secure way to manage your \nfunds so if you scroll down to the description  \narea below you can access the correct and official \nsite of my recommended Hardware wallets note there  \nare two important things you need to know about \nbuying a hardware wallet first only buy Hardware  \nwallets from the real manufacturer do not buy used \nHardware wallets and do not buy them from other  \nother companies or individuals this is because \nhackers may buy a hardware wallet tamper with  \nthe software and resell the Hacked device to steal \nyour phone and second as with all crypto related  \nactivities make sure you double and triple \ncheck the URL you are accessing to buy the  \nhardware wallet make sure the address is correct \nand that it has an SSL or secure sockets layer  \nwhich uses the https protocol instead of HTTP \nthere are a ton of phishing scams online that  \nwill pretend to be the real website you intend \nto access and if you access a fake website you  \nmay lose your funds or receive a hacked wallet so \nagain if you're interested in my recommendations  \nusing the links below get you where you want to \ngo safely all while supporting the channel since  \nLedger's announcement of their recover Services \nsoftware update to their devices tangent wallet  \nan alternative that never reveals our private key \nor seed to anyone has been blowing up like I said  \nthere is a wait for the next batch of wallets so \nmake sure to get your spa online earlier rather  \nthan later it looks like a credit card uses \nthe highest standard of security among crypto  \nwallets known as eal 6 Plus which is a level \nof protection used by NASA and in passports the  \nsource code for tangem's mobile app is all open \nand available for review on their GitHub which is  \nimportant for full transparency to ensure there \nare no backdoors built in and that funds can be  \naccessed if the company shut down for any reason \ninstead of a seed phrase as the only way to back  \nup our crypto wallets backup copies of the wallet \nare created and used on other tantrum cards that  \nwe encrypt with our own unique access code we \ncreate breach card also note the pricing for this  \ncryptocurrency Hardware device is much cheaper and \naffordable than other ones starting at just over  \nforty dollars with free shipping using our promo \ncode this is a plus for any beginners just getting  \nstarted or anyone who is looking to onboard \nfriends and family into crypto with a simple  \neasy to use secure self-custody wallet so scroll \ndown and use link below to access tangents correct  \nand official site as well as redeem any special \noffers they have for us cool and we can check out  \nthe step-by-step Tanger wallet setup guide to get \na better idea about how tangent wallet creates and  \nprotects our private Keys differently than Ledger \ntrezor and other wallets that use seed phrases by  \nclicking on the link above since the vast majority \nof cryptocurrency wallets use seed phrases to back  \nup our wallets and access our phones at large \nwhile we wait for the next batch of tangent  \nwallets or wait for whatever Hardware wallet \nwe've chosen to go with like Ledger treasure  \nBC Vault to arrive let's create our own hot wallet \ntogether using a mobile app called trust wallet it  \ntransfers some crypto to it get ready we are about \nto have the Eureka moment we've all been waiting  \nfor about what happens if your phone dies or if \nyour Hardware wallet breaks or if it's stolen  \nEtc when it uses a seed phrase as backups let's \nin it how to set up your own crypto wallet in  \nthis video we are going to set up the trust wallet \ntogether on our mobile device step by step open  \nthe app store on your phone and type in trust \nwallet and click download and install it then  \nopen the app tap on create new wallet tap to check \nthe box agreeing to the terms of service next we  \nare going to create a passcode to add an extra \nlayer of security when using the app then confirm  \nthe passcode by entering it again and now we are \ngoing to back up our secret phrase which is the  \nmaster key to your wallet and anyone that has it \ncan access your crypto so never share it which is  \nwhy I recommend backing it up manually versus to \nyour iCloud as it could pose more vulnerabilities  \nif your iCloud is compromised so we are going to \ntap backup manually on the next screen the app  \ngives us more information stating this secret \nphrase is the master key to your wallet tap on  \nall check boxes to confirm that you understand the \nimportance of your seed phrase tap the first box  \nthat read if I lose my secret phrase my funds will \nbe lost forever tap the second box that reads if  \nI expose or share my secret phrase to anyone my \nfunds can get stolen and tap the third box that  \nreads trust wallet support will never reach out to \nask for it then tap continue and here are the 12  \nwords you need to write down in order and secure \nto protect any crypto use into it after these next  \nfew steps it will become clear how our crypto is \non the blockchain and how private keys or recovery  \nphrases are merely keys to access our funds that \nare on the blockchain and how anyone with these  \nwords can steal all of your funds if you do not \nproperly secure these words these 12 words are  \nthe keys to your wallet literally by memorizing \nthese 12 words you can carry access to hundreds  \nand thousands millions and billions of dollars \nworth of crypto right here in your brain stay  \ntuned for the end of this video when I show you \nhow I can gain access to your funds using these  \n12 words anytime and anywhere but regardless of \nwhether you lose this particular phone or not it's  \nfor this reason I do not recommend backing this \nphrase up to iCloud which is something that could  \nalso be hacked I don't recommend ever storing your \nwallet private key on any device connected to the  \ninternet password manager or similar so don't \ntake a screenshot of it or picture the best way  \nis using good old-fashioned pen and paper for now \nsecuring it in multiple geographical locations in  \ncase of a fire flood or similar in this video \nwe are just doing a simple short-term solution  \nfor storing our own crypto together to get it off \nof exchanges until we can get a hardware wallet  \nso for now like I said I recommend writing \nyour secret phrase down on paper and storing  \nit somewhere extremely secure like a safe or \ninconspicuous like into your house in a book  \non a shelf or similar cool next we need to verify \nthe secret phrase by tapping the words to put them  \nnext to each other in the correct order and we \nare done we have officially created our very own  \nself-custody crypto wallet where we can completely \nown and control our digital assets using the trust  \nwallet we can buy crypto deposit and store nfts \nand deposit crypto tap deposit now let's say  \nwe have some ether we can send to our new trust \nWallet tap ethereum and from here we can scan the  \nQR code or copy the address for our first example \nto show you how easy it is to use tangent wallet  \nwe are going to send some ether from tangent \nwallet to trustwallet so I'm going to tap the  \ncopy button to copy our trust ether address then \nI'm going to open tangem's mobile app and tap scan  \ncard then using my physical tangent Hardware \nWallet card I'm going to tap it to my phone  \nthen enter my access code then tap the card again \nand here we are at our tangent wallet dashboard  \nI'm going to tap ethereum TAPS in paste The Ether \ntrust wallet address into the address field enter  \n100 worth of ether looks like the network fee to \nprocess the transaction is about two dollars make  \nsure everything looks good and tap send to verify \nthe transaction I'm going to enter my access code  \nagain tap my tantrum card to my phone and success \nthe transaction has been signed and sent to the  \nblockchain so now if we open our trust Wallet \napp enter our passcode hear almost instantly on  \nthe trust wallet dashboard we see the hundred \ndollars worth of ether has a wrap amazing next  \nhere comes the part that will probably be a \nlot easier than you think transferring your  \ncrypto from The Exchange to your new self-custody \nmobile wallet for Simplicity I'm going to assume  \nyour crypto is on coinbase in this guide however \nno matter which exchange you use you should be  \nable to log in choose a send function and follow \nsimilar steps to move your crypto on your computer  \nor phone log into your Exchange in this guide \nI'm accessing The coinbase Exchange app on a  \nmobile device on the coinbase mobile app dashboard \nTAPS in let's say we want to send Bitcoin from The  \nExchange to our trust wallet so tap Bitcoin and \non the Trust app tap Bitcoin to see the QR code or  \nor copy the address in this video we are scanning \nthe QR code like so then tap continue enter the  \nemail of Bitcoin to send I always recommend that \nbeginners and seasoned crypto investors alike  \nsend a small amount to a new wallet first to make \nsure everything goes smoothly before sending large  \namounts in this video we are going to send 100 \nworth tax preview make sure everything looks good  \nthe fee will be about 73 cents it'll take about 30 \nminutes to complete the transfer tap send now if  \nyou have 2fa setup enter the six digit code from \nyour authenticator app and it's been successfully  \nsent tap done and we can see after a few minutes \nthe Bitcoin has arrived to our trust wallet  \nbrilliant here we are we now are in complete \ncontrol of our Bitcoin and ether where it's  \nstored on the blockchain and we are the only ones \nwith keys to access it rather than it merely being  \nan amorphous pool of Bitcoin controlled by the \nexchange so secure your secret phrase and repeat  \nthese steps to transfer all of your cryptocurrency \ncurrency on exchanges you're looking to hold for  \nthe long term to your new mobile wallet that \nis until your Hardware wallet arrives now for  \nthe Eureka oh my God I finally get it moment as it \nrelates to secret phrases and access to our crypto  \nlet's just say I come across your 12 words and \njust your 12 words not your phone not your address  \nor passwords or anything that has any connection \nwith you to it at all if I found a piece of paper  \nin the middle of the street with these 12 words \nand I wanted to take your crypto this is how it  \ncan be done you can pretty much use almost any \nother mobile crypto Wallet app to do this quickly  \nin this example I'm going to download another \ncrypto mobile app called Exodus next I'm going  \nto open the app but instead of choosing to create \na wallet I'm going to select I have a wallet and  \non the restore wallet screen I'm going to select \nsecret phrase and start typing in the 12 words on  \nthis paper I randomly found on the street note \nthat while it's like Ledger and trezor create  \n24 words and you can do the same exact thing if I \nfound your 24 word Ledger private key I can do the  \nsame exact thing and take all of your funds cool \nokay so all 12 words are entered and now I'm going  \nto tap continue and restart to restore this wallet \nafter a minute or so we've been notified that  \nthe restore was successful in voila here is the \nhundred dollars of Bitcoin and hundred dollars of  \nether we sent to our new trust wallet but since we \ndidn't secure our 12 words I was able to download  \nanother crypto Wallet app and restore access \nto it using just the 12 words from here I can  \neasily send the funds elsewhere to another wallet \nI control and you do not effectively stealing all  \nof your crypto and digital assets that fast and \nthat simple check it out here's the Bitcoin and  \nit's gone and here's the ether and it's also gone \nthe next time we open our trust wallet we set up  \nbut did not secure properly we can see our balance \nis zero that's why it's so important to guard your  \nprivate key recovery phrase 12 or 24 words \nwhatever you've got and to consider getting a  \nhorror wallet that generates a private key offline \nand stores it offline for maximum security or we  \ncan also consider different wallets that do not \nuse seed phrases that can easily be stolen or  \nin some cases we can be socially engineered or \ntricked by scammers that pretend to be Ledger  \nor similar and try to have us type in our seed \nphrases into a big website or by having us text  \nthem or email them our seed phrase then by similar \nsteps we just went through using the words to  \ndrain your wallet wallets that use alternative \nways to secure crypto wallet private keys are  \nBC Vault and tangent wallet for example with the \ntangip wallet the private keys are actually never  \nexposed to anyone ever so if I found your tandem \nwallet randomly on the street and downloaded the  \ntangent Wallet app and scan the card the the \nrequirement of an access code prevents me from  \naccessing your crypto and sending it elsewhere \nto steal it at the end of the day with this new  \nspeculative technology it's important to \ndiversify where we store our crypto long  \nterm by using several different types of wallets \nso we don't experience a total loss if something  \nhappened to Ledger vs trust wallet versus BC Vault \nor tangent so be sure to scroll down and use the  \nlinks below to access the corrected official \nsites for any wallet you're interested in using  \nto secure your crypto Investments awesome if \nyou would like to watch a step-by-step video  \nguide all about tangent wallet
