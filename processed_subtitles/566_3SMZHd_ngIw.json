  "text": "hey everyone welcome to this session by\nsimply learn in this video we dive\ndeeper into rpa by creating and\nexecuting a simple bot\nso let's go ahead and look at what's in\nstore for us\nwe will cover topics like why rpa what\nis rpa what is not rpa how does rpa work\nrpa software tools what is ui path\nuipath components and a simple hands-on\ndemo so why exactly rpa now consider a\ntech support unit that addresses\nhundreds of queries on the daily the job\nis to mainly guide the customer to the\nappropriate tech unit to help resolve\nthe issues now most of their work that\nthey do is basically strenuous\nrepetitive and monotonous and not to\nmention time consuming now rpa can\ndiminish the workload of the human help\ndesk by automating straightforward and\ndefinitive tasks complex administrative\ntasks like fault remediation and regular\ndiagnostics can also be automated\nall in all rpa reduces human workload\nand implements tasks effectively and\nefficiently so moving on to the most\nimportant question what exactly is rpa\nrobotic process automation is the use of\nsoftware with artificial intelligence\nand machine learning capabilities to\nhandle high volume repetitive tasks that\npreviously required humans to perform\nnow some of these tasks could be\naddressing queries making complex\ncalculations maintenance of records or\neven maintenance of transactions\nnow to give you a better understanding\nlet's look at an example consider the\nonboarding of a recruit into an i.t\ncompany data collection is a crucial\npart of the process with that\ninformation a new user account email\naddress and access rights are generated\nwith robotic process automation the user\naccount can automatically activate a\ntemplate for the onboarding workflow now\nrpa can assess prepare create new joiny\ndata initiate mailing of offer letters\nand streamline the entire information\nacross the systems so tasks that\npreviously required asked to perform can\nnow be done within a few seconds with\nthe help of rpa\nstats show that rpa automation and\naccuracy can be increased to 100 percent\nand the processing speed can be made 10\ntimes faster rpa tools like uipath and\nblue prism among others are now being\ndeployed at top it firms\nso when you hear the term robotic in rpa\nit's ledger to assume that it involves\nrobots that perform human tasks while\nthis is partially true there are certain\nmisconceptions so what are they so what\nis not rpa\nrpa bots are not humanoid robots they do\nnot have a physical form unlike robots\nlike sophia these bots cannot entirely\nreplace humans they are still controlled\nand monitored by us and lastly they do\nnot possess human cognitive skills they\nlack logical thinking and cannot make\ndecisions on their own which by\nextension makes them incapable of\nreplacing humans\nnow that we have a clear understanding\nof what rpa is and what it's not you\nmust be wondering how it works so let's\nhave a closer look at its working\nthe first step towards any approach is\nplanning in this stage the processes to\nbe automated are defined which includes\nidentifying the test objects finalizing\nan implementation approach and defining\na clear roadmap for the rpa\nimplementation next we have design and\ndevelopment\nas the name suggests in this phase you\nstart developing the automation\nworkflows as per the agreed plan third\nis deployment and testing this phase\ntypically includes the execution of the\nbots now any expected outages are to be\ntaken care of during the deployment to\nensure accurate functioning testing of\nthese bots for bugs and errors is\ncrucial\nlastly is support and maintenance now\nproviding constant support helps in\nidentifying and rectifying the errors\nbetter\nmoving on we have rpa software tools now\nthese tools typically help develop and\nexecute bots some of the rpa tools are\nuipath blue prism automation anywhere\nwork fusion among others in this\ntutorial we will execute a bot using the\nuipath tool\nbefore executing a demo test case let's\ngo ahead and understand what uipath is\nand its interface\nuipath is basically an advanced rpa tool\nwhich allows you to create control and\nexecute front office and back office\nbots with the help of visual templates\nand diagrams now it also provides\nend-to-end automation calling it hyper\nautomation uipath offers three different\nproduct suites first up we have ui path\nstudio now it is a platform to create\nautomation bots it encompasses hundreds\nof activity templates and ready-made\ncomponents to drag and drop now some of\nits features include gui dashboard which\nbasically consists of activities like\nsend email display message and so on it\noffers different types of recorders to\nrecord user actions on multiple\nplatforms it provides logging and\nexceptional handling it also has\nreusable components now the user can\ncreate these reusable components to\npublish them together as libraries the\nnext product suite is uipath robot now\nthey run automation bots that are\ncreated using uipath studio there are\ndifferent types of robots firstly we\nhave the attended robots now these\nrobots work with you to speed up the\nservice desk and the help desk it's\nbasically used in activities where human\ninvolvement is key next up we have\nunattended robots now they operate\nwithout the human touch maximizing the\ncost and performance benefits for any\nvariety of back office tasks the third\nproduct suite is the orchestrator now it\nis a centralized robot management\ndashboard where you can easily deploy\nsecure and manage your ui path robots at\nscale now here's the course of action\nthe first step is that the user creates\na bot next the user has to save this\nproject and which is later used as a\nprocess now once the process is created\nit is assigned to a specific robot to\nexecute it this collectively constitutes\na job and all of which is taken care of\nby the uipath orchestrator now let's\nunderstand the uipath interface in brief\nfirst up we have the recorder now as the\nname suggests this component allows the\nuser to record all user actions such as\nnavigations clicks etc next up is\nscraping now it involves two components\none is the screen scraping which is the\nprogrammatic collection of visual data\nand the other one is data scraping which\nis the extraction of structured data\nfrom an application user events now all\nmouse clicks and key strokes given by\nthe user as input are recorded using\nthis feature lastly we have variables\nnow variables are used primarily for\nusing certain features now these\nvariables hold different types of data\nand can change over time all right now\nthat we have a fair understanding of ui\npath let's go ahead and execute a simple\ntest case so here's what we're going to\nbe doing first we extract information\nabout books on the website that is\ngoodreads.com so what information are we\nextracting so we're going to be\nextracting the names and the authors of\nthe new released books then this\ninformation is going to be stored in an\nexcel sheet and this excel sheet is\ngoing to be sent over an email so let's\ngo ahead and execute the test case all\nright so let's go ahead and open ui path\nstudio and here\nyou go and click on new process in the\ntop right corner\nall right and provide a name for it say\nrpa\nand i say create\nso now this is going to create a\nworkspace for you this might take up a\nfew seconds\nand this is what the typical uipath\nstudio interface looks like so moving\nahead we need to create a sequence of\nactivities so for that let's go ahead\nand say new sequence to the top left\ncorner and provide a name for it i\nchoose to keep it sequence so i say\ncreate\nbut what exactly is a sequence now\nsequence is a set of activities so all\nthe activities mentioned in a sequence\nare executed in the same order all right\nso now in our use case we are going to\nbe scraping data from the goodreads.com\nwebsite right okay so now we'll have to\nnavigate to the goodreads.com website\nand i've opened it in my browser\nso here we've navigated to the most\npopular books published in march 2020 so\nnow i have to extract data from this\nright i need\ntwo fields basically i need the name\nof the book and the author\nall right so what we're going to do is\nwe go back to uipath studio and click on\ndata scraping so go ahead and click on\ndata scraping\nand here it says open your browser or\napplication and wherever you want to\nextract your data from and then we click\non next and then click on the field that\nyou want to select\nso i say next and here i want just the\nname right so i click on the name\nand it says you selected an entire table\ncell would you like to extract the data\nfrom the whole table no i just want the\nname of the table right so i say no\nand now the next thing you need to do is\nyou have to create a pattern the tool\nneeds to understand what exactly you are\nextracting so what we do is we have to\ncreate a pattern\nto do that we have to select a second\nelement so i say next again\nand i click on the second name here i\nsay click and now the name of the column\nthat i want to give so i say\nbooks and i say next\nnow so this is how it's going to look\nthis is the data preview\nright so next we need the name of the\nauthor so i say extract correlated data\nhere\nso go ahead and click on that\nand now i need the name so i say i click\non sarah j maas\nand again to create a pattern i need to\nselect another element so i say next and\nclick on the next name of the author so\ni click on this\nand i\ngive the name author for this column all\nright so i click on next\nokay so this is how it's going to look\nso after this i say finish\nall right so now it's going to ask me if\ndata is spanning across multiple pages\nnow in our case if you look at this\npage\ndata is not spanning across multiple\npages say suppose you had one two three\nfour five saying there are more books\nahead then that would be data spanning\nacross multiple pages so that is not the\ncase here so i say no in our case\nand that is it\nso we have scraped our data from the\nwebsite okay so now that we're done with\ndata scraping the information that has\nbeen extracted has to be saved in a csv\nfile\nso for that you have to create the file\nso go to your activities and say write\ncsv\nall right so just drag and drop\nthe activity here\nnow it asks for two fields right so the\nfirst one is a target field where the\ninformation is stored so provide a name\nfor it for that let's go ahead and\nbrowse it\nand\nin my case\ni create a document say demo\none\nunderscore rpa\nand save it\nall right and the next field is a write\nfrom field now the information that\nyou're storing in the csv file is\nbasically the output of data scraping so\nthat is all the information from the\ndata scripting event is stored in an\noutput variable so click on that and\nhere you see you have an output variable\nso copy the output variable control c\nand then paste it here\nall right now save the file and now\nlet's execute it to see if it\nsuccessfully works\nso\ngo ahead and click on play\nso all right it's completed the\nexecution so let's go ahead and check\nif it has completed the execution\ncorrectly so i go back to my documents\nui path and we have demo one underscore\nrpa\nopen that\nand\nhere we go\nwe have the name of the author\nand the book all right so this works\ncompletely fine\nokay so the next step in our use case is\nto attach the csv file and send over an\nemail\nnow for that you have to provide your\ncredentials that is your email id and\nthe password now these credentials are\nalso used multiple times across the test\ncase so instead of specifying it every\ntime we can create two variables right\none for the email id and one for the\npassword so for that click on variables\nhere\nand say create variable\nand\nokay we have one already here so let's\ncall it email\nand the other one\nis called\npassword\nso go ahead and provide your credentials\nso i provide my email id\nand then my password\nokay and then save it\nall right now we have to attach this csv\nfile and send over an email right for\nthat we have an activity\ncalled send smtp mail message\nso go ahead and drag and drop it here\nand now it has three fields it has the\ntwo field the subject field and the body\nfield right so 2 is where you provide\nthe email id\nso here i just say email because i've\nalready defined a variable the next is\nthe subject so i say\nattachment\nand say the body i'll keep it simple and\nsay pfa okay now we have to attach the\nfile right so click on attach files and\nhere we have to provide the path to the\nfile so go back to the place where\nyou've saved your csv file and\ncopy the path\nand paste it here\nas an expression and at the end you\nprovide the name of the file so it was\ndemo one underscore rpa dot csv\nokay so now go ahead click on ok\nnow we have a lot of other fields to\nprovide here as well\nso here\nwe have\nthe port field now the smtp port that\nwe're using is number 465 so go ahead\nand provide that\nand the server\nis basically smtp.gmail.com\nall right and again we have to provide\nthe email id that is just email\nand this is just\npassword\nand then\ntwo is also provided already and the\nsender is again me so i say\nemail again and the password is again\npassword\nall right\nso now save it\nokay and as you can see\nthere are no errors\nthat means it's good to go\nokay so let's go ahead and execute this\nand see if it executes successfully so\ngo ahead and execute it\nall right so it has successfully\nfinished its execution so now let's go\nto my gmail account and see if i've\nreceived an email and yes i have\nso go ahead and click on that\nand here\ni download the file and see if it's\nappropriately sent and here we go so\nhere we go we have the name of the book\nand the author\nokay so with this we've successfully\nimplemented an rpa bot for email\nautomation now uipath also offers so\nmany features that you can play around\nwith to create more advanced rpa bots so\ni hope you found this video
