  "text": "all right bitcoin blockchain dogecoin\nethereum nfts\neveryone is talking about\ncryptocurrencies right now but\ngood lord what does all of it mean so\nwelcome to the one video that will take\nyou from crypto noob\nto cryptogenius i'm going to tell you\nwhat it is why it keeps becoming more\nimportant\nwhat i've actually invested in myself\nand the dark side of it\nokay so when society was in its early\nstages there was no such thing as money\nwe'll call this stage one the only way\nto buy something off someone\nwas to go up to them and be like oh i\nreally like your horse\ni'll trade you my cat for it sorry milo\ni never trade you but the issue with a\nsystem like that is that\neven though you might be perfectly happy\nto give up your horse you just\nmight not want a cat so that trade will\nnever happen but that's where currency\ncame in\nstage two coins which because they were\nmade of precious materials like gold and\nsilver\neveryone just accepted that they were\nworth something you've heard of the\nbritish pound right\nwell the reason they're called pounds is\nbecause one pound literally just used to\nbe\none pound of silver and so all of a\nsudden in a trade\nit doesn't matter if you don't want my\ncat as long as i have coins\nwe can still trade for your horse even\nif you have no use at all for the silver\nbecause it's a precious material you\nhave that reassurance that\nyou can take that coin give it to\nsomeone else and trade for something\nthat you do want\nconvenient right but then this evolved\nto stage three as banks became\nestablished and governments had control\nwe realized that as long as there was\ntrust in the system we could move away\nfrom needing to carry blocks of precious\nmetal\ntowards something even more convenient\npaper money\nit does the same thing but now the money\ndoesn't have value because it's made of\npure silver\nit just has value because the government\nsays it has value\nlike this 10 pound note here in the uk\nthe note itself is just made of\nwell it's actually made of plastic they\nchanged it recently because it's more\ndurable but if you look closely you can\nsee that all this actually is is the\nbank of england promising that they will\npay the bearer of this note 10 pounds\nreally this is just a receipt a kind of\nproof that you own a certain amount of\nmoney\nbut as technologies improved even\nfurther we found even more convenient\nways of storing and trading our stuff\nwe're now in what i would call stage\nfour where more people than ever are\nbuying things online and using credit\ncards and really when you're at that\nstage\nwe don't see our money anymore it's not\nabout coins or notes or\ncats it's just entries on a spreadsheet\nlike when i buy a music album from\namazon all that's happening is that my\nbank adds an entry in my spreadsheet\nthat says aaron now has ten dollars less\nand then amazon's bank adds an entry\nthat says\nthey have ten dollars more so the reason\ni've given you this entire intro\nis to give you context on where\ncryptocurrency sits it's seen by many\npeople\nas the most convenient era of exchange\never\nstage five the way to think about a\ncryptocurrency is that\nit's 100 virtual i know the logo for\nbitcoin kind of looks like a physical\ncoin\nit really is a bit coin now but with\ncrypto there is no gold there is no\nsilver there is no paper\nit really is just the transfer of\ndigital assets\nthe core concept is exactly the same\nthink of them as literally just running\nspreadsheets of who's paid what to who\nbut instead of multiple banks keeping\ntheir own separate records with crypto\nthere is just one\nenormous spreadsheet of every\ntransaction made using that currency\nand this is called a ledger okay we all\nhave a good spreadsheet but\nwhat's all the fuss about why is\neveryone going crypto crazy\nwell there are some distinct advantages\nto a currency system like this\none it's decentralized which means that\nwhile every transaction of a given\ncryptocurrency is\nall recorded on the same ledger there\nare many many copies of that ledger\nand anyone who is a part of the network\nhas one you might have heard of\ncryptocurrency mining\nor bitcoin mining well all that is is\nsomeone who set up a computer to crunch\nthrough transactions\non their copy of this ledger or\nspreadsheet there are already about a\nmillion bitcoin miners around the world\nand bitcoin is just one type of\ncryptocurrency\nthe reason they're doing it well if you\ndedicate your computer's power to mining\nsay bitcoin then you will earn some\nbitcoin as compensation\nso the result of this is that if i go\ninto a store and spend five bitcoins on\nsomething\nthen instead of just checking with one\nbank's records the shop instead checks\nwith every single computer on this\nnetwork if i have enough\nand assuming i do each computer will\ngive the go-ahead\nand then every single one will update\ntheir records independently\nso because you end up having this many\ncopies of exactly the same ledger\nit becomes very easy to tell if anyone's\ntrying anything fishy\ndid you who bought this\nlike if i try to hack into someone's\ncomputer that's on the network and\ngive myself more money by adjusting\nfigures on their copy of the ledger\nit's not going to get through the system\nwill realize that 99.9\nof the copies on the ledger are saying\none thing but one of them is saying\nsomething else\nso must have been tampered with there's\nvery clear organization to the system\nand i think people believe in it because\nthey see the future as\nopen traceable transactions much more so\nthan having like some bits of the record\nover here and\nother bits over there and i know it\nseems complex at this point but\nas we go through this i think you'll\nrealize that for a lot of people in a\nway\nit's simpler there are plenty of areas\nin the world that have internet access\nwhich is\nall you'd need for crypto but don't have\naccess to traditional banks which\nrequire a lot of paperwork\nand documentation well two and i've kind\nof implied this already but\nthe main perk of crypto is that you\ndon't need banks anymore\nbecause everything is stored by the\npeople on this ledger\nyou can make international payments\nalmost instantly instead of it taking\nhalf a day\nwith no spending limits plus you don't\nneed to worry about exchange rates you\ndon't need to worry about interest rates\nand\neven transaction fees are close to zero\nfor\nsome cryptocurrencies that is but this\nis where the real fun begins\ni'm fine at parties i promise the reason\nthat cryptocurrencies are called\ncrypto currencies is because they're\nsecured by cryptography\nand one example of this which a lot of\nthe major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin\nuse\nis blockchain now people often get\nconfused by this blockchain is not\nbitcoin blockchain is not a currency\nitself\nblockchain is just a secure type of\nledger so you know that big spreadsheet\nthat everyone has that's recording\ntransactions\nblockchain is just a way of organizing\nit funnily enough\ninto blocks so every time i pay for\nsomething with bitcoin\nthat transaction is recorded as a block\neach block contains transaction data\nlike who was paid and how much a hash\nwhich is a unique identifier\nand the hash of the previous block in\nthe sequence or the last transaction\nthat was recorded\nand the pivot on which this system rests\nis that if something in a block is\nchanged\nthen that block's hash will change you\nmight be starting to see where this is\ngoing because each block\nalso contains the data of the previous\nblock if the hash of the block here\nchanges\nthen the next block will no longer have\na matching hash with it and so every\nsubsequent block after that one\nbecomes invalid so if you combine this\nwith what we talked about earlier\nthis whole idea of a million different\nusers all having their own copy of the\nblockchain ledger\nthen if i wanted to fraudulently create\na transaction that say paid me money\ni'd have to not just tamper with a block\nand every single block after it\nbut i'd also have to do this on at least\nhalf a million computers around the\nworld\nso that the majority of computers in the\nsystem are also consistent with the one\ni've tampered with\nprobably not gonna happen whereas just\nhacking into someone's dollar account\nand sending myself money\nthat does happen and it's sometimes as\nsimple as just literally guessing\nsomeone's six-digit pin\nbut there's a massive jump between that\nand trying to hack into 500\n000 uncorrelated computers at once okay\nso\ncryptocurrencies have their issues i'm\nliterally going to get to them in a\nminute\nbut hopefully you can see why some\npeople are excited about them\nand that brings me on to investments\nyou've probably heard of people\nputting money into cryptocurrencies and\nall that means is that they're\nexchanging normal currencies like\ndollars\nfor cryptos like bitcoin they're hoping\nthat those cryptocurrencies become the\nnext big thing\nand therefore suddenly shoot up in value\nat which point they can then\neither spend them or just exchange them\nback for more dollars than they bought\nthem for\nthere's actually a term for\ncryptocurrencies that skyrocket like\nthis\ngoing to the moon or mooning\nbut that can mean something very\ndifferent depending on who you talk to\nbut the one decision that someone would\nhave to make at this point is\nwhich cryptocurrency because we've\ntalked about bitcoin but bitcoin is just\none of over 4 000 different cryptos\nalready and each of them have different\nproperties\nfor example ethereum which is the second\nmost invested in\ncan process transactions even faster\nthan bitcoin there's one called cardano\nwhich is considered to be\ntechnologically superior\nthere's one called litecoin which has a\nnewer algorithm and if you are enjoying\nthis video then a sub to the channel\nwould be\ndelightful so let me show you what i've\ndone\nand disclaimer this is not in any way at\nall\nfinancial advice i'm not recommending\nthis i've literally only put in a small\namount of money that i am comfortable\nlosing\nand to be honest the way i'm seeing it\nis more as an optimistic gamble\nas opposed to a strategic investment the\nonly thing that you absolutely should\nbuy is\none of these hats best purchase i've\never made\nthat is financial advice so i've put 40\nin ethereum 20\nto polygon 20 in cardano 10 in cartesi\nand 10 in litecoin and this portfolio\nhas basically gone up and then down and\nthen up and then down and then\nhonestly you probably get more\nconsistency from wish.com so\ncrypto is in a pretty weird place right\nnow and this brings me onto its problems\nthe dark side one of the main ones is\nexactly this\nthe reason i think a lot of people don't\ntake crypto seriously\nis its volatility because these\ncurrencies are so new\nand they're completely digital unlike\nsay the market for gold\nno one really knows what they should be\nworth and so you find that crypto prices\nare quite heavily speculative\nthey're tied to the news cycle like when\na glowing article comes out about them\nprices spiral upwards but then when elon\nmusk posts a tweet that puts them down\nthey go way down two is the fact that\nthey're not really accepted as a form of\npayment in\nwell most places like yes i can now book\nholidays with crypto\ni can donate to wikipedia with crypto\nbut there's been a lot of companies who\nare pretty back and forth with it\nmicrosoft tesla even burger king are\nexamples of companies who said they were\ngoing to accept bitcoin\nand then they said they weren't going to\naccept bitcoin three\nthere can be an environmental concern\nsee the whole reason why a lot of these\ncryptos are so secure\nis because of this concept of\ntransactions being verified many many\ntimes\nby many many computers so i think it's a\nfair criticism that that in itself\ncreates a fundamental inefficiency\nthat much computing power requires a lot\nof electricity\nbut at the same time you could counter\nthis by saying that traditional banking\nuses more electricity that there are\nnewer coins with better technology\nthat are more efficient and that one day\nwe'll be able to get that electricity\nfrom renewable sources\ndepends who you ask and four there's\nalso a pretty strong sentiment that\nbecause there's no real policing or\nregulation on crypto right now\nit's like the perfect currency for\ncriminals but to be honest i think the\ndata speaks for itself on that one\naccording to chain analysis 0.34 percent\nof crypto transactions are criminal\nup to 5 of normal cash transactions are\ncriminal and\ni think that's because it's a bit of a\nmisconception that currencies like\nbitcoin\nare anonymous they're actually\npseudonymous which means that even\nthough your actual details aren't\nvisible to everyone\nyour public key your unique identifier\nwill be\npermanently baked into the blockchain\nupon making transactions with it\nso cash is just a better currency for\nmost types of criminal activity\nbecause by its very nature it's\nuntraceable\ndon't ask me how i know that but as well\nas the negatives there are also just\nsome straight up odd things that have\ncome about\nbecause of crypto for example you might\nhave heard of an nft\na non-fungible token if you haven't\nyou might want to take a seat for this\none\ni don't want to call it stupid but uh\nthis one's a head scratcher\nso you know how now you can go into an\nart gallery and you can pay to own a\npainting\nwell now thanks to the blockchain you\ncan pay\njust to have digital ownership over\nsomething so it doesn't stop anyone from\nusing or sharing that thing\nbut all it means is that you'd\neffectively be the owner of the original\nand they'd all be sharing copies of it\neven if for most intents and purposes\nthey look and behave identically\nlike a lot of these nfts are literally\njust jpeg images\ni think the reason some people find this\nstupid and kind of funny\nis that there's a distinct difference\nbetween buying an nft and buying the\nrights over something\nso if you buy the right service\nsomething that's a very legitimate\npurchase because you can create merch or\nsell licenses\nwith an nft you can't the original owner\nstill has\nall the reproduction rights over that\npiece all it is\nis that you're using the blockchain to\nprove that you have some\nownership over that asset but clearly\njust being able to say that has some\nvalue because\nan nft of this gucci ghost sold for 3\n600\nthe ceo of twitter jack dorsey he sold\nthe first tweet he ever made\nas an nft for 2.9 million dollars\nfive words i could do that any takers\nand this one just blows my mind this\nphoto which is basically an overview of\none guy's pieces of art\nsold for 69 million dollars very\nnice to clarify this literally just\ngives the buyer some\ndigital ownership over a jpeg image\nand finally you might have heard of\ndogecoin dirt coin is based on the same\ntech as litecoin\nbut it was created as a joke people\nstarted sharing it and putting a bit of\nmoney into it because they thought it\nwas funny\nbut that propelled its value to the\npoint where now we have people who have\nactually become millionaires\njust because they bought dogecoin when\nit was cheap it's an interesting world\nout there\nif you did find this useful then do\nconsider sharing it with a friend or\nfamily member you could benefit\ni would really appreciate it and for my\nbest phones of 2021\nclick here for an instagram story that\ncrashes your phone click here\nmy name is aaron this is mr who's the\nboss i'll catch you in the next one\n",
