  "text": "until recently access to the internet\nwas limited via devices like the desktop\ntablet or smartphone but now with the\ninternet of things aka iot practically\nall appliances can be connected to the\ninternet and monitored remotely\nit is a system of interconnected devices\nthat transfer data\nover a wireless network without any\nhuman intervention\nso hey everyone welcome to this iot\ntutorial video\nin this video we help you understand\nwhat iot is and how it is impacting our\nday-to-day life\nwe will also understand the iot\narchitecture and look at the new\ntrending iot projects for 2021.\nbut before that if you haven't\nsubscribed to our channel already make\nsure to hit the subscribe button and the\nbell icon to never miss an update\ni'm sure you're excited to learn so\nlet's dive right in\nimagine you're at work and realize that\nyou might not have turned off the air\nconditioner while leaving your house\ninstead of traveling all the way back\nhome what if you could use your\nsmartphone to know the status of your ac\nand perhaps even turn it off\nwouldn't that be amazing\nwell yes\nand this can be achieved with the help\nof the internet of things\nuntil recently access to the internet\nwas limited via devices like the desktop\ntablet or smartphone but now with iot\npractically all appliances can be\nconnected to the internet and monitored\nremotely iot is shaping the way we live\nour lives it helps us get a better\ninsight into the working of things\naround us\nso what exactly is the internet of\nthings\niot is a system of interrelated devices\nconnected to the internet to transfer\nand receive data from one to the other a\nsmart home is the best example of iot\nhome appliances like the ac doorbell\nthermostats smoke detectors water\nheaters and security alarms can be\ninterconnected to share data with the\nuser over a mobile application\nthe user can now get detailed insight\ninto the working of the devices around\nhim\nthink about it until recently the\ninternet helped people connect and\ninteract with each other but now\ninanimate objects or things have the\nability to sense the surroundings to\ninteract and collaborate with one\nanother\nfor example\nin the morning when your alarm goes off\nthe iot system can open the window\nblinds turn on the coffee pot for you\nand even turn on the water heater\nalthough all of this is fascinating\nthere's a lot that goes on in the\nbackground to ensure seamless\nfunctioning from effective communication\nbetween devices to accurate processing\nof the data received a lot of components\nare involved\nin the context of iot devices hardware\ncan be classified into general devices\nand sensing devices the general devices\nare the main components of the data hub\nand information exchange\nthey are connected either by wired or\nwireless interfaces home appliances are\na classic example of such devices\nthe sensing devices on the other hand\ninclude sensors and actuators they\nmeasure the temperature humidity light\nintensity and other parameters\nthese iot devices are connected to the\nnetwork with the help of gateways\nthese gateways or processing nodes\nprocess the information collected from\nthe sensors and transfer it to the cloud\nthe cloud acts as both the storage and\nprocessing unit actions are performed on\nthe collected data for further learning\nand inferences\nwired and wireless interfaces like wi-fi\nbluetooth zigbee gsms and so on are used\nto provide connectivity to ensure its\nubiquity applications need to support a\ndiverse set of devices and communication\nprotocols from tiny sensors capable of\nsensing and reporting the desired factor\nto powerful backend servers that are\nutilized for data analysis and knowledge\nextraction\nto help you understand it's working\nlet's take a simple scenario\nlet's suppose you want to water your\ngarden every time the moisture level in\nthe soil drops\ninstead of doing it manually you could\nautomate it using iot\nthe sensors and actuators installed\ngauge the soil for its moisture this\ninformation is sent to the iot gateway\nwith the help of communication protocols\nlike mqtt or http the gateway\nsignificantly aggregates data and feeds\nit to the cloud with the help of wi-fi\nlan\nonce the moisture level drops the system\nis immediately triggered and the\nsprinklers are turned on however with\nthe information stored in the cloud a\ndetailed analysis like the time of the\nday the sprinkler was turned on the rate\nat which the moisture in the soil\nreduces and so on can be done and the\nreport could be sent over to you on your\nsmartphone over an app\nwith the improved response monitoring\nand analytical capabilities iot is being\nadopted in almost all industries and\ndomains opening doors to endless\napplications\ntoday iot is being used extensively to\nlessen the burden on humans to name a\nfew iot is deployed for smart homes\nwearables watches and bracelets smart\ncars\nsmart farming smart retail smart grids\nsmart city and smart health care\nwith such a wide spectrum of\napplications the future of i.t looks\nmore promising than ever before\nin 2018 there were about 23 billion\nconnected devices which was more than\ndouble the world population\naccording to experts there will be over\n80 billion devices by 2025. iot is a\nvision to connect all devices with the\npower of the internet always learning\nand always growing\nnow that you have a picture of what iot\nis here's a simple question for you\nwhich of the following technologies is\nnot used as an interface for a network\none wi-fi\ntwo ethernet\nthree\nzigbee\nfour\nvpn\ngive it a thought and leave your answers\nin the comments section below three\nlucky winners will receive amazon gift\nvouchers\nthe integration of iot with other\ntechnologies like cloud computing\nmachine learning and artificial\nintelligence is paving the way for many\nnew and exciting innovations\nand that is the internet of things for\nyou in short\nthe first wave of the internet\nrevolution came in with the growth of\npersonal computers and in the second\nwave the internet came right onto our\npalms that is with the advent of mobile\ndevices and here we are leaving the\nthird wave where all electronic devices\nare almost already connected to the\ninternet or will be in the near future\nyes the internet of things will bring\nabout the next industrial revolution and\nwill drastically transform the way we\nlive and experience technology today\nquite possibly the internet of things\nwill be as disruptive as the internet\nitself particularly when combined with\nbig data and predictive analytics\nbut what exactly is iot the concept\nbehind iot is about connecting just\nabout everything to the internet in real\ntime which directly improves our quality\nof life and experiences\nfor instance how are you watching this\nvideo right now on a pc a mobile or a\ntablet well whichever device you're\nusing is definitely connected to the\ninternet and that means you're already\nusing an iot device\nsensors are becoming the end points of\niot networks wondering what exactly a\nsensor is\nthese sensors collect an increasing\namount of context aware data and\ninformation such as location images\nweather conditions and inject them into\nnetworks actuators and applications in\nreal time\nbig data analytics and predictions have\nbecome apparent synonymous helping\nperform and execute tasks seamlessly\nwith minimal to zero errors\nare you ready to admit a major\nbreakthrough\nlife in the present is great but the\nfuture looks like it could be way more\nexciting how we may ask\nsince there are billions of physical\ndevices around the world that are now\nconnected to the internet collecting and\nsharing data in real time terabytes of\ndata are going to become better bytes\nwhich represents 1000 terabytes each\nthere is going to be a shift from\nwideband networks to narrowband networks\nfor better range\nand you'll also soon witness the\ncommunication system transcend from 4g\nto 5g wireless communications\n[Music]\niot will definitely be the paradigm\nshift of effective multitasking with\nmassive applications\nnow let's have a look at the future with\niot environment\nimagine you're driving your smart car to\nwork and you're quite late don't you\nworry because your car can now provide\nthe shortest route with less congestion\nnot only that the integrated sensors in\nthe car alerts you about mechanical\nassistance you also have the access to\nautomatic temperature control and not to\nforget in case you're tired or wary the\ncar becomes self-driven since it comes\nwith an accident prevention system\n[Music]\nas you are driving you see the smart\nfarms through your window farmers are\nhappier thanks to iot which helped them\nwith better heat and provided more\nefficiency than ever\nyou might wonder how with the help of\nsystems like autonomous self-driving\ntractors adaptive irrigation systems\nsoil health monitoring and animal\nwelfare monitoring systems this is\npossible\nyou also see smart factories which use\niiot that is industrial internet of\nthings with the help of analytics and\nautomation systems iiot helps in\ntracking goods in real time inventory\nmanagement automated delivery system and\nmuch more\nnow you're returning home from office\nyour car can park itself automatically\nyour fingerprint voice or even your\nsmartphone is enough to control all home\nappliances from lights to television and\nyour door to water taps too are you\nexcited to experience this smart future\nwhich is not far away of course you\nshould be\nthe applications of iot will be seen in\nevery industry across sectors be it\neducation healthcare manufacturing\nautomotive you name it iot is definitely\ngoing to have a role to play in each one\nof them\npossibly the fourth wave will be the\ninternet of everything or ioe\nwhich would encompass all physical\nthings processes data and people through\nwearables and surgically implanted\nsensors unlike iot which focuses only on\nphysical devices\nchange is the only constant and the\nworld will never be the same with the\ngrowth of ubiquitous connectivity and\niot is sure to change the way billions\nof people live their lives today why to\ninternet of things\nas a learner you should learn iot as it\nprovides better scope for future data\nscientists as well as provides for\npromising career opportunities\nyou can also build and manage your own\niot for your home as a company executive\nyou should learn iot because it will\nhelp you measure everything in the\nbusiness you also get real-time metrics\nactionable data and better connectivity\nacross industries\nafter completing this course you should\nbe able to explain the concept of\ninternet of things comprehensive\ndescribe hardware software and other\nconnectivity building blocks of iot\ndescribe design considerations\npertaining architecture\nframework and interoperability\nexplain the security considerations with\niot pertaining to vulnerabilities\nexplain industry 4.0 internet to\neverything and social iot\nand finally describe iot framework in\nenterprises\nin the context of iot devices hardware\ncan be divided into two categories\ngeneral devices and sensing devices\nthe general devices do the embedded\nprocessing and connectivity for the\nplatforms they are connected either by\nwired network or wireless interfaces\nthey are the main component for data\ncollection and information processing\nthe current home appliances are classic\nexample of such devices that are\ncontrolled by a sensor these sensors\nhelp solve common problems\napart from sensors actuators are another\nimportant device in iot that perform\nsimilar functions with different\ncapabilities they work as interface\nbetween sensors and machines and collect\nvarious information like humidity and\nlight intensity\nthis information is computed using the\nedge layer which typically sits between\nthe cloud and the sensor they are the\nlayers that store the intermittent\ntransfer of information\nfinally the backend server of the cloud\nprocesses this information\nboth the sensors and actuators are the\nchief components of iot the sensors\nmeasure temperature humidity light\nintensity and other key parameters of\nhome environment\nthe second most crucial aspect of iot is\ndevice management platforms or dmps\nthe dmvs as they are shortly called are\nthe platforms through which these assets\ninteract with the software layer through\nnetwork gateways dmps come with various\nfunctionalities which include firmware\nupgrades security patching and reporting\nof metrics they also help develop alert\nmechanism for industrial equipment with\nmore open source os like arduino overall\nit is an important aspect of the\nmanagement of the device penetration\nconnectivity blocks connectivity blocks\ncollectively is considered as the\nbackbone of an iot setup\nthere are various connectivity layers\nlike usb can protocols and modbus\nthe next generation protocols of wi-fi\nare laura and zigbee they can interface\nwith any application or modules a small\ndevice embedded in an object\nthe entire landscape is called gateway\narchitecture\nvarious ports are\n232.485 from usb that come with gateway\narchitecture\nthe device interface is important for\nthe data transfer and enables digital\ntransformation with third-party\napplications and systems\ncommunication protocols and standards\nlet us try to understand the various\ncommunication protocols available to set\nup an iot\nthe first is the satellite this enables\nthe cell phone communication through an\nantenna situated within 10 to 15 miles\nthey have a stable and universal\nconnection\nthe second is the protocol is the wi-fi\nand is based on five gigahertz\nfrequencies\nit provides internet access within a\ncertain range and are an affordable\noption\nit has well protected protocols\nthe third is the radio frequency\nit is the easiest form of communication\na few examples are zigbee and z-wave\nwhich use low-power rf radio\nit consumes low energy which is very\nadvantageous\nit's relatively simple to configure\nthe fourth in this list is rfid it uses\nwireless electromagnetic fields to\nidentify sensors and objects\ngood thing about it is that it does not\nrequire power\nthe fifth is bluetooth which is useful\nfor short term and short distance data\nexchange it is present in every\nsmartphone and has sensors\nthe final one is near field\ncommunication or nfc it uses\nelectromagnetic induction and loop\nantennas\nit comes with encryption has low speed\ncommunication and is used for short\nrange data exchange\nfuture of iot connectivity\niot connectivity is the future the\nlaunch of new technologies like 5g\nthe 5g with low latency and higher\nthroughput will increase the penetration\nof iot\n5g cellular technology is supported by\nthe network for virtualization\neven for the common use case such as for\nt vendor real-time predictive analytics\ncan be available\nso\noverall the delivery time is reduced\nwith iot\n5g and iot are embedded technologies\nboth can be sliced and diced for\npredictive analytics and real-time\nbusiness decisions\n5g will help devices connect through a\nnetwork with high speed bandwidth\niot device architecture\nthere are four layers in the device\narchitecture\nthe base layer consists of iot devices\nthis includes all the components like\nsensors with the ability to sense\ncompute and connect other devices\nlet's move on to the second layer which\nis the iot gateway or aggregation layer\nthis layer significantly aggregates data\nfrom various sensors these two layers\nform the definition engine and they set\nthe rules for data aggregation next\nlayer is based on cloud it's called\nprocessing engine or event processing\nlayer it has numerous algorithms and\ndata processing elements that are\nultimately displayed on a dashboard\nthis layer basically processes the data\nobtained from the sensor layer\nthe last layer is called the application\nlayer or api management layer it acts as\nan interface between third-party\napplication and infrastructure the\nentire landscape is supported by device\nmanagers and identity and access\nmanagers\nwhich are useful for security of the\narchitecture\nmany individuals and organizations have\ncontributed to create and set the\nstandard it covers the entire network\nand endpoint systems it brings a\nstructural approach with security\ncontrols in place it provides a\ndemarcation based on its uses for\nenterprise to build iot products this\nstandard has 85 detailed recommendations\nand a structured approach that can fit\ninto any iot ecosystem it has a flexible\nframework addressing the diversity of\nthe technology aligned to the regulation\nit also has risk modeling capabilities\nfor any organization to choose from\nincluding endpoint ecosystems the\nstandard is very flexible and comes with\nthe inbuilt risk assessments for any\norganization to adapt overall it is an\ninteresting standard and easy to get\ntrained at iot security best practices\nthere are many best practices in iot\nsecurity let's look at some best\npractices pertaining to iot hardware\nfirst of all the hardware should be\ntamper-proof\nthey should have undergone dynamic\ntesting with specific data protection\nalgorithms and should be updated on\nfirmware and patches\nthe network components must be authentic\nwith encryption kernel controls and\ndivision of networks into segments\nother security measures include privacy\nprotection for sensitive information and\nother regulations like safe harbor\nstatements\nthere are many value drivers to help the\ninternet of everything\nkey drivers are employee productivity\nsupply and logistics\ncustomer experiences\ninnovation and time to market asset\nutilization all the factors are tightly\nlinked to generate a new revenue gains\nfor any enterprise\ntime to market and innovation\nthis will help with the competitive\nindex\nof the organization\nhe'll help discover mvp to reduce the\ncost of building\nand bring improvement in customer\nexperience\nasset utilization is the form of digital\nphysical and even smart assets the asset\ndiscovery is the requirement for the\nestablishment of the iot ecosystem\nsupply chain is also a key value driver\nand assesses the requirement of internet\nof everything\nin addition to the drivers there are\nsignificant elements\nthe elements stand in four buckets the\nfirst is data which encapsulates sending\nand analyzing data\nthe second bucket is the people\nwho are always connected and have\ncontextual subject mapping with the\nreal-time world for decision making\nthe third bucket is the things which\nlink people to machine with endpoints\nibi addresses and sensors\nthe last bucket is machined to data\nwhich talks with a business value and\naction iteration\nessentially building simple models to\nachieve corporate results\ninternet of everything growth engine the\ninternet of everything comes with a\ngrowth engine for any organization it\nincludes people or the most valuable\nresources\nthe process of making the right effort\nthe things that includes the physical\ndevices other objects and the data taken\nfrom sensors to make actionable insights\nfor decision making is important\npeople\nprocess\nthings\nand data are the growth engine elements\nit gives the company an edge in the\ndigital transformation world\nwith data privacy and transparency\nmechanism it is important for every\norganization to follow internet ethics\nand compliance\niot and fleet management\nlet's discuss some use cases of iot\nthe fleet management is a classic\nexample of iot in application in this\ndomain iot is mainly used to track\nvehicles from one point to another\nusing iot technology the entire fleet\ncan be monitored with a support of rfid\nchips embedded within every car in the\nfleet\nthe same rfid can also be used to track\nproducts such as consumer goods\nelectronics and food items\nyou can get real-time information on the\nroutes that the fleet takes\nthere are obd devices that can be used\nto track vehicles behavior and\nperformance including fuel consumption\nand mileage\nthis can reduce the total cost and\nprovide greater return on investment\naccording to a recent study the iot\nmarket will increase to 8.28 billion\ndollars by 2021. sensor's linked\nartificial intelligence help the bankers\ntrack all the activities in the back end\nthe advancements of mobile phones and\ndigital assistants along with 5g\nconnectivity makes customer experience\nseamless\nfirst and foremost it is data\ndata is the new oil\nfinancial institutions have structured\nand unstructured data of the customers\nthey can slice and dice the data for\nprofiling segmentation product launches\nand digital services enablement\nthe data can create a large economic\ndrive and give rise to new business\nmodels like nfc banking digital\nassistance banking and social media\nbanking\nwith this transformation internet of\nthings provides competitive advantage to\nthe banking insurance and financial\nservices\nwhile the end goal remains to help\ncustomers save money and give a bundle\noffer\nlet's understand how iot revolutionizes\nvarious industries\nwith the advent of the internet of\nthings there are many industries\nexperiencing digital transformation such\nas financial services healthcare\nmanufacturing communications energy\nretail and transportation\niot has initiated changes at all levels\nuser infrastructure and large-scale\napplications analytics with real-time\ndashboard and iot support allows\ninformed decision making for businesses\nthis also means that iot is introducing\na new revenue model for enterprises\naround the world\nlearning objectives by the end of this\nlesson you will be able to\nexplain the iot architecture and\nframeworks describe the iot\ninteroperability and its design\nconsiderations and discuss\nindustry-aligned use cases\niot device architecture\nthere are four layers in the device\narchitecture the base layer consists of\niot devices\nthis includes all the components like\nsensors with the ability to sense\ncompute and connect other devices\nlet's move on to the second layer which\nis the iot gateway or aggregation layer\nthis layer significantly aggregates data\nfrom various sensors these two layers\nform the definition engine and they set\nthe rules for data aggregation next\nlayer is based on cloud is called\nprocessing engine or event processing\nlayer it has numerous algorithms and\ndata processing elements that are\nultimately displayed on a dashboard\nthis layer basically processes the data\nobtained from the sensor layer the last\nlayer is called the application layer or\napi management layer\nit acts as an interface between\nthird-party application and\ninfrastructure the entire landscape is\nsupported by device managers and\nidentity and access managers\nwhich are useful for security of the\narchitecture\niot reference architecture next let's\nlearn about the various layers in iot\nreference architecture device layer\nthe device layer is the main component\nwhere there are various devices like\nsensors that are interconnected some\nexamples are bluetooth connected via\nmobile phone and zigbee via zigbee\ngateway the other devices include the\nraspberry pi that's connected to the\nethernet via wi-fi this is directly\nconnected to the communication layers\nwhich are part of the second layer\ncommunication layer the communication\nlayer or gateway layer has rest\nprotocols\nand other application level protocols\nboth layers are tightly coupled and\ngenerate enormous amount of data\nnow the bus layer or aggregation layer\nacts as a message broker it forms a\nbridge between the data and the\ncommunication layer for the sensors\nthis is an important layer for three\nreasons it supports an http server and\nor a mqtt broker\nit aggregates and combines\ncommunications via gateway and it\nbridges and transforms data between\ndifferent protocols\nthe next layer is the event processing\nand analytics layer which drives data\nand provides transformation to the data\ngenerated\nit provides the ability to do event\nprocessing the data is stored in the\ndatabase\nthe client layer is used to create a\nweb-based engine to interact with\nexternal apis\nthis can be fed into the api management\nsystems this layer helps create a\ndashboard and provides a view of\nanalytics and event processing\nthis layer helps communicate with\nsystems outside the network using\nmachine and machine communication\nso we've seen the comprehensive iot\nreference architecture with various\ncomponents rule engines interfaces and\nsecurity systems embedded\ncross-functional architecture is\npossible using device manager that\nprovides a single platform for remote\nmanagement the device manager\ncommunicates with devices through set\nprotocols\ndevice management uses device management\nagents and is responsible for the remote\nmanagement of software\nthe identity layer has the capabilities\nof cyber security including policy\ncontrol and oauth 2 token instruments\nother capabilities include identity\nservices xacml pdp and directory of\nusers eg\nldap iot reference frameworks there are\na lot of frameworks for iot setup but\nthe most common is the iso\n30141 and it provides commonly used\nvocabulary reusable designs and best\npractices for any developer to design an\napplication\nit also has many secure application\nstandards that derive the maximum\nbenefit for the organization and reduce\nthe risks\niot standardization and design\nconsiderations\nthere are a number of iot standards\nand these are evolving over time some of\nthe key ones are m2m that is a machine\nto machine service layer that can be\nembedded in hardware and software to\nconnect devices\ncontiki which is an open source\noperating system for low cost low power\niot microcontrollers\nlight os\na unix-like operating system for\nwireless sensor networks\nrandom phase multiple access\nthis is a proprietary standard for\nconnecting iot objects the last one is\nsig fox a proprietary low power low\nthroughput technology for iot and m2m\ncommunications\niot\ninteroperability challenges\niot maturity comes with several\nchallenges specifically pertaining to\ninteroperability and interfacing the\nreasons are coexistence of multifarious\nsystems\ndevices sensors equipment etc that\ninterchange location time dependent\ninformation in varied data formats\nlanguages data models constructs data\nquality and complex interrelationships\nmultivision\nsystem designed by manufacturers over\ntime for varied application domains\nmaking formulation of global agreements\nand commonly accepted specifications\nvery difficult\nnew things that get introduced and that\nsupport a new unanticipated structures\nand protocols existence of low power\ndevices which need to exchange data over\nlossy networks and may have minimal\nlikelihood or accessibility for a power\nrecharge in months or years\niot design considerations when you\nchoose an iot solution you need to\nconsider several factors\nlike its wireless capability\nfunctionality interoperability secure\nstorage\nimmediate boot capacity device\ncategorization bandwidth cryptographic\ncontrol and power management the design\nconsiderations should be a mix of the\nestimated average of all these\ncomponents and index to balance the user\nrequirements you also need to set up a\ndispute resolution mechanism in case of\nfailure in the long run\niot device architecture network and\ncloud there are four stages of\nintegrating the different iot processes\nstage 1 network things wireless sensors\nand actuators\nstage 2 sensor data aggregation systems\nand analog to digital data conversion\nstage 3 the appearance of edge i.t\nsystems\nstage four analysis management and\nstorage of data as these stages are\nevolving the devices the network and the\ncloud application must be leveled\nequally in ecosystem for better\nstability and security the iot\narchitecture is a combination of things\ndevices platform and sensors with data\nstage 1 of an iot architecture consists\nof networked things typically wireless\nsensors and actuators stage 2 has\ninternet gateways and data acquisition\nsystems that includes sensor data\naggregation systems and analog to\ndigital conversion in stage 3 edge it\nsystems perform pre-processing of the\ndata before it moves to the data center\nor cloud finally in stage 4\ndata center and cloud is where the data\nis analyzed managed and stored on\ntraditional backend data center systems\nfundamentally we need to have a\nfunctional scalable available and\nmaintainable architecture if these are\nnot supported then architecture is not\nuseful now let's look at the three\narchitecture areas of iot one the client\nside iot device layer two operators on\nthe server side iot gateway layer\nand three a pathway for connecting\nclients and operators iot platform layer\nthese three layers interface with each\nother on a data synchronization front\nand pathway to generate more data from\nvarious applications the feasibility of\nthe layers depends on their application\nlet's now differentiate between\ncentralized and decentralized iot\narchitectures the centralized\narchitecture is a hub and is managed\nfrom one point whereas the decentralized\none is based on the use case\nthey do not help in industrial iot\nsolution the centralized architecture is\nassociated with cloud architectures in\nwhich a central hub provides a series of\nback-end services to smart devices in\ndecentralized architecture there are\nmany scenarios that require autonomous\ncommunication between smart devices and\nan iot topology without the need of\nessential hub the centralized systems\nhelp in event processing and whereas\ndecentralized systems operate more of\npeer-to-peer messaging the decentralized\nauditing is one of the essential\nfeatures that decentralized architecture\nuse case i have smart farming\nuse case smart farming iot design this\nuse case addresses the design\nformalities using iot iot design is an\nessential part of the navigational\necosystem smart farming requires precise\narchitecture and components that help\nbring benefits to the farmers the\nvarious factors that determine the iot\ndesign are data cost efficiency and\nproduct quality the efficiency and\ndurability of the ecosystem help the\nfarmers plan their harvest and sow based\non the climatic conditions using the\nsensors and geospatial location data so\nbe precise any farmer needs to\nunderstand the fundamental design that\ncan help run the ecosystem smart farming\nis useful as it helps the farmer to\npredict conditions and sow crops with\nless cost and utilize automation\ncapabilities to have such systems you\nneed to purchase the right hardware\nwhich can monitor the accuracy of data\nand quality of the sensor once you have\nthese systems you can benefit more from\nfarming there are four things you need\nto integrate for smart farming first is\na data engine smart farming should have\na robust data processing engine that can\nact as the brain and handle data\nprocessing storage and lead to efficient\noutput\nthe second is hardware you need to\nensure that the hardware is durable and\neasy to maintain hardware or self-fixing\nalgorithms is even better\nthe third aspect is mobile access this\nis possible using a smartphone along\nwith offline or online mobile\napplications\nto enable all three processes you need\ncloud infrastructure with the edge layer\nthis iot system can enable smart farming\nfor any crops in any geographical\nlocation let us look at another use case\non using sim cards to monitor sugar\nlevel in a diabetic patient diabetes\nmanagement is a recurring concept where\nthe patient has to check the blood sugar\nat regular intervals in the traditional\nway he has to go to the physician lab or\nhe has to have his home blood glucose\nmonitoring system iot can help create a\nsystem with the blood glucose data will\nbe transmitted remotely via smartphone\nand a sim embedded in it\nidentifying the necessary and right\nhardware is one of the crucial steps of\ncreating such a system you need to\nchoose the sensors for your device or\ncreate a custom one which fits the\nglucometer this can be a sim card the\nnext step is to ensure that the quality\nof your sensors is good and has seamless\nintegration with the system finally make\nsure that the data monitoring happens in\nreal time with high accuracy now when\nthe hardware landscape of this ecosystem\nis ready you need to set the software\nthen first it is crucial that you have\nsoftware with software pair algorithm\nfor service management to enable this\nprocess you need cloud infrastructure\nwith edge and finally a smartphone to\nwork with the devices and sensors\nkey takeaways now that you have\ncompleted this lesson you should be able\nto explain iot reference architectures\nand frameworks describe the iot interop\nability and its design considerations\nand finally\ndiscuss industry-aligned use cases\nhere's a list of iot projects for 2020.\nfirst up is smart mirror smart mirrors\nare a very cool iot application\nthese mirrors can be used to display\ntemperature news weather calendar clock\nand complements on the screen apart from\nthese smart mirrors can be used to click\nthe perfect selfies with a built-in\ncamera it can also be installed with\nspeakers to play some music and they\nalso provide on-demand workout sessions\nwith world-class trainers\nthe mirror can be used to browse the\ninternet make phone calls and even be\nconnected with other devices for\ncollaboration\nnext up is smart money transfer we're\nheading towards complete digitization\ntransactions are made possible on your\ncell phone with apps like apple pay\ngoogle pay and paypal\nbut imagine if you could walk to a store\nand pay with a wrist watch wouldn't that\nbe cool the purpose of the smart wallet\nis to provide an easy and reliable\nplatform for money transactions it is\ncompact variable and rechargeable for\nsafety purposes the user authenticity is\nvalidated the smart money transfer\ntechnology can reduce the burden of\nmobile money transfer when you're on the\ngo you could easily step into a store\npurchase the goods and pay hassle free\nafter every successful transaction the\nbalance is updated immediately to avoid\nany uncertainty next up is iot based\nsmart arm\nnow this project includes the creation\nof a robotic arm which can pick and\nplace things from one place to another\nto control this action the robotic arm\ncan be moved using specific commands\nsome advanced arms allow the user to\nchange the end effect of the arm to\nperform various different actions it can\nbe used to make art print 3d images and\nbuild production lines\nit can also be used to perform your\nday-to-day chores at number four we have\nsmart irrigation\nnow with changing climate and recurrent\nwater crisis\nfarmers suffer a great deal with growing\ncrops smart irrigation puts an end to\nthis ordeal\nthis system comes with the moisture\nsensor that checks the soil for its\nwater content when the soil moisture\ndrops below a certain value the system\ntriggers the water supply at number five\nwe have smart door now as the name\nsuggests this project aims at creating\nsmart doors that control the entry and\nexit of humans these doors open and\nclose automatically when you pass by\nthe door can also be controlled remotely\nyou could unlock the door for a friend\nby tapping an icon on your smartphone\nonce they exit you're immediately\nnotified the owner can also choose who\nhas the access to the door at number 6\nwe have air monitoring system now air\nmonitoring has become crucial for the\nenvironment and what better way to do it\nthan incorporating iot the iot system\nuses air sensors to sense the presence\nof harmful gases or compounds in the air\nthe data collected can be used by the\nlocal authorities to make a detailed\nanalysis\nnecessary actions can also be taken to\nensure that the air quality levels don't\nreach an extreme low especially in areas\nwith hospitals and schools\nmoving on to number seven we have smart\nalarm clock now there are many\nvariations of a smart alarm clock but\nthe alarm we are talking about is a self\nsetting alarm the smart alarm clock uses\nyour google calendar to check your\nappointments to set the alarm it can\nalso procure data from gps about your\neta to a particular place and consider\nthe weather to automatically adjust your\nwake time\nall of this is just making life more\neasier moving on at number eight we have\niot based weather reporting system\nnow the system deals with monitoring\nweather and climate changes like\nhumidity temperature moisture wind speed\nuv radiation light intensity and even\ncarbon monoxide levels in the air using\nmultiple sensors now these installed\nsensors send data to the web page that\nis plotted as graphical statistics\nthe project even consists of an\napplication that sends notifications as\nan effective alert to warn people about\nsudden and drastic weather changes\nso when you're heading out the app could\neasily tell you what the weather will be\nlike and suggest carrying an umbrella or\nperhaps a sunblock\nat number 9 we have smart wheelchair\nthere are over 132 million wheelchair\nusers across the globe\nsmart wheelchairs is an excellent\ninnovation typically it comes with\nbuilt-in sensors on the seats that\ncollect data every second\nthe data provides insight into the\nseating behavior of the patient and the\nenergy required to maintain the posture\nother variations of smart wheelchairs\ncould include fall detection these\nfeatures allow people to monitor the\npatient from a remote location\nand finally at number 10 we have smart\nstreet light system\nthis iot based street light monitoring\nsystem not only monitors but also\nensures low power consumption and\ndetects faulty lights\nthe street lights have external sensing\nthat automatically turns on at the\ndesired intensity based on the lighting\nneeded\ncontrol of light intensity is based on\nthe movement of people or vehicles\nin case of an emergency the lights\nincrease the brightness to maximum\nintensity thereby ensuring safety\nwhen deployed as a part of a smart city\nthe users can be informed about any\noutages\nthey can also register a complaint for\nimmediate service\nand so with that we come to the end of\nthis session i hope you have a good\nunderstanding of iot now thank you so\nmuch for being here keep learning and\nstay tuned to simply learn\nhi there
