  "text": "my SmartWatch tracks how much sleep I\nget each night if I'm feeling curious I\ncan look on my phone and see my nightly\nSlumber plotted on a graph it might look\nsomething like this and on the graph on\nthe y-axis we have the hours\nof sleep and then on the x-axis we have\ndays\nand this is an example\nof a Time series\nand what a Time series is\nis data of the same entity like my sleep\nhours collected at regular intervals\nlike over days and when we have time\nseries we can perform a Time series\nanalysis\nand this is where we analyze the\ntimestamp data to extract meaningful\ninsights and predictions\nabout the future\nand while it's super useful to forecast\nthat I'm going to probably get like\nseven hours shut eye tonight based on\nthe data time series analysis plays a\nsignificant role in helping\norganizations drive a Better Business\ndecisions so for example using time\nseries analysis a retailer can use this\nfunctionality to predict future sales\nand optimize their inventory levels\nconversely if you're into purchasing a\npurchaser can use time series analysis\nto predict commodity prices and make\ninformed purchasing decisions and then\nin fields like agriculture we can use\ntime series analysis to predict weather\npatterns influencing decisions on\nharvesting and when to plant\nso let's first of all introduce number\none\nthe components\nof Time series analysis and then number\ntwo we're going to take a look at some\nof the\nforecasting models\nfor performing time series analysis and\nthen number three we're going to talk\nabout how to implement\nsome of this stuff\nokay now let's talk about the components\nfirst of all and one component is called\ntrend\nnow this component refers to the overall\ndirection of the data over time whether\nit's increasing whether it's decreasing\nperhaps it's staying the same so you can\nthink of it like a line on the graph\nthat's either going up or going down or\nstaying flat\nthat's the first component the second\none\nseasonality\nnow this component is a repeating\npattern of data over a set period of\ntime like the way that retail sales\nSpike during the holiday season so we\nmight see a spike and then a bit lower\nthe spike is back and it keeps repeating\nlike that that's seasonality\nthird component\nthat's cycle\nand cycle refers to repeating but\nnon-seasonal patterns in the data so\nthese might be economic booms and busts\nthat happen over several years or maybe\neven decades so it's a much smoother\ncurve\nand then lastly there is variation\nand variation refers to the\nunpredictable ups and downs in the data\nthat cannot be explained by these other\ncomponents and this component is also\nknown as irregularity or noise and well\nit looks like maybe that\nyeah very difficult to pick out the\ntrend\nso those are some of the components of\nTime series but let's talk about the\nforecasting models that we can use to\nperform some analysis and there are\nseveral popular forecasting models out\nthere one of the most well known is\ncalled the\narima model\nnow arima that stands for auto\nregressive integrated moving average and\nthe model is made up of three components\nso there's the the AR part that's the\nauto regressive component and that looks\nat how past values affect future values\nthen there's the I for\nintegrated or differencing components\nand that accounts for Trends and\nseasonality and then there is the m a\ncomponent that's the moving average\ncomponent and that Smooths out the Noise\nby removing non-deterministic or random\nmovements from a Time series\nso that's arima another pretty popular\none you'll often see is called\nexponential smoothing\nand exponential smoothings model is is\nused to forecast time series data that\ndoesn't have a clear Trend or\nseasonality so it doesn't fit into these\nkind of areas and this model works by\nsmoothing out the data by giving more\nweight to recent values and less weight\nto older values and there are many other\nforecasting models out there and the\nright one to use of course depends on\nthe data you're working with and the\nspecific problem you're trying to solve\nokay so that's finally talk a little bit\nabout implementation how do we implement\nthis there are several software packages\nout there that can help you perform time\nseries analysis and forecasting such as\nthose with r and Python and Matlab\nso if we just focus in on on python\nfor a moment\ntwo of the most popular libraries for\ntime series analysis in Python\nfirstly pandas\nand secondly\na library called mat plot\nlied\nwith pandas you can easily import\nmanipulate and analyze the time series\ndata and it can handle things like\nmissing values aggregate data and\nperform statistical analysis on the data\nMatt plot live is a library that can\nhelp you visualize the time series data\nyou can create line charts or Scatter\nPlots and heat Maps using these\nlibraries you can perform a wide range\nof Time series analysis tasks like data\ncleaning exploratory data analysis and\nmodeling you can use pandas to\npre-process your time series data and\nthen use mat plus live to visualize the\ntrends and seasonalities in that data\nlook by understanding the components of\na Time series and then choosing the\nright forecasting model you can make\nmore informed decisions and gain a\ncompetitive Advantage so look whether\nyou're a data analyst or a business\nowner or just a curious sleeper take\nadvantage of the power of Time series\nanalysis and get a glimpse into what the\nfuture may hold\nif you have any questions please drop us\na line below and if you want to see more\nvideos like this in the future please\nlike And subscribe thanks for watching\n",
