  "text": "data is the most\nvaluable asset which is the reason why\ndata security has become an\ninternational agenda\ndata breaches and security failures can\nput the world economy at risk\nrealizing the need for the national and\neconomic security\nthe president of the united states\nissued an executive order to develop a\ncyber security framework\nto help reduce cyber risks hi folks my\nname is arya and here i am\nwith another interesting video on cyber\nsecurity\nso first let's have a look at the agenda\nof today's session all right\nto begin with we'll see how the us\ngovernment recognize the need for\nreliable function\nto secure the national and economic\ninfrastructure to improve critical\ninfrastructure security\nnext we will discuss the importance of\ncyber security frameworks\nand why it is required in an\norganization then i'll be telling you\nabout\ndifferent types of frameworks moving on\ni'll tell you about the components of\ncybersecurity frameworks that make it up\nall\nand after discussing the framework i'll\ntell you what steps are required to\nimplement frameworks in an organization\nfinally i'll describe a common flow of\ninformation\nand decisions at the different levels\nwithin an organization\nokay so let's begin so recognizing the\nnational\nand economic security of the united\nstates depends on the reliable function\nof critical infrastructure\nthe president issued executive order\n13636\nwhich is improving critical\ninfrastructure cyber security\nin february 2013. the order directed\nnist to work with stakeholders to\ndevelop a voluntary framework\nbased on existing standards guidelines\nand practices\nfor reducing cyber risks to critical\ninfrastructures\nthe cyber security enhancement act of\n2014\nreinforced nist's executive order 13636\nrole created through collaboration\nbetween industry and government\nthe voluntary framework consists of\nstandards guidelines and practices\nto promote the protection of critical\ninfrastructure the prioritized flexible\nrepeatable and cost-effective\napproach of the framework helps owners\nand operators of critical infrastructure\nto manage cyber security related risks\nnow according to section 7 of executive\norder\nthe secretary of commerce shall direct\nthe director\nof the national institute of standards\nand technology\ncould lead the development of a\nframework to reduce cyber risks\nto critical infrastructure the cyber\nsecurity framework shall include a set\nof standards\nmethodologies procedures and processes\nthat align policy business and\ntechnological approaches\nto address cyber risks the cyber\nsecurity framework\nshall incorporate voluntary consensus\nstandards and industry best practices\nto the fullest extent possible now let's\nsee why exactly do we need a cyber\nsecurity framework\nlet's tackle that question so the\nframework will help an organization\nbetter understand\nmanage and reduce its cyber security\nrisks\nit will assist in determining which\nactivities are most important to assure\ncritical operations and service delivery\nin turn that will help prioritize\ninvestments and maximize the impact of\neach dollar spent on cyber security\nit results in a shift from compliance to\naction and specifies outcomes\nby providing a common language to\naddress cybersecurity risk management\nit is especially helpful in\ncommunicating inside and outside the\norganization\nthat includes improving communications\nawareness and among it\nplanning and operating units as well as\nsenior executives of organizations\nit gives you a measure of where you are\nand where you need to go\nit can be implemented in stages or\ndegrees which make it more appealing to\nbusiness\nit has built-in maturity models and gap\nanalysis so you don't need additional\nmaturity models\non top of csf organizations also can\nreadily use\nthe framework to communicate current or\ndesired cybersecurity postures between a\nbuyer or supplier\nnow let's see what exactly is a cyber\nsecurity framework\nthe framework is voluntary guidance\nbased on existing standards\nguidelines and practices for\norganizations to better manage and\nreduce cybersecurity risks\nin addition to helping organizations\nmanage and reduce risks\nit was designed to foster risk and cyber\nsecurity management communications\namongst both internal and external\norganizational stakeholders\nnow let's see the types of cyber\nsecurity frameworks that we have\nso the first type of framework is pci\ndss\nwhich stands for payment card industry\nand data security standards\nit is a set of security control required\nto implement\nprotected payment account security it is\ndesigned to protect credit cards debit\ncards and cash card\ntransactions the second type of\nframework that we have\nis iso 2701 and 2702\nit is the international organization for\nstandardization\nnow the best practices recommendations\nfor information security management\nand information security program\nelements are from this framework\nthe third type of framework is cis which\nstands for critical security controls\na prescribed arrangement of activities\nfor cyber protection that gives\nparticular and noteworthy approaches to\nstop the present most inescapable and\nperilous attacks\na key advantage of the controls is that\nthey organize\nand center fewer activities with high\noutcomes\nlast but not the least we have the nist\nframework nist framework is made for\nimprovising\ncritical infrastructure cyber security\nwith the goal to improve\norganizations readiness for managing\ncyber security risk\nby leveraging standard methodologies and\nprocesses\nnow out of all the frameworks we just\ndiscussed nist is the most popular\nframework\nmist was developed in the february of\n2013 after the us presidential executive\norder\nit was designed to address national and\neconomic challenges\nand it is supposed to be voluntary at\nleast for private sectors\nnow let's discuss the objectives of the\nframework so the cyber security\nframeworks prioritized\nflexible and cost-effective approach\nhelps to promote the protection and\nresilience of critical infrastructure\nand other sectors important to the\neconomy and national security\nthe framework was developed to be\nadaptable flexible and scalable\nby an organization also it should\nimprove\norganizations readiness for managing\ncybersecurity risks\nthe framework was designed to be\nflexible and performance based\nand it should be cost effective it\nshould leverage standard and\nmethodologies and processes\nand should promote technological\nadvancement and innovation\nand it should be actionable across the\nenterprise focus on outcomes\nnow let's discuss the components of the\nnist cyber security framework\nthe cyber security framework consists of\nthree main components\nnamely the core implementation tires and\nprofiles\nthe framework core provides a set of\ndesired cyber security activities\nand outcomes using common language that\nis easy to understand\nthe core guides organizations in\nmanaging and reducing their cyber\nsecurity risks\nin a way that is complementing an\norganization's existing cybersecurity\nand risk management processes next we\nhave the framework implementation tiers\nwhich assists an organization by\nproviding context on how an organization\nviews cyber security risk management\nthe tiers guide organization to consider\nthe appropriate level of rigor\nfor the cyber security program and are\noften used as a communication tool\nto discuss the risk appetite mission\npriority and budget\nlast but not least is the framework\nprofiles which are an organization's\nunique alignment\nof their organizational requirements and\nobjectives\nrisk appetite and resources against the\ndesired outcomes of the framework core\nprofiles are primarily used to identify\nand prioritize opportunities\nfor improving cyber security at an\norganization\nlet's discuss the framework tires now\nthe tires describe the degree to which\nan organization's cyber security risk\nmanagement practices\nexhibit the characteristics defined in\nthe framework\nthe tires range from partial which is\ntime 1 to adaptive which is type 4 and\ndescribe an\nincreasing degree of rigor and how well\nintegrated cybersecurity risk decisions\nare into broader risk decisions and the\ndegree to which an organization shares\nand receives cybersecurity information\nfrom external parties\ntires do not necessarily represent\nmaturity levels organizations should\ndetermine the desired tire\nensuring that the selected level meets\norganizational goals\nreduces cyber security risks to the\nlevel acceptable by the organization\nand is feasible to implement fiscally\nand otherwise\nnext we have the core the core is a set\nof desired cyber security activities and\noutcomes organized into categories\nand aligned into informative references\nthe framework core is designed to be\nintuitive\nand to act as a translation layer to\nenable communication between\nmulti-disciplinary teams\nby using simplistic and non-technical\nlanguage the core consists of three\nparts\nfunctions categories and sub-categories\nthe core includes five\nhigh-level functions which is identify\nprotect\ndetect respond and recover these five\nfunctions are not only applicable to\ncyber security risk management\nbut also to risk management at a whole\nthe core asks an organization to\nidentify what processes\nand assets need to be protected now\nafter assessing that\nyou need to find what protection is\navailable then you need to find out what\ntechniques can identify the threats\nand what techniques can contain the\nimpact of an incident\nand finally the core defines what\ntechniques can restore the capabilities\nof the organization before the attack\nall right now let's dive deeper into the\nfunctions to see what these functions\nactually do\nand what purpose they solve so the\nfunctions are the highest level of\nabstraction\nincluded in the framework they act as\nthe backbone of the framework core\nthat all the other elements are\norganized around so the first function\nis identify\nit helps develop an organizational\nunderstanding to manage cybersecurity\nrisk\nto systems people assets data and\ncapabilities\nthe activities in the identify functions\nare foundational for effective use of\nthe framework\nunderstanding the business context the\nresources that support critical\nfunctions\nand related cyber security risks enable\nan organization to focus\nand prioritize its efforts consistent\nwith its risk management strategy\nexamples of outcome categories within\nthis function include asset management\nbusiness environment governance risk\nmanagement\nand risk assessment now the next type is\nthe protect function\nso to develop and implement appropriate\nsafeguards to ensure delivery of\ncritical services\nthe protect function supports the\nability to limit or contain the impact\nof a potential cyber security event\nexample of outcome categories within\nthis function include\nidentify management and access control\nawareness and training\ndata security information protection\nprocesses and procedures\nmaintenance and protective technology\nthe next kind of function is the detect\nfunction\nso this is used to develop and implement\nappropriate activities to identify\nthe occurrence of a cyber security event\nthe detect function enables timely\ndiscovery of cyber security events\nexample of outcome categories within\nthis function includes\nanomalies and events security continuous\nmonitoring\nand detection processes now next we have\nthe response function\nnow to develop and implement appropriate\nactivities to take action regarding a\ndetected cyber security incident\nthe response function supports the\nability to contain the impact of a\npotential cyber security incident\nthe outcomes category within this\nfunction includes response planning\ncommunications analysis mitigation and\nimprovements\nlast but not the least we have the\nrecover function now to develop\nand implement appropriate activities to\nmaintain plans for resilience\nand restore any capabilities or services\nthat were impaired due to a cyber\nsecurity incident\nthe recovery function supports timely\nrecovery to normal operations to reduce\nthe impact\nfrom a cyber security incident examples\nof outcome categories within this\nfunction include\nrecovery planning improvement and\ncommunications\nthese five functions were selected\nbecause they represent the five primary\npillars for a successful\nand holistic cyber security program they\naid organizations in easily expressing\ntheir management of cyber security risk\nat a high level and enabling risk\nmanagement decisions\nokay now let's understand the last\ncomponent of the nist framework\nnist recommends that the framework be\ncustomized in a way\nthat maximizes business value and that\ncustomization is referred to as a\nprofile\nprofiles are an organization's unique\nalignment of their organizational\nrequirements\nand objectives risk appetite and\nresources against the desired outcomes\nof the framework core profiles can be\nused to identify opportunities\nfor improving cyber security posture by\ncomparing a current profile with the\ntarget profile\nprofiles are about optimizing the cyber\nsecurity framework\nto best serve the organization the\nframework is voluntary\nso there is no right or wrong way to do\nit one way of approaching profiles is\nfor an\norganization to map their cyber security\nrequirements mission objectives\nand operating methodologies along with\nthe current practices\nagainst the sub-categories of the\nframework core to create a current state\nprofile\nthese requirements and objectives can be\ncompared against the current operating\nstate of the organization\nto gain an understanding of the gaps\nbetween the two\nnow the following steps illustrate how\nan organization could use the framework\nto create a new cyber security program\nor improve on an existing program these\nsteps should be repeated\nas necessary to continually improve\ncyber security\nso the first step is to prioritize and\nscope the organization identifies its\nbusiness mission\nobjectives and high level organizational\npriorities\nwith this information the organization\nmakes strategic decisions\nregarding cyber security implementations\nand determines the scope of systems and\nassets that support the selected\nbusiness line or process\nthe framework can be adapted to support\nthe different business lines\nor processes within an organization\nwhich may have different business needs\nand associated risk tolerance risk\ntolerances may be reflected in a target\nimplementation tier\nstep two is to orient yourself now once\nthe scope of cyber security program has\nbeen determined\nfor the business line or process the\norganization identifies related systems\nand assets regulatory requirements\nand overall risk approach the\norganization then consults\nsources to identify threats and\nvulnerabilities applicable to those\nsystems and assets\nso step three is to create a current\nprofile the organization develops a\ncurrent profile by indicating which\ncategory\nand subcategory outcomes from the\nframework core are currently being\nachieved\nif an outcome is partially achieved\nnoting this fact will help support\nsubsequent steps by providing baseline\ninformation the fourth step is to\nconduct a risk assessment\nthis assessment could be guided by\norganizations overall risk management\nprocess\nor previous risk assessment activities\nthe organization analyzes the\noperational environment\nin order to discern the likelihood of a\ncyber security event\nand the impact that the event could have\non the organization\nit is important that the organization\nidentify emerging risks\nand use cyber threats information from\ninternal and external sources to gain a\nbetter understanding\nof the likelihood and impact of cyber\nsecurity events\nso the fifth step is to create a target\nprofile the organization creates a\ntarget profile that focuses on the\nassessment of the framework categories\nand subcategories describing the\norganization's desired cyber security\noutcomes\norganizations may also develop their own\nadditional categories and subcategories\nto account for unique organizational\nrisks\nthe organization may also consider\ninfluences and requirements of external\nstakeholders\nsuch as sector entities customers and\nbusiness partners when creating a target\nprofile\nthe target profile should appropriately\nreflect criteria within the target\nimplementation tier\nthe sixth step is to determine analyze\nand prioritize gaps\nthe organization compares the current\nprofile and the target profile to\ndetermine gaps\nnext it creates a prioritized action\nplan to address gaps\nreflecting mission drivers costs and\nbenefits and risks\nto achieve outcomes in the target\nprofile the organization then determines\nresources including funding\nand workforce necessary to address the\ngaps using profiles in this manner\nencourages the organization to make\ninformed decisions about cyber security\nactivities\nsupport risk management and enables the\norganization to perform cost effective\ntargeted improvement\nthe last step is to implement action\nplan the organization determines which\nactions to take to address the gaps\nif any identified in the previous step\nand then adjust\nits current cyber security practices to\nachieve the target profile\nfor further guidance the framework\nidentifies examples\ninformative reference regarding the\ncategories and subcategories\nbut organizations should determine which\nstandards guidelines and practices\nincluding those that are sector specific\nwork best for their needs\nan organization repeats the steps as\nneeded to continuously assess and\nimprove its cyber security\nfor instance organizations may find that\nmore frequent repetition of orient step\nimproves the quality of risk assessment\nfurthermore\norganizations may monitor progress\nthrough iterative updates\nto the current profile subsequently\ncomparing the current profile to the\ntarget profile\norganizations may also use this process\nto align their cybersecurity program\nwith their desired framework\nimplementation tier now the framework\nhelps guide\nkey decision points about the risk\nmanagement activities through the\nvarious levels of an organization\nfor supporting risk management now as\nyou can see in the picture\nit describes a common flow of\ninformation and decisions at the\nfollowing levels within an organization\nthe levels are executive business\nprocess and implementations or\noperations the executive level\ncommunicates mission priorities\navailable resources and overall risk\ntolerance to business process levels\nthe business or process level uses the\ninformation as input into the risk\nmanagement process\nand then collaborates with the\nimplementation or operation level to\ncommunicate business needs\nand create a profile the implementation\nor operation level\nthe implementation or operations level\ncommunicates the profile implementation\nprogress to the business level\nthe business level uses this information\nto perform an impact assessment\nnext the business level management\nreports the outcomes of that\nimpact assessment to the executive level\nto inform the organization's overall\nrisk management process and to the\nimplementation operation levels for\nawareness of business impact\nokay guys that was it from me for the\ntopic\nof cyber security frameworks we\ndiscussed how nist has actually changed\nthe whole cyber security environment\nsince it was released in the february of\n2013\ni hope you all learned something\nvaluable that's it from me goodbye\nyou\n",
