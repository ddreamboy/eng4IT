  "text": "hello everyone welcome to this session\nof blockchain wallet my name is saurav\nand i'm part of the simply learn team so\nlet's get started and let's see what's\nin store for us today so what's in it\nfor you today we're gonna understand why\ndo we need blockchain wallet what is a\nblockchain wallet how do these wallet\nwork what are the different types of\nblockchain wallets their comparisons and\ndemo on the usage of these blockchain\nwallets and we will try to do certain\ntransactions using these wallets now\nbefore these blockchain wallets came\ninto existence what were the means in\norder for us to do the transactions and\nwhat were the drawbacks in the old days\nthe transactions with whatever medium\nand channels we had the problems were\nthat the transactions were slow and\nbanks were the central point of failure\nbasically any transaction which has to\ngo through has to go through some\nintermediary channels and has to pass\nthrough certain intermediaries like bank\nwhich makes them a single point of\nfailure also there are issues in keeping\ntrack of all accounts and balances data\nget jeopardized manipulated or even get\ncorrupted across\nmultiple systems where the accounts and\nbalances are maintained now here comes\ninto existence what is called as\nblockchain wallet now what is blockchain\nwallet a blockchain wallet is a\ncryptocurrency wallet that allows users\nto manage different kind of\ncryptocurrencies for example bitcoin\nethereum etc now a blockchain wallet\nhelps exchanging of funds easily\ntransactions are secure as they are\ncryptographically signed the wallet is\naccessible from web or mobile devices\nand the privacy and identity of the user\nis maintained so therefore a blockchain\nwallet provides all the features which\nare necessary for a safe and secure\ntransfer and exchange of funds between\ndifferent parties a blockchain wallet is\na typical cryptocurrency wallet that\nallows users to manage cryptocurrencies\nit is very similar to the process of\nsending or receiving money through\npaypal or any other gateway which you\nuse today but now you can use\ncryptocurrency instead similar to paypal\nwhich you're using for making\ntransactions with your fiat currency now\nlet's take a look at the ecosystem of\nblockchain wallets here are certain\nexamples like electrum blockchain.info\njaxx mycelium samurai and bitcoin paper\nwallet these are just to name a few\nblockchain wallets which are existing in\nthe market but there are many more based\non the requirement you have based on the\nsecurity you require and based on the\nkind of wallet which suffices your need\nso we will see what are the\ncategorizations of these kind of wallets\nare now how do blockchain wallets work\nlet's take a look so before we move on\nto how blockchain wallets work let's\nunderstand what a private and a public\nkey is and how are these keys related to\na blockchain wallet now whenever you\ncreate a blockchain wallet you are also\nprovided a private and a public key\nwhich is associated with your wallet now\nlet's take an example in order to\nunderstand this imagine a person knowing\nyour email address is sending you an\nemail so in our regular day-to-day\nactivity if we want to receive an email\nfrom someone we give him or her our\nemail id and expect an email from them\nnow what if an unknown person is able to\nsend emails through my account so i am\ngiving my email address for receiving\nemail but when i am disclosing my email\nid i am not assuming that someone will\nbe able to send emails through my\naccount because then for that he has to\nbe aware of my email account password so\nknowing your email address will not give\na person the ability to send an email\nfrom your account you are not giving\nyour password to the person to send an\nemail you are just giving the email\naddress to send an email from a\nparticular email address an individual\nhas to be aware of the password\nassociated with it now blockchain wallet\nfollows a similar process using public\nkey and private key both together public\nkey is similar to your email address so\nbasically whenever your wallet is\ngenerated a public key is generated you\ncan share that public key with anyone in\norder to receive funds private key is\ntop secret it's similar to your password\nit should not get hacked or you should\nnot disclose it to anyone and you use\nthis private key to spend your funds so\nnow instead of sending an email imagine\nyou want to transfer money to your\nfriend this transfer process is done\nthrough your blockchain wallet with\nblockchain wallets you can now send and\nreceive cryptocurrencies so as i said a\nblockchain wallet has two keys a public\nkey and a private key public key is\nshared with everyone just like an email\naddress private key is just like your\npassword which should be kept secret\nwith the sender so with blockchain\nwallet no one will be able to send\ncrypto coins just like emails through\nyour public key until they know your\nprivate key but if someone gets access\nto your private key there is a high\npossibility that your account is hacked\nand you might end up losing all the\ncryptocurrency deposits in your account\nnow let's take a look what are the\ntypical features of a blockchain wallet\nit's easy to use it's just like any\nother software or a wallet which you use\nfor your day-to-day transactions it is\nhighly secure it is just a matter of you\nsecuring your private key and it allows\ninstant transactions across geographies\nbarrier-free without intermediaries and\nalso these transactions charges you low\ncost fee and these wallets help you do\ntransactions across multiple\ncryptocurrencies so you can make\npayments across cryptocurrencies which\nhelps you do easy currency conversions\nnow let's talk about what are the\ndifferent type of blockchain wallets now\nbasically there are two types of\nblockchain wallets based on the private\nkeys one is hot wallet and another is\nthe cold wallet hot wallets are like\nnormal wallets which we carry for\nday-to-day transactions and these\nwallets are user-friendly cold wallets\ncold wallets are similar to a vault\nwhere cryptocurrencies are stored with a\nhigh level of security now let's take a\nlook at the differences hot wallets are\nonline wallets through which\ncryptocurrencies can be transferred\nquickly they are available online on\ninternet example coinbase\nblockchain.info cold wallets they are\ndigital offline wallets where the\ntransactions are signed offline and then\nlater disclosed online so they are not\nmaintained on the cloud on the internet\nthey are maintained offline to have high\nsecurity and the examples of cold wallet\nare trezor and ledger now in case of hot\nwallets private keys are stored in the\ncloud for faster transfer in case of\ncold wallets private keys are stored in\na separate hardware which are\ndisconnected from the internet or the\ncloud or are stored in a paper-based\ndocument hot wallet they are easy to\naccess available online 24 7. it can be\naccessed through desktop or mobile but\nhas a risk of unrecoverable theft when\nhacked cold wallets this method of\ntransaction helps in protecting the\nwallet from unauthorized access from\nhacking and other online vulnerabilities\nnow the wallet can be further\ndistinguished on these criterias there\ncan be software wallets they can be\nhardware wallets which are like kind of\nusb driven and you plug into your usb\ndrive and your hardware wallet can be\nused or they are a typical paper based\nwallet where you print your public key\nand a private key on a paper and keep it\nin a secure place let's talk about\nsoftware wallet a software wallet is an\napplication that is downloaded on a\ndevice either it could be a desktop or a\nmobile or it could be a web-based wallet\nwhich can be accessed online now here\nare certain examples dax bread wallet\nand copay are the popular software\nwallets so software wallet can be\nfurther categorized into desktop wallet\nonline or we can call it web wallets or\nmobile wallets now desktop wallets are\nlike cold wallets in which the private\nkeys are stored in cold servers\nbasically the desktop wallets the\nprivate keys are stored in your desktop\nyou can unplug it from the internet do\nsome offline transactions and then bring\nit back online now in case the main\nserver is lost then a cold server\nbasically a desktop is used as a backup\nserver these wallets can be downloaded\non any computer but can only be accessed\nfrom the system they are installed on so\nyou make sure the desktop or the machine\non which you i have downloaded the\ndesktop wallet is safe has a backup\nyou're maintaining the hardware you're\nnot letting the machine go anywhere and\nit is on a secure location now these\nwallets are definitely cost efficient\nand one of the examples is electrum and\nis one of the most popular desktop\nwallet online wallets are the other kind\nof hot wallets that run on the cloud\nthat are available on the internet now\nhere users have the benefit of accessing\nthese wallets across any device it could\nbe tablet desktop or you can use it from\nyour mobile browser the private keys are\nstored online and are managed by a third\nparty you have to be dependent on a\nthird party service now for example\ngreen address is a bitcoin wallet which\nis available on the web has an android\napp is available on a desktop and also\nis available on ios apple mobile wallets\nmobile wallets are like similar to\nonline wallets except that they are\nbuilt only for mobile phone usage and\naccessibility these wallets are also\nuser-friendly and they have a\nuser-friendly interface for which helps\nyou in doing transactions easily the\nexample is mycelium which is the best\navailable mobile wallet hardware wallet\nhardware wallet is a type of cold\nstorage device typically like a usb\nwhich stores the user's private key in a\nprotected hardware device these wallets\nare similar to portable devices that can\nbe connected to the computer can be\nplugged in as i said earlier it is less\nprone to malware attacks malicious\nattacks and it is hack proof examples\nare nanoledger trezor and kiki are the\ntop hardware wallets available in the\nmarket to make a transaction from your\nhardware wallet you have to ensure the\nhardware wallet is plugged into your\ncomputer system before you can do a\ntransaction from your hardware wallet\npaper wallet a paper wallet is an\noffline process for storing\ncryptocurrencies this wallet is a\nprinted paper consisting of both your\nprivate key and a public key which are\naccessed using a qr code now since these\nwallets are safe they are widely used\nfor storing large amount of\ncryptocurrencies now for example our\nbitcoin paper wallet and myetherwallet\nare one of the widely used paper wallets\nbut the question arises how do i add\ncryptocurrency in my paper wallet in\norder to make a transaction with your\npaper wallet paper wallet works with\nyour software wallets the online wallets\nto transfer funds from your software\nwallet to the public address shown on\nyour paper wallet so basically first you\npark your funds in a software wallet\nthen you transfer the funds from your\nsoftware wallet to the public address\nprinted on your paper wallet now let's\ndo the comparison blocked in info\nblockchain info is a cryptocurrency\nwallet which supports bitcoin and\nethereum it is easy to use and has a low\ntransaction fee it has its apis exposed\nyou can easily use them to order to make\nyour own custom wallets also ledger nano\nledger nano is a hardware wallet which\noffers a high security to your account\nit is available for bitcoin ethereum and\nlitecoin users it is also possible to\nmaintain multiple accounts and access\nthem anytime bitcoin paper wallet paper\nwallet helps you to print your own\ntamper resistant bitcoin wallet it\nminimizes the threat of hacking jacks\njax is a software wallet which enables a\nuser to exchange currencies within the\nwallet it is available for bitcoin\nethereum litecoin and many other\ncryptocurrencies with jax a user can\nview his updated balance as soon as the\nprocessing is complete now let's take a\nlook at certain demos for the different\nkind of wallets we have talked about so\nlet's first take an example of paper\nwallet so bit address dot org provides\nyou a paper wallet it uses the\nclient-side javascript in order to\ngenerate a random hash for your wallet\nso you keep moving your mouse and it\nwill generate a hash public and private\nkey it is recommended that when you are\ndoing this process you should be\ndisconnected from the internet and once\nthese keys are generated you can print\nit and keep it secure and clear the\ncache of your browser so as you can see\non the screen this is my public key for\nreceiving my bitcoins and this is the\nprivate key for me to spend it i can\nprint it and keep it handy with me but\nof course the safety of these physical\ndocuments cannot be entirely guaranteed\nif a hacker discovers the location of\nyour paper wallet and physically steals\nit then they can access your bitcoin\nholdings so basically it is of high\nimportance that you keep the paper\nwallet in a very very secure location\nsome users hide or disguise the paper\nwallet it should be protected from\nphysical damage if the keys fade or can\nno longer be scanned then the user will\nnever again be able to access the\nbitcoin which are parked in that address\nalso take care if you are using an\nincorrect type of printer that also may\ndamage the paper wallet\nnow let's take a look for our second\nexample of online wallet here we are\ntaking an example of bitpay so you can\ndownload bitpay online and create your\naccount over here\nyou can create a personal wallet you can\ncreate a shared wallet or a joint share\nwallet once you create a wallet like if\nyou see the example over here this is my\npersonal wallet and i have 3.645\ntest bitcoins over here\nnow in order to receive test bitcoins in\nmy account you can receive these test\nbitcoins from testnet dot coin faucet\ndot eu's hyphen in\nnow in order to receive it you just need\nto\ncopy\nyour bitcoin address\nin the testnet address\nso the test net has given me 0.87\nbitcoin so now my balance has increased\nfrom 3.5 to 3.64 and i can see this\ntransaction\nsee three minutes ago i just received\n0.872287 bitcoin the transaction is\nstill in process but in a while as this\ntransaction is getting mined on the test\nnet i will receive it now as i have\nreceived it i can even make a\ntransaction and send it to someone\nso from my personal account i can send\nbitcoin to\nsomeone whose bitcoin address i have and\ni have to just paste it over here\ntransfer to bitcoin wallet either i can\nselect one of my own wallets or i can\nsearch for any other bitcoin address\nwhich someone has shared with me and i\ncan send it to that particular address\nnow let's take an example of our\nhardware wallet how does hardware wallet\nworks with the online wallets so here we\nhave metamask which has a feature of\nconnecting with hardware wallet so once\nyou have metamask installed you will see\nthis option of connect hardware wallet\nnow metamask has provided support for\ntrezor so now once you connect your\nhardware wallet the usb with your\ncomputer you can select an account you\nwant to view on that particular hardware\nwallet and you can only choose one at a\ntime and then you can start using that\nparticular wallet for your decentralized\napps so basically once you have your\nhardware connected it is integrated with\nyour metamask and then you can start\nrunning your decentralized apps so that\nthey can start using the tokens or the\ncurrency in the particular hardware\nwallet so use your hardware account like\nyou would with any ethereum account\nlogin to dapps and send ethereums buy\nand store erc20 tokens and non-fungible\ntokens like cryptokitties so if you\nclick connect to trezor over here\nmetamask will start looking out for the\nconnected trezor device so i hope you\nall had a great learning session and\ni'll meet you in my next session thank\nyou very much\nhi there if you like this video\nsubscribe to the simply learn youtube\nchannel and click here to watch similar\nvideos turn it up and get
