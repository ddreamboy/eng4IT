  "text": "this is a cat\nyou know that\neveryone watching this video knows that\neven a toddler will point to this photo\nand call it a cat\nwell not necessarily\nsometimes children mix up cats and dogs\nespecially if they weren't exposed to\ndifferent breeds or colors or sizes of\nanimals before but as soon as they've\nseen enough cats and dogs and other\nfurry friends they've learned the\ndifference\nwe apply similar logic when helping\nmachines understand the visual world\nthis technology helps autonomous\nvehicles avoid pedestrians and other\ncars as well as react to road signs and\nthat's how computer models can locate\ntumors in mri images with up to 90\npercent accuracy\nthe image recognition skill allows\ncomputers to process more information\nthan the human eye often faster and more\naccurately or simply when people are not\ninvolved in looking\nso how can machines see and interpret\nthe visual world\nwell let's talk about computer vision\nand its applications\n[Music]\nin the first three years of our lives we\ncreate one million neural connections\nper second whenever we learn something\nnew a neuron in our brain lights up with\nan electrical impulse and sends the\nmessage about a new experience to other\nneurons forming connections everything\nwe know is shaped by these neural\nconnections networks of them whenever we\nsee a new type of cat the same\nconnection strengthens making it easier\nfor us to recognize an animal as a cat\nnext time\nwith machines we use similar neural\nnetworks but those networks are\nartificial\njust a disclaimer we will be using\nsimplified explanations and formulas to\nmake concepts more digestible\nan artificial neural network is an\nadvanced machine learning algorithm that\ncan answer questions without any hints\nfrom humans questions like how much will\nit cost to fix a car or a roof after the\ndisaster tractable uses ai to study the\nphotos taken by insurance clients to\nevaluate how much should be reimbursed\nand in this demo nvidia applies image\nrecognition to satellite imagery to\ndetect destruction of homes in the\nwoolsely fire in 2018.\nthe neural network looks for specific\nfeatures that it knows must represent\ndamage and it does so by doing math\na neural net consists of many layers an\ninput layer that receives the data\nthe output layer that makes the final\nforecast\nand the hidden layers where the magic\nhappens\nlayers consist of nodes neurons that are\nall interconnected each neuron is\nperforming a computation\njust like biological neurons receive\nsignals about the world artificial ones\nreceive data\nthe difference it's represented in a\nformat understood by computers numbers\nfor images it's the color values of the\npixels composing the image\nneurons in the input layer are not that\nimportant because they simply receive\ndata and pass it on so let's focus on\nthis node in one of the hidden layers\nconnected to many nodes in the previous\nlayer it accepts one number from each\nnode but it doesn't treat all these\nconnections equally they have different\nimportance or weights also represented\nas numbers the higher the weight the\nmore influence one node has on another\nso a node multiplies inputs by their\ncorresponding weights and then adds them\nall up to create a single number this\nnumber will become an input for the\nnodes in the next layer\nso the weights basically help the net\nlook for the data that carries the\ngreatest importance for the task and\nlayer upon layer recognize more of the\ndetails until the last node puts it all\ntogether and says here are all the areas\nhit by hail\nyes an experienced evaluator can also do\nthis kind of job manually but they will\nhave to travel to the affected zone and\ninspect large areas immensely extending\nthe claim processing time but a computer\ncan analyze data from photos without\nworkers moving around and wasting\nprecious time\nof course it doesn't have to be just\nstatic images amazon incorporated neural\nnetworks to develop one of its most\ngroundbreaking products amazon go stores\nevery part of their unique just walk out\nexperience is run by computer vision\ncameras and sensors keep track of every\nperson entering the store and what\nthey're doing whether picking up an item\nor returning it to the shelf at the same\ntime every product sold at the store is\ntracked by cameras too is it on the\nshelf or in someone's hand\nand finally those two instances are\ncombined to answer the ultimate question\nwhich person took what product\nwith almost 30 locations in the u.s and\nnow a shop in london the automated\nstores are no longer a concept but the\nretail reality as amazon starts\nproviding the technology to whole foods\ntesco and starbucks\nthis way computer vision is transforming\nthe way offline shopping works any\nvisual data that can provide useful\ninformation can be processed by machines\nsaving time money and providing\ncompetitive advantage\nthis was the basic principle that all\nneural nets work by but they can be\ndifferent too\nfor image recognition tasks\nconvolutional neural networks are used\nthe most they were specifically created\nto work with two-dimensional image data\nand are extremely good at locating\nimportant features of objects\nhere's how convolutional neural networks\nwork\ncomputers see images as grids of pixels\nas you may know each pixel is\nrepresented and encoded as a combination\nof red green and blue of different\nintensity here's what a computer sees\nwhen you input this picture\nlet's switch it to grayscale and reduce\nthe resolution for simplicity\nfrom this color intensity map alone the\ncomputer must determine how many cars\nare parked in the parking lot this\ninformation can be used to optimize\nprice or redirect traffic to less\npopulated areas\nthis will get a bit math heavy so be\nprepared\nin a convolutional neural network we do\nalmost the same thing the normal neural\nnetwork does but instead of multiplying\none pixel value by its weight we\nmultiply a patch of pixels by a set of\nweights called a filter or a kernel\nthis is done because in images the\ndifference between neighboring pixel\nvalues is important pixels with low\nvalues are darker while high values are\nlighter if the contrasting pixels are\nlocated close together it's a good\nindication that we're looking at an\nobject's outline\nso we multiply this patch of pixels by\nthe filter and receive one pixel\nthe filter moves across the image patch\nby patch until it transforms the whole\npicture so the convolutional neural net\nnot only extracts value from the image\nbut also reduces its dimension making it\neasier to process\ndepending on what features we want the\nmachine to find we apply a specific\nfilter\nthey're like templates helping bring out\nneeded features\nthis one can pinpoint the outlines other\nkernels can filter out horizontal or\nvertical lines there are kernels for\nfinding faces and separate face features\nokay but how does a computer know which\nweights to multiply by we're glad you're\ncatching on because this is kind of a\ncrucial part neural networks learn those\nweights during the training process\nwant to know how to train a deep\nlearning model\nlet's start with something familiar how\ndo humans see\nwell to be honest we don't know for sure\nhow our brains apply meaning to the\nvisuals around us the most popular\ntheory is pattern recognition it states\nthat we rely on patterns or features to\nfigure out what objects we're seeing\na cat has its set of characteristics a\nlong tail\nfur and big pointy ears to start with\nbut we don't teach our children about\ncats by listing all those\ncharacteristics to them we show them\npictures because it's easier and allows\nfor much more flexibility\nthis and this are both cats even though\nthey're different in many ways but a\nchild is capable of catching all the\nthings features that are common in them\nso we do the same thing with machines we\nshow them pictures tell them what's in\nthem and hope they figure out all the\nimportant features by themselves\nsay you want to build an app that will\ncalculate the probability of pneumonia\nfrom x-ray images similar to the one we\nprototype for decision making in the\nhospital setting\nas we already established you can't\nsimply tell the computer what disease\nlooks like on a radiograph moreover you\nwant to distinguish between different\nconditions\nso the best approach is to give the\ncomputer a vast amount of labeled chest\nx-rays to extract valuable features on\nits own\nthis is one of over 112 000 training\nimages we use for our pneumonia scenario\nits pixel map is fed to the input layer\nwhich performs convolution except this\ntime all filter values are random\ncompletely incidental the results are\npassed to outgoing layers where they're\nmultiplied and added many times before\narriving at the output layer there the\nresulting output is compared to the\ndesired one in case of an error the\nsystem starts tweaking weights over and\nover until it gives a correct result the\nprocess of training is basically finding\nappropriate weights from the constant\nfeedback loop\nthis video might not look like much but\nhere an aerospace manufacturer airbus is\nmaking aviation history in this\ndemonstration they present a new\nautonomous technology that will soon\nassist pilots of commercial flights in\ntaxiing takeoffs and landings\nnotice the pilot nervously hovering a\nhand over the stick while the aircraft\nsoars into the sky on its own accord\nairbus uses cameras sensors and software\npowered by computer vision to let the\njet navigate the runway independently\nand take off at the appropriate time in\nharsh weather conditions pilots will\nhave to manually correct the plane but\nin ideal circumstances like this they\ncan delegate such operations to the\ncomputer and get busy with navigational\ntasks and communication\non the ground the transformation\npromises to be even more drastic\ncurrently over 6 000 pedestrians die in\ntraffic accidents every year in the u.s\na number that increased by almost 50\npercent since 2010. over 90 percent of\ncollisions happen due to drivers getting\ndistracted\nbut if we remove human error from the\nequation we can significantly improve\nroad safety\nin the first quarter of 2021 tesla\nvehicles operating with autopilot became\nengaged in a single road accident for\nevery 4.19 million miles driven in the\nsame period tesla cars not using\nautopilot experienced one accident for\nevery 978 000 miles traveled so it seems\nlike self-driving tesla cars can be four\ntimes safer than the ones operated by a\nregular human driver even though people\nare wary of autonomous cars stats speak\nfor themselves tireless and watchful\nautopilots are projected to make roads\nsafer and more walkable as we inevitably\nmove towards the autonomous future\none of the most popular uses of computer\nvision is facial recognition the unique\narchitecture of our faces allows\nmachines to perform fantastically\naccurate face matching to validate our\nidentity or find missing persons\nsince the launch of their facial\nrecognition system in 2016 interpol\nidentified almost 1500 terrorists\ncriminals persons of interest and\nmissing people\nthese applications are our triumph in a\ndecades-long effort to make computers\nsee the same way we do\nthat said it's not always that positive\nit's one thing when technology tracks\nhumans on the road but a completely\ndifferent one when it recognizes their\nidentities logs details about their\npersonal lives or classifies\nmarginalized groups to mistreat them\ndeep fakes can be entertaining in one\ncontext while harmful and destructive in\nothers\nshockingly accurate face search engines\nare available both to those who want to\nstop misuse of their pictures and to\nthose who want to stalk other people\nthis is a common dilemma that almost\nevery technology becomes subject to\nshould we stall the progress to protect\nour privacy it seems that computer\nvision has advanced too far and promises\ntoo many benefits to have us ever choose\nto stop progress in its tracks our job\nhere is to provide regulations and rules\nto make sure that progress and ethics go\nhand in hand\n[Music]\nyou\n",
