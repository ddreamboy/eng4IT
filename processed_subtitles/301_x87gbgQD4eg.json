  "text": "you want to know how bad you are at\nsecurity in this video i'm going to show\nyou one of the best tools at discovering\nsecurity vulnerabilities\nso that you can be more prepared for a\njob in cyber security\nbut first if this is the first time that\nwe're meeting welcome to my channel\nmy name is john good and here i get to\nspread my passion for cyber security\ntraining\ntips and tricks and career advice to\nhelp you go further\nremember to smash the thumbs up to like\nthis video hit the subscribe button and\nthe bell icon so you don't miss future\ncontent\nand make sure

interruptions\nor advertisements make sure that you\nalso sign up for my newsletter\nusing the link in the description to get\nyour free copy of my ebook\non cyber security careers you can also\njoin me on the discord server the link\nis in the description\nalright let's get into the video when\nwas the last time that you had to\ninstall\nupdates on your computer one of the\nthings that will always be consistent in\nsecurity\nis that new bugs and vulnerabilities are\nfound every day\nbeing able to identify vulnerabilities\nor weaknesses in our networks\nand track them throughout their life\ncycle until they're resolved\nis crucial to keeping a network secure\nafter all attackers have the same\nbulletins\nand vulnerability release information\nthat we do so it becomes a race to fix\nthat vulnerability\nbefore an attacker can exploit it have\nyou ever heard of the cis controls\nthe cis controls are critical controls\nthat an organization\nneeds to secure their network continuous\nvulnerability management\nhappens to be the number three critical\ncontrol that an organization has to have\non their network\nif you haven't heard of the top 20\ncontrols what you can do is go to\nciisecurity.org\nand they have a list of all the\ndifferent controls if you want to look\nmore into this\nbut right here at number three we have\ncontinuous\nvulnerability management let's be honest\nas you'll begin to see the vulnerability\nmanagement life cycle\ncan take a lot of time and resources in\norder to be successful\nwe have to know the systems that we have\non our networks then we have to go scan\nthose systems and identify\nvulnerabilities\nwe have to determine the vulnerability\nseverity\nso how likely it is to be exploited and\nthen we actually have to track that\nvulnerability\nthrough its remediation luckily there's\ncommercial tools that exist to assist us\nin the vulnerability management process\nin this particular video\nwe're going to cover nessus which is a\npopular vulnerability scanning tool\nnessus has two different components that\nmake it actually work\nfirst we have the client and this refers\nto that web interface that we actually\nuse\nas the administrators or users and we\ncan interact with the system\nthe schedule scans generate reports and\nall kinds of other features\nthe other component is the server\ncomponent this is what actually performs\nthose scans\nand then it sends the results over to\nthe web interface or the client\nwith vulnerability scanning there's four\nmajor steps\nthe first step is port scanning this is\nwhere the scanner is going to actually\ngo out there determine which hosts are\nalive\nand which ports are open on those hosts\nthen we have service detection\nthis is where nessus is going to send\nout probes to find out which\napplication is running on that port the\nversion number\nand the actual name of it then we have\nvulnerability identification\nthis is where nessus is going to compare\nwhat it discovers about each service\ndetected on each host\nand then it's going to actually compare\nit against its database\nof known vulnerabilities of those\napplications and version numbers\nand then finally we have the probing\nstep this is where nessus is\nactually going to try to further\nidentify if there's false positives\nor identify if that vulnerability\nactually exists\nnow that we know some of the basics\nabout vulnerability management and\nvulnerability scanning\ni want to actually take you through the\nnessus product by installing it\nand running some scans so you can\nactually see what it looks like\nfor this demo we're going to be using\nthe free non-commercial use\nlicense that you can also use at home if\nyou want to practice along\nbefore we get started i want to make\nsure that we're on the same page as far\nas a disclaimer\nso everybody say it with me i will not\nscan\nnetworks that i do not have written\npermission\nto scan okay we agree\nif you scan networks that you do not\nhave permission\nto scan you can actually get into a lot\nof legal trouble\nso make sure that you're only scanning\nsystems that you have permission to scan\nall right so let's go over to the\ncomputer now so we can install nessus\nso the first thing that you're going to\nwant to do is go to google\nand search for nessus\nand nessus is made by tenable which is\nthe producing company here\nwe'll click this first link\nand the nessus essentials is the one\nthat we're actually going to use for our\nhome use\nyou can see that there's a few other\noptions that you would use in an actual\ncorporate environment\nwe'll scroll down here and we'll go to\ndownload\nso you will have to actually register to\nget an activation code from them\nso i will go ahead and do this and then\ni'll check back in once we enter our\ninformation\nit will take us to the download page and\nthen we just have to pick the version\nthat we want to use\naccept the terms and go ahead install\ni am running centos here so yours might\nlook different depending on which\noperating system you're running\nbut again we're going to install it\ni'll enter my password here\nand now that we have it installed we\nneed to go ahead and start it\nup here so i already have a command\nprompt window open back here\nand so i will change to root\nand start the service\nall right great so nessus is started now\nso when you're actually going to connect\nto nessus after you've installed it\nyou need to go to your local host and\nthen port 8834 is the website you'll get\nthis\nerror because it doesn't have an\nofficial signed certificate\nso hit advanced\nand then add exception and confirm\nsecurity exception\nnow we'll be brought to this webpage\nwhere we need to select our specific\nversion\nagain we did nessus essentials so\ncontinue\nand then we already have an activation\ncode so\nwe can skip this step and we'll enter\nour activation\nin here so i'm going to enter mine in\nand then hit continue\nand then i'll check back in once we're\ndone with that now that we've entered\nour activation code we need to create a\nuser account\nso i'm going to create the username root\nand the password will be super secret\nand then hit submit\nnow this account is the account that\nyou'll log into when you need to run a\nscan\nwhat it's going to do now is it's going\nto go ahead and download the plugins\nit's going to update itself\nso that we have all the available\nsignatures\nand the most up-to-date database for\nwhen we perform our scans\nso we will let this run and then we'll\ncheck back in once we're done with that\nall right and now we have successfully\ninstalled\nnessus to our local system with the\nnessus essential license\ni hope that you're enjoying the content\nin this video so far\nif you are make sure to hit the thumbs\nup to like this video\nand if you think of any questions let me\nknow down in the comment section below\nalso remember that this training and\nfull courses can be found on my website\nat johngood.com without distracting\ninterruptions\nor advertisements all right let's get\nback to the content\nso now that we've installed nessus the\nfirst thing that we need to do\nis we need to actually run a discovery\nscan it's called\nand this is going to discover all the\nhosts on our network\nso i'm actually only going to scan the\nlocalhost\nbecause that's this system right now\nthat i'm running this on\nso i'll enter the ip address and hit\nsubmit\nand nessus will go ahead and scan for\npotential hosts\nit finds my host so if we used a full\nnetwork\nor mini host then it would obviously\nlist them in here\nbut again with this home license you\nonly have a 16 host limit\nthat you can scan and then we will hit\nrun scan\nall right and this is going to do a\nbasic network scan\nall right now that scan is complete so\nwe can actually drill down\ninto the different vulnerabilities that\nit found\nit will tell you some of the information\nearly on before it actually finishes\nso you can look at the information\nbefore it finishes\nbut you can see here that we have this\nnice pie chart here\n92 percent of the findings were\ninformational\nsix percent were medium two percent were\nlow\nso if we want to drill down into that we\ncan go up here and click the\nvulnerabilities\nand it will tell us the individual\nissues\nso we're going to go into this http\nissue here\nand we can see there's a medium\nvulnerability and we're going to click\non that one\nyou can see that it gives more\ninformation about that individual\nvulnerability\nand what it found so in this particular\none\nthis remote web server supports the\ntrace and or track methods\nwith this i just installed a default\ninstallation of apache\nso it's going to have some of these\nregular default findings\nin this vulnerability finding you can\nalso see this output so it gives more\ninformation about it\nand you also get some article links you\ncan go check out as well\nthe medium rating or the medium risk is\nbased on\nwhat nessus believes it is okay\nso that's where that medium comes from\nthen you also\nget modified and the published date\nso you can see when they updated the\nsignature\nand just a little bit more information\nyou also get the port that it was found\non\nso adtcp www and the host that it was\nfound on so again localhost\nthis system that i'm actually running it\non now you also get\nsome of these cves over here as well so\nif i click on this original one go ahead\nand open that in a different window\nthat will take us to the actual database\nwhere it describes its findings\nand i definitely would check this out\nthis is going to be a great database\nwhere you have a lot of different\ninformation this is the nist\nnvd website and this has all the\ndifferent\nvulnerabilities that are out there oh\nand again\nthat was found for the specific\nvulnerability the specific\ncve you found it on the actual\nvulnerability finding\nit links directly to it when you're\nlooking for more vulnerability\ninformation\nyou can also go to the vendor website\nbecause of course they're going to\nrelease\nwhen there's a new patch and potential\nsecurity issues\nand that's in addition to what we can\nuse on the scanner\nand that national vulnerability database\nwhich is that website i showed you\nby nist question of the day what are\nsome alternative tools to nessus\nor vulnerability management that exist\nout there i want you to actually go out\nand do some research\nand let me know down in the comment\nsection below what some of these\nalternative tools are\nin this video we walk through the\ninstallation operation\nand reporting in the nessus\nvulnerability scanning tool\nwe also went through different ways that\nyou can research\nvulnerabilities their severity and ways\nto actually mitigate them\nor remove them from our environments\nremember vulnerability management is a\nvery\ntime-consuming and ongoing process that\nonly works when we can track the\nvulnerabilities that exist\nthrough their mitigation or when we\nactually eliminate them from our\nnetworks\nas always make sure to leave a like\ncomment and subscribe check out my\nwebsite at johngood.com for more\ntraining without distracting\ninterruptions\nor advertisements and i'll see you next\n[Music]\ntime\n[Music]\nyou\n",
