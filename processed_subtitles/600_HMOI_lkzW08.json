  "text": "that quest is the best if you don't\nthink so then we have different opinions\nhello I'm Josh stommer\nand welcome to stat quest today we're\ngonna be talking about the main ideas\nbehind principle component analysis and\nwe're going to cover those concepts in\nfive minutes if you want more details\nthan you get here be sure to check out\nmy other PCA video\nlet's say we had some normal cells\nif you're not a biologist imagine that\nthese could be people or cars or cities\nor etc they could be anything even\nthough they look the same we suspect\nthat there are differences these might\nbe one type of cell or one type of\nperson or car or city etc these might be\nanother type of cell and lastly these\nmight be a third type of cell\nunfortunately we can't observe\ndifferences from the outside so we\nsequence the messenger RNA in each cell\nto identify which genes are active this\ntells us what the cell is doing if they\nwere people we could measure their\nweight blood pressure reading level etc\nokay here's the data\neach column shows how much each gene is\ntranscribed in each cell for now let's\nimagine there are only two cells if we\njust have two cells then we can plot the\nmeasurements for each gene this gene\ngene one is highly transcribed in cell\none and lowly transcribed in cell two\nand this gene gene 9 is lowly\ntranscribed in cell 1 and highly\ntranscribed in cell 2\nin general cell one and cell to have an\ninverse correlation this means that they\nare probably two different types of\ncells since they are using different\ngenes\nnow let's imagine there are three cells\nwe've already seen how we can plot the\nfirst two cells to see how closely they\nare related now we can also compare cell\none to sell three cell one and cell\nthree are positively correlated\nsuggesting they are doing similar things\nlastly we can also compare cell two to\ncell three the negative correlation\nsuggests that cell two is doing\nsomething different from cell 3\nalternatively we could try to plot all\nthree cells at once on a three\ndimensional graph cell one could be the\nvertical axis cell two could be the\nhorizontal axis\nand sell three could be depth we could\nthen rotate this graph around to see how\nthe cells are related to each other but\nwhat do we do when we have four or more\ncells draw tons and tons of to sell\nplots and try to make sense of them all\nor draw some crazy graph that has an\naxis for each cell and makes our brain\nexplode\nno both of those options are just plain\nsilly\ninstead we draw a principal component\nanalysis or PCA plot\na PCA plot converts the correlations or\nlack thereof among the cells into a 2d\ngraph\ncells that are highly correlated cluster\ntogether this cluster of cells are\nhighly correlated with each other\nso are these and so are these to make\nthe clusters easier to see we can\ncolor-code them once we've identified\nthe clusters in the PCA plot we can go\nback to the original cells and see that\nthey represent three different types of\ncells doing three different types of\nthings with their genes BAM\nhere's one last main idea about how to\ninterpret PCA plots the axes are ranked\nin order of importance\ndifferences among the first principal\ncomponent access PC one are more\nimportant than differences along the\nsecond principal component access PC two\nif the plot looked like this\nwhere the distance between these two\nclusters\nis about the same as the distance\nbetween these two clusters\nthen these two clusters are more\ndifferent from each other than these two\nclusters before we go you should know\nthat PCA is just one way to make sense\nof this type of data there are lots of\nother methods that are variations on\nthis theme of dimension reduction these\nmethods include heat maps tea Snee plots\nand multiple dimension scaling plots the\ngood news is that I've got stat quests\nfor all of these so you can check those\nout if you want to learn more note if\nthe concept of dimension reduction is\nfreaking you out check out the original\nstat quest on PCA I take it nice and\nslow so it's clearly explained hooray\nwe've made it to the end of another\nexciting stat quest if you like the stat\nquest and want to see more of them\nplease subscribe and if you have any\nideas for additional stat quests well\nput them in the comments below until\nnext time quest on\n",
