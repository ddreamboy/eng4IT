  "text": "here's the problem statement with iot\nthe Internet of Things everything\nbecomes a computer\nbasically a light bulb is a computer\nthat lights up your home a thermostat is\na computer that controls the temperature\na car is a computer that takes you\nplaces a security camera is a computer\nthat records activities everything\nbecomes a computer great where's the\nproblem well we know from security that\nevery computer can in fact be hacked so\nif everything becomes a computer with\niot and every computer can be hacked\nwhat does that mean\nit means this\neverything can be hacked that's the\nworld we're moving to so let's take a\nlook at an example of what I mean by\nthis take the Linux operating system\nlast time I checked it's got about 27 28\nmillion lines of code that make up the\noperating system Windows\neven more about 50 million how about the\nfact that we have cars today with\nsoftware in them that have over a\nhundred million lines of code in them\nnow what does all of that mean think of\nthis as your attack surface and what\nhappens with those things well in fact\nas the number of lines of code goes up\nthen so does complexity\nand so do the number of bugs that are in\nthe software just because there's more\nsoftware and if at the same rate you're\ngoing to end up with more bugs\nultimately that means we have more\nvulnerabilities as all of these things\nincrease\ncomplexity is the enemy of security so\nthat means the more complex the system\ngets the more insecure it gets as well\nso what can we do about this attack\nsurface think of the attack surface a\nlittle bit differently if we've got a\nbullseye over here if you've got a huge\nBullseye then it's going to be easier\nfor the bad guy to hit it when he's\ntrying to attack you however if we can\nshrink that Bullseye down to a minuscule\ndot then it's going to be much harder\nfor the bad guy to do what he wants to\ndo and you can see it's going to be hard\nto shrink some of these attack surfaces\nbut we are going to look at some things\nthat you can do for instance what are\nthe risks why do you even care about\nthis well there's the issue of privacy\nif someone breaks into these devices\nmaybe they are recording you and seeing\nyou or tracking your activities there's\nthe issue of safety some of these may\neven be implantable medical devices\nimagine a defibrillator or an\nimplantable insulin pump one day those\nthings could then be hacked and all\nkinds of havoc could occur from that\nor a denial of service attack a denial\nof service could be where someone has\nattacked your device and now your device\nwon't respond to you that's one example\nhere another example is where your\ndevice because it's a computer remember\nis being used to attack other people's\ndevices and now you are unwittingly part\nof the denial of service on other people\nwell what can you do to shrink this\nattack surface and lessen these kinds of\nrisks happening to you we're going to\ntake a look at five things you can do in\nyour home and five things you can do in\nyour office and organization to reduce\nthe risk of iot security okay now what\ncan we do in order to avoid those risks\nwell I'm going to give you five things\nfirst of all for your home iot devices\nwe're going to take a look first at\ncredentials\ncreds basically you've got credentials\nthat are a user ID password\nthose are the typical ones and you've\ngot those for your iot devices as well\nas for your home network and the iot\ndevices exist on that Network so you'll\nwant to secure both of those\nthe iot device for instance in this case\nit's a camera but there's probably an\nadministrator interface that goes into\nthis so that this person can log in that\nperson probably being you if you're the\nlocal iot support guy in your home so\nthat you can log in and change\nconfigurations and things like that\nchange that stuff don't go with the\ndefault don't go with the default user\nID if you can change it definitely don't\ngo with you the default password\ndefinitely change that and the same\nthing is true when it comes to your home\nrouter and the network there so there\nwill be also an administrator interface\nhere change the default user ID and\npassword to the extent that you're able\nto and also the Wi-Fi network itself\nmost of these things of iot are working\nover a Wi-Fi network we want to change\nfrom the default SSID that the network\nbroadcasts we want to make sure we have\na strong password on the network work\nitself maybe even make it not\ndiscoverable although sometimes that\nruns into problems with the individual\ndevices but make sure that the network\nas well is secure now I said change\nthese passwords I'm going to say\nremember this rule about passwords\nlength\nis strength small passwords are almost\nalways worse than longer passwords so\ntry to make your password as long as the\nsystem will make it and since you can't\nremember it because you don't want to\nset them all to the same thing store\nthem in a password Vault so that way you\ncan put all of these passwords into the\nVault and then you unlock the Vault with\none password that you know and better\nyet use multi-factor authentication that\nis something you are and something you\nhave as well so maybe a biometric in\norder to open the safe and then this\npart will be much more secure\nokay what's next the network itself I\ntalked about some of the things you can\ndo to secure the network but how about\nthe configuration the overall\narchitecture of your home network so\nthis is what it normally looks like\nyou've got a bunch of users here and\nthey're inside your home they're you\nknow using their laptops and stuff like\nthat their devices in order to\nultimately probably access the internet\nget out to the rest of the world and so\nhere's our home router again but what\nI'm going to suggest to you is to carve\nout a special Network segment for iot\nthis a lot of these routers support\nwhat's known as a guest Network or a DMZ\narea however the terminology is on that\nparticular system what you want to do is\ncarve out this separate Network and put\nall of your iot devices in that Network\nthe idea being that if there's a\nvulnerability that happens down here it\nwon't have direct access to all of these\nthings and it will still be protected\nbecause it's behind the firewalling\ncapabilities the network address\ntranslation and things like that that\nyour router implements so create the iot\nspecial Network and maybe you let your\nguests in on that as well but that that\nwill give you a little better separation\nokay what else patching\nall of these devices have tons of\nsoftware in them and what we want to do\nis make sure that the software or the\nfirmware whichever the the terminology\nis on it that that stuff is absolutely\nup to date as up-to-date as it can\npossibly be and the best way to do that\nis to set it up to automatically update\nrather than do this manually if you're\ndoing it manually the chances are you're\nnot going to remember to do it\nfrequently enough and you're going to\nfall behind and why does that matter\nbecause the security vulnerabilities\nwill exist in your software for a longer\nperiod of time whenever new versions of\nsoftware and firmware come out almost\nalways there are security patches in\nthere and you want to get those as\nquickly as you can again reducing your\nattack surface\nwhat else well another idea in security\nis the principle of least privilege the\nprinciple of least privilege says I want\nto turn off everything that I possibly\ncan and Harden My systems that's one\naspect of principle of least privilege I\nwant to effectively disable any\nunnecessary functions again this is\nhardening I also want to make sure that\nonly the right resources have access and\nare turned on\nso to give an example of this let's say\nwe've got our refrigerator here and it's\nan iot refrigerator so it does all the\ngreat bells and whistles here is a user\nand the question is does that user\nreally need remote access into the\nfridge\nI don't know if you think they do then\ngo ahead and Grant that but understand\nthat you've also created some risk\nyou've created more attack surface if\nyou're not getting enough value out of\nthe features that you're getting from\ndoing that I would say turn that off\nanother example is is this fridge\nconnected say to the cloud so that you\ncan create your shopping lists and\naccess them elsewhere there might be\nsome features that you really want to\nuse just understand with every single\none of these connections you need to\nmake a conscious decision about risk and\nif that risk is in fact worth it in many\ncases what we may also be doing by\nconnecting these things is creating a\ngreater risk for us in terms of privacy\nas well so some of these are back doors\nthat an attacker could come into and\ntake control of the device and once they\ndo they could violate our privacy they\ncan make the device stop working they\ncould do all sorts of other things they\ncould use your refrigerator in order to\nattack other people believe it or not\neven without your knowledge and so\nfinally the maybe the best thing that\nyou can do if you don't need it turn it\noff I mean literally not just disable\nthe feature but if your security camera\nis in uh in your home then when you're\nin the home you probably don't need it\nto be on probably this is a better\nsetting literally turn the camera off\nmaybe even unplug it if you're extra\nsecurity conscious paranoid so that way\nit cannot be spying on you it can't be\nbeing used by a bad guy to do bad stuff\nso what I'm saying is be very conscious\nand intentional about the features that\nyou have and the way you've laid things\nout so that the stuff that is on is\nactually serving your needs and it's not\njust on because it was on by default and\nthat's the way the manufacturer shipped\nthe device okay now we've talked about\nwhat you need to do to secure the iot\ndevices in your home\nhow about in the office some people will\nbring home devices into the office also\nwe have people working from home in a\nhome office so it's effectively like all\nof those iot devices are part of the\ncorporate Network as well what can we do\nin those cases to secure the office well\nit begins with policy\nI need to have some sort of description\nthat says this is what's allowed this is\nnot what's allowed these are the kinds\nof things that we are going to implement\nand enforce from a security standpoint\nand by the way just saying don't ever\nbring these devices in that's a fine\nstatement to make it doesn't mean it's\nactually going to happen because a lot\nof times people will do what they're\ngoing to do anyway so the policy needs\nto be useful in this case not just\nsomething that you write on paper the\nnext thing would be to train our users\nhelp them understand what they're doing\nthat help security and the things that\nthey do that hurt security help them\nunderstand what are the risks in an iot\ndevice because to them it just looks\nlike something hey it looks harmless I\nplug it in and it works but they don't\nrealize that it may be exfiltrating data\nout of their Network that it might be\nimplanting a virus in their device that\nit could be used for spying it could be\nused for all kinds of things so make\nsure people understand they're going to\nbe more likely to follow a policy that\nthey understand than a policy that just\nsounds like a bunch of edicts that are\npassed down from on an eye\nnext thing enable\nenable the security\nI talked about all of these kinds of\ncontrols that we can put in place in\norder to make a system more secure an\niot system less risky for us that's what\nwe want to do we want to enable all\nthose things even in the office\nenvironment and again start from the\nhome and then expand out from there\nand then we want to discover\nagain you could say I'm not going to\nallow this but that doesn't mean it\ndoesn't exist I need an ability to\ndiscover all of these things and find\nout when someone has brought an iot\ndevice into our Network when something\nin a home network has connected in that\nwe didn't expect it to do the good news\nis there are tools and there are\nservices that will do this kind of\nautomatic Discovery for you that way you\ncan be alerted when you have now created\na case that your attack surface has just\nincreased and then finally we need to\nenforce\nenforce\nthe policy that we just came up with\nput into practice the training that\nwe've given you also put into practice\nthe security controls have those\nimplemented have them happen\nautomatically as much as possible\nautomatically discover new devices and\nthen ultimately have a way to enforce\nall of that and do it seamlessly this is\nwhat we're about what we're trying to do\nis decrease the attack surface from a\nbig attack surface to a much smaller one\nand iot is pulling us in the opposite\ndirection if we don't get control of it\nand if we don't get control our devices\naren't serving us they're serving\nsomeone else so you want to make sure\nyour devices serve you keep your stuff\nsafe and secure\nthanks for watching if you found this\nvideo interesting and would like to\nlearn more about cyber security please\nremember to hit like And subscribe to\nthis
