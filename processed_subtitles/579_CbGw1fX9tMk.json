  "text": "[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Applause]\nhi there I'm Jonathan Strickland a\nsenior writer here at howstuffworks.com\nand host of tech stuff and I wanted to\ntalk to you today about you ubiquitous\nComputing and the pervasive internet so\nwhat are these things well ubiquitous\nComputing is this idea of computers\nbeing around us and part of everything\nwe do pretty much from the time we get\nup in the morning to the time we go to\nbed and sometimes even when we sleep it\nkind of comes from this idea of well\nbefore we had this this Computing world\nwhere there were a lot of people using\njust a few machines so you would have to\nshare time on a machine in order to get\naccess to it you would actually have\ngroups of people using terminals that\nwould each get access one at a time to a\nsupercomputer we called this time\nsharing then we move to a model where\nit's one user one machine that's kind of\nthe model we're in now although we're\nshifting away from that where you would\nhave a computer and it would be a\ndedicated machine just for you you can\nuse it however much you like and you're\nnot sharing it with anyone else well\nthen we've got the one user lots of\nmachines that's where we're headed to\nnow a lot of people now own multiple\ncomputers they also May own a smartphone\nperhaps some other mobile devices that\nhave internet connectivity built into\nthem and Computing built into them\nthat's the idea behind ubiquitous\nComputing we build computers into other\nthings around us so that we can interact\nwith them in a new way now right now we\ncan see it in things like smartphones\nvideo gaming consoles computers that\nsort of thing but we're going to see\nmore and more of that build into things\nlike basic appliances perhaps even the\nclothing we wear will have some of these\nelements sewn into them using electronic\nFabrics now if that sounds a little too\nfar out to you just remember that the\nsmartphone alone can really add a lot of\nfunctionality to ubiquitous Computing\nimagine downloading an app to your phone\nthat when it interacts with your home\nnetwork allows you to control things\nlike your environmental controls in your\nhouse this isn't Science Fiction it's\nhappening right now it'll just be a\nlittle while longer before we get to a\npoint where when you move one from one\nroom to the next the climate controls\nchange automatically based upon your\npreferences might come into a little bit\nof conflict when there's a bunch of\npeople in the room and all of their\ntheir preferences are at odds with one\nanother but we'll work that out as we\nget to it now pervasive internet is a\nrelated idea this is an idea where\ninternet connectivity is universal\npretty much anywhere you go you'll be\nable to log into the internet we're\ngetting closer and closer to that too\nalthough we still have problems with\nthat you might find dead spots where you\nhave no Wi-Fi or cellular service and\ngetting connected to the internet might\nbe a little difficult you might have to\nhave a satellite hookup which is not\ncheap but we're getting closer to having\na pervasive internet experience and the\nidea here is that between ubiquitous\nComputing and pervasive internet we'll\nbe able to network everything your\nentire experience through life will be\ncompletely networked all around you\nwhich means that you'll be able to\ndictate the experience you have in life\nbased upon the technology surrounding\nyou at any given time so let's say that\nyou like the the room a certain\ntemperature you like certain music you\nlike certain kinds of food well your\nrefrigerator is going to tell you when\nyou're low on your favorite ingredients\nyour room is going to adjust to the\nright kind of temperature as soon as you\nwalk in your iPod or other MP3 player is\ngoing to start playing the music you\nlike as soon as you pick it up these are\nthe ideas that we're moving toward we're\nnot that far away from it we're already\nseeing hints of it in our daily lives\nbut trust me in 5 or 10 years it's going\nto be everywhere you're going to love it\nfor more on this and thousands of other\ntopics visit howstuffworks.com and don't\nforget to check out our other podcasts\nfree on\niTunes\n",
