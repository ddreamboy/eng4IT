  "text": "with great power comes great\nresponsibility\nthese are the words of stan lee author\nof the spider-man comic book series\nbut where does data power come from and\nwhat are the responsibilities for us\nas data scientists first let's talk\nabout\npower in may 2017 the economist ran the\nfollowing headline\nthe world's most valuable resource is no\nlonger oil but data\nin fact the data as the new oil analogy\noriginates from as early as 2006 when\nclive humbey from tesco in the uk\nsaid that data is the new oil it's\nvaluable but if unrefined\nit cannot really be used and that's\nwhere you come in\ndata is an extremely valuable resource\nbut it's up to you to extract the value\ndata is potential and it's up to you to\nrealize its full potential\nbeing a data scientist is a powerful and\nprivileged role\nyou have highly sought after skills\nskills that most people do not have the\nopportunity\nto be educated on this is due to a\nvariety of reasons\nincluding teaching statistics and\nprogramming is hard\nand we don't have enough teachers to do\nit getting exposed to and encouraged to\npursue skills in data science is rare\nand especially rare in certain groups\nlike women or rural populations\na master's degree in data science is\nexpensive and therefore cost prohibitive\nfor many\nand we do not have widespread\nstatistical literacy\nto make the path to becoming a data\nscientist easier\nlearning brand new things is tough power\nwill be handed to you\nin possibly unexpected ways western\nsociety\noften values quantitative methods over\nobservational reports lived experience\nor even rigorous qualitative analyses\nthis has some historical roots in\nmisogyny and colonialism\nwhere only a small proportion of people\nwere seen as intelligent enough to\npursue logical subjects like math and\nstatistics\nof course science is still crucial for\nsociety and quantitative methods can\ntell us a lot\nbut they are overvalued even when plenty\nof statistical findings are outright\nfalse\nremember boyd and crawford's mythology\nof big data\nso you may be handed respect authority\nand power\nsimply for being the data science person\nso here you are a powerful resource and\npeople looking to you to turn the\nnumbers into insight\nafter acknowledging the privileges you\ncame in with you can also be proud of\nyourself for making it this far\nyou worked hard to learn your data\nscience skills and you do have lots of\ndifferent talents\nfrom programming to visualizing to\ncommunicating you are a very important\npart of solving the world's problems\nso now let's talk about responsibility\nwhen you think of data science you might\nthink about business models such as\nthose that optimize\nad revenue even these seemingly trivial\ndata science tasks come with a lot\nof responsibility as a small mistake\ncould propagate into a lot of money lost\nfor your company\ndata science is used in every field\nimaginable from marketing to medicine\nfrom transportation to waste management\nand while a data scientist might feel a\nbit removed from the real world\nimplementations of their work\ntheir models and analytics will\neventually affect real lives\nthe decisions we make because it's\nconvenient or tidy or because we\naren't entirely sure what the model is\ndoing yes that will happen to you\ncan end up with large scale harms\nlet's work through an example of a not\nso obvious mistake in an algorithm that\nsnowballs into unjustly harming a lot of\npeople\nrisk assessment scores for whether or\nnot someone is likely to commit a crime\nthis isn't science fiction this is real\nlife risk assessment scores are used in\nthe criminal justice system today\nbecause people tend to see numbers and\nstatistics as more objective\nsociety has introduced predictive\nalgorithms into our courtrooms and law\nenforcement agencies\nit's not just one algorithm it's many\nranging from predicting where a crime\nwill occur\nor using someone's social media data to\npredict if they are likely to be more\nviolent\nand in this example we will be looking\nat an algorithmic risk assessment of\nrecidivism recidivism the tendency of a\nconvicted criminal to re-offend\nparole or release from prison with some\nrestrictions\ncan be granted to prisoners who are\ndeemed fit to reintegrate into society\nan individual may go up for parole where\nseveral factors will be examined by a\njudge\nincluding their original crime their\nbehavior while serving in prison\ntheir demographics and other features\nwith an overworked system and the desire\nto reduce imprisonment numbers\nit makes sense to want an automated\nsystem to help determine\nwho should get parole but hidden in this\ndesire for efficiency\nis the perpetuation of racial bias\nbiases that have a lot of historical\ninertia in these systems\nit is well known that our prison system\nis particularly harsh on black and brown\nmembers of society\nthe school to prison pipeline describes\nthe disproportionate tendency of minors\nand young adults\nfrom disadvantaged backgrounds to become\nincarcerated\nbecause of increasingly harsh school and\nmunicipal policies\nas well as because of educational\ninequality in the united states\nwith black students affected the most\nharshly\nblack men are at the highest risk for\npolice violence\nand overall receive longer prison\nsentences than white men\narrested for the same crimes these\nracial disparities are present in all\nhistorical crime data used to train\nalgorithms maybe you're seeing the\nproblem now\na good way to repeat biases of the past\nwould be to use them to train an\nautomated tool to determine the future\nwhen training data contains racial bias\nthe model will learn that racial bias\nand replicate it we are telling a model\nthis is who got parole in the past\nplease automatically sort people to fit\nwhat we have done before\nbut what we have done before is racist\nwhat seems objective and flawless to a\njudge or jury\nwho are unlikely to know what went into\nthe tool is actually an opaque\nreplicator of bias\nit is our job as data scientists to both\nthink critically about algorithmic\ndesign\nand to communicate how algorithms work\nto non-experts\nwhen in doubt ask the stakeholders of\nthe models to weigh\nin we call this situated data science\nwhere the goal is not to design for but\nto design with\nremember to stay kind stay curious and\nstay critical\n",
