  "text": "cloud computing is a term that refers to\nthe ability to access everything\nremotely on the internet instead of\nlocally on your devices\neverything you use like mail music and\nvideo streaming apps all have data that\nneeds to be stored somewhere that\nsomewhere is really just a Global\nNetwork of computer clusters and servers\nbut the network of computer clusters\ndoesn't quite have a ring to it so we'll\njust call it the cloud\nhere's a relatable example to help you\nunderstand\nall of you are watching YouTube on some\ntype of device with most of you on your\nphones and computers but even someone\ntablets and TVs how many videos have you\nwatched today and more importantly how\nmany of my videos have you watched\nif you've watched them all first of all\nthank you but secondly this means you've\nwatched about four gigabytes worth of\ncontent\nwithout cloud computing you would have\nto store these four gigabytes on your\nlocal device just to be able to watch\nthem combine that with everything else\nyou watch on YouTube and your device\nwould be full in no time thankfully\nYouTube has cloud-based storage which\nmeans that my four gigabytes of videos\nare stored somewhere far away in a large\nand expensive cluster of computers and\nput on display to the internet YouTube\nstores these videos so you don't have to\ncloud computing isn't a single piece of\ntechnology instead it's a system which\nis made up of three main types of\nservices\nsoftware platform and infrastructure\nsoftware as a service represents online\nsoftware applications that manage every\nservice for you\nDropbox is a great example of this all\nyou have to do is purchase the software\nand you can start uploading to the cloud\nDropbox handles everything\nplatform as a service providers manage\npretty much everything but allow you to\nhandle the applications and data\nthis makes it primarily used as a\nplatform for software development\nHeroku is the perfect example here\ndevelopers are able to host their\napplications on the cloud without need\nto worry about anything except the\ndevelopment of the application\nlastly infrastructure as a service is\nused when you want more flexibility than\nplatform as a service and want to handle\nthe middleware and operating system\ncomponents as well\nSome Cloud providers only offer one of\nthese three services but larger Cloud\nComputing Services like Google Cloud\nAmazon web services and Microsoft Azure\noffer options for all three types of\nservices this has been cloud computing\nin two minutes if you want more than two\nminutes please like subscribe and leave\na comment for what you'd like to see\nnext see you in the next video\n",
