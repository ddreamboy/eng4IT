  "text": "what if I told you that you can\nautomatically label your images for YOLO\nobject detection let me show you how you\ncan do it with auto\ndistill if you're new to my channel I\nteach Robotics and AI so subscribe to\nlearn more so the idea behind Auto\ndistill is we have these big models\nwhich are very heavy and not good for\nreal-time use such as grounding dyo and\nSam and we want to convert it to smaller\nfaster model so we can deploy it such as\nYOLO V8 and other YOLO variations now to\nget started go ahead and install auto\ndistill by running the commands here pip\ninstall the auto distill the grounded\nSam and the YOLO V8s roof flow and\nsupervision now to run auto distill we\nneed to download and prepare our images\nso there's two ways to go about this the\nfirst way is you could go ahead and\ndownload the data set with the images\ndirectly from roof flow and the second\noption is you could get raw video and\nthen split the video into the images for\ntraining so you can see here that you\ncould come to roboo here if you go to\nthe model you could select the model\nthat you want and then you could run\nthese commands here that will let you\ndownload those images and if you're\nworking with a raw video you could go\nahead and run these commands here now\nthat you have your video downloaded go\nahead and run these commands to split\nyour video into images and by running a\nfew more lines of code we get to see the\noutput of the images that we extracted\nas you can see over here so this is an\nimportant part where we prepare our\nprompt so we will have our text captions\nthat will map to our class names so for\nexample we can see here we have milk\nbottle to bottle and blue cap to cap now\nwe're ready to start the auto labeling\nprocess so you can see here we have some\nsetup we're going to use our grounded\nSam here and then once we do that we get\nto display our images to see how it\nperforms so you run these code here and\nit'll show the output of our annotations\nso you can see that it extracted the\nbottle as well as the cap pretty nicely\nnow we're finally ready to train our\nYOLO go ahead and run these commands and\nit'll start the training process now\nafter the training we could view our\nresults to see how well the training did\nyou can see here is our confusion Matrix\nand then if you scroll down you can look\nat the map to see how well it did in the\npredictions and here you can see this is\nsome of the results for the prediction\nthat I did on the validation batch now\nif you're ready to test this out on\nunseen images go ahead and run the\ninference using the best model okay so\nif you found this video helpful give a\nlike And subscribe and I'll see you in\nthe next one\n",
