  "text": "Predictive Analytics if you think it\nsounds complicated that's mainly because\nit is in most cases building predictive\nmodels involve some fairly complex\ncalculations and require special tools\nso you might also think that those tools\ntend to be the realm of the data\nscientist putting Predictive Analytics\nout of the reach of the average business\ndue to a lack of said data scientist or\nbecause it was beyond their budget well\nthat might have been the case a few\nyears AO go but not so much anymore with\nthe Advent of artificial intelligence\nand machine learning becoming available\nto all there are now some much more\naccessible Solutions one of those being\npcan in this video we'll take a look at\nwhat pcan offers in terms of Predictive\nAnalytics using generative artificial\nintelligence or gen AI let's jump\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\nin hello and welcome to learn bi online\nwith me Adam finer helping you do more\nwith data Predictive Analytics isn't\nsomething I've really covered on this\nchannel so when pan approached me asking\nif I'd like to check out their tool I\ntook it for a spin and decided it was\nsomething that you guys might be\ninterested in too full disclosure pcan\nare very kindly sponsoring today's video\nI'm going to be demoing their platform\nfor you but they haven't told me what to\nsay so it's completely my review if you\nwant to check them out for yourself\nthere's a link in the description below\nif at this point you're asking yourself\nwhat is Predictive Analytics it's\nessentially using data statistical\nalgorithms and machine learning to\npredict future Behavior Trends and\noutcomes so this being a business\nintelligence Channel what are the kinds\nof predictions that businesses want to\nmake well there are a few very common\nuse cases things like Revenue prediction\nor churn which is predicting how many\nexisting customers might stop using a\nproduct or service in the future churn\nrate is the use case we're going to look\nat now using pan so let's jump onto my\ncomputer here on Pan's website it says\nreimagine machine learning with Pan's\npredictive gen AI or generative\nartificial intelligence level up your\nskills and impact with machine learning\nstart your AI Journey today it also says\nzero data engineering no data scientists\nneeded and coding optional which sounds\ngreat you can sign up here for a 14-day\nfree trial and when you do and you log\nin you'll be greeted by Pan's AI\nassistant who says I'll assist you in\nformulating a predictive question I'll\nthen create a SQL notebook to build a\ntraining set so what would you like to\npredict well in our case I want to\npredict customer churn so I'll send\nthat and the reply comes back great I'd\nbe happy to help you solve your customer\nchurn predictive use case for example a\npredictive question could be predict\nweekly which customers will stop making\npurchases in the next 7 days this is\njust an example and we can refine it to\nbetter suit your needs in order for me\nto help you phrase your own predictive\nquestion all you need to do is to answer\nfour simple questions ready to get\nstarted let's start with the first\nquestion who or what is the subject of\nyour prediction in this case is it safe\nto assume that the subject is your\ncustomers well that is correct so I'll\nsend yes\ngreat so we're predicting something\nabout your customers now let's move on\nto the second question what is the\nspecific activity or event that you are\ntrying to predict about your customers\nin the context of customer churn this\ncould be something like customers will\nstop making purchases or customers will\ncancel their subscription could you\nplease specify the activity you're\ninterested in predicting well it's stop\nmaking purchases that's what we're\ninterested in so we'll send that perfect\nso we're predicting whether your\ncustomers will stop making purchases now\non to the third question how far into\nthe future do you want to predict this\nactivity for example do you want to\npredict if a customer will stop making\npurchases in the next 7 Days 14 days or\nperhaps a month please specify the time\nframe well for us we want a\nmonth great so we're predicting whether\na customer will stop making purchases in\nthe next month now for the final\nquestion do you want to predict this on\na recurring basis like daily weekly\nmonthly or is there a specific event\nafter which you want to predict for\nexample do you want to predict this\nevery week for all customers or only for\ncustomers after they make a purchase or\nafter they sign up well I actually want\nto predict this on a monthly basis so\nI'll send\nmonthly excellent so you want to make\nthis prediction on a monthly basis here\nis your predictive question predict\nmonthly which customers will stop making\npurchases in the next month exciting you\nmade it you can use this question as is\nor we can refine it further would you\nlike to add more details to this\nquestion no for me that looks good so\nI'm going to hit looks good fantastic in\norder to create a predictive SQL\nnotebook that fits your data\nrequirements we need to review your data\nsounds good please note that pan\nstrictly adheres to data security\ncompliance standards being ISO 271 and\nsock 2 so certified sure let's continue\nwith my\ndata let's talk\ndata to predict customer churn we need\nto have historical data about your\ncustomer's purchase Behavior do you have\na table that contains records of your\ncustomer purchases this table should\ninclude a unique identifier for each\ncustomer like a customer ID and the date\nof each purchase if you have such a\ntable could you please upload it as a\nCSV file using the attachment button\nnext to the chat input line so that's\nthis one here I'll hit that I've got\nthis transactions file here so we'll\nupload\nthat and we'll send\nit so pcan analyzes the file and uh\nfinds all the different columns that are\nin the source file and also attributes a\ndata type to each so um we need say this\nlooks\ngood great now let's identify the\nnecessary columns in your table we need\nto find one the column that holds the\ndate of each purchase this is mandatory\nas Pon cannot build a model without this\ncolumn and number two the column that\nholds the unique identifier for each\ncustomer this is also mandatory could\nyou please tell me the names of these\ncolumns in your table so we have the\ndate column here and right at the top we\nhave the customer ID column so I'm just\ngoing to say date and customer uncore\nID perfect so we have the date of each\npurchase in the dates column the unique\nidentifier for each customer in the\ncustomer ID column just to confirm are\nthese the correct columns that we should\nuse for the prediction yes wonderful\nhere's a summary of the information\nyou've provided Okay so we've got the\npredictive question that we formulated a\nminute ago\nuh and information about the data schema\nthe table and the columns that we need\nso if that all looks good we're going to\nhit generate\nnotebook and it'll start the process of\ngenerating the predictive notebook now\nthis might take a minute or two so let's\njump forward to once it's done and here\nwe are in the generated notebook or\nnotbook as we're working with pcan of\ncourse so using this pcan notebook\nyou'll be able to train an ml or machine\nlearning model that answers your\npredictive question the one that we\nformulated a minute ago so the celles\nbelow contain queries SQL queries that\nwere automatically generated based on\nyour predictive question running them\nwill create a training Set uh using pans\nformat comprised of two parts so the two\nparts there's a core set which is a\ntable with historical examples of\ncustomers who did or did not stop making\npurchases and attribute tables so\nadditional tables with relevant\ninformation about the customers so\nif we go down here we see Finding\nrelevant customers for our core set\nwe're trying to learn how to make a\nmonthly prediction on customers as a\nbasis to learn from our training set\nfirst needs to have a table with a row\nfor each pair of customer and each month\nso this first query here it says this\nwill return all days weeks or months in\nthe given time frame and you can run\nthese different queries independently\nlet me just run this one\nhere and the result or at least a\npreview of the result will appear below\nhere and this uh the name being given to\nthis cell is monthly sampling helper\ntable okay if we keep going down next\nwe'll write a query that will find\nrelevant customer per sampled data so\nthat's this query here now obviously you\ndon't need to know SQL you can just run\nthese queries but obviously it does help\num to understand SQL a little bit to\nknow what's going on with these queries\nlet's just run\nthis there we go\nsuccess uh the label our positive and\nnegative examples in order to train a\nmodel we need to give it both positive\nand negative examples in our context the\npositive examples are customers who stop\nmaking purchases in the next month after\neach sampled month um so this query\nbelow will'll Now find positive and\nnegative examples from historical data\nlet's run\nthis and there we go did the customer\nstop making purchases within next month\nand for each customer ID we've got yes\nand\nno if we keep going down additional\nuseful data to help train the model as\nmentioned it's important to include\nadditional tables with information about\nour prediction subjects at pan we call\nthese attribute tables we used your data\nto create a sample attribute table so\nthat's this one here here attribute one\nusing the file that we uploaded for\nadditional data features and we can see\nhere it's taken some of the other fields\nfrom that file let's run this\n[Music]\nquery and there we go it's successfully\nrun that query too if you want you can\njust click this button here to run them\nall but if you want to sort of\nunderstand step by step what's going on\nand the results that are being returned\nthen you can just do one by one one so\nand that's it um we're now ready for\npcan to train the model let's review\nwhat we did so we created a table the\ncore set that samples the history of\ncustomers determining whether they stop\nmaking purchases or not per each sample\ndate which serves as uh positive and\nnegative examples the model can learn\nfrom and then secondly we added\nadditional tables the attribute tables\nthat provide more information for each\nof the customers up to each sample date\nthis extra data enhances the model\nability to infer patterns and make\naccurate predictions makes sense\nexciting the final step would be to\nclick train model at the top that's this\nuh purple button here let's hit that and\nwe have two options in terms of training\nmode we have fastest and production\nquality obviously production quality\ntakes several hours so for our purposes\nwe're going to stick to\nfastest uh data mapping and we're just\ngoing to validate and train\nobviously this is going to take a while\nso let's jump forward once that's run we\nend up in the model tab where first off\nwe can see the model's evaluation in\nterms of its performance we can see it\nhas a Precision of\n66.4% which is 2.6 times better than\nrule-based logic and 3.9 times better\nthan a random guess we can see other\nthings like the performance details\nthreshold configuration and also the top\ntop contributing columns to the model\npredictions we can see here that payment\nrecency is contributing\n69.9% of the model's prediction so we\ncan see here this column significantly\ndominates your model's prediction\nsuggesting possible overdependence and\npotential issues we'll sort that out in\na minute so in the model output tab we\ncan see a sample of the rows so in terms\nof the customer and the probability the\nthe classification and the veracity of\nthe\nresult so let's go back to\nqueries we can see here that notebooks\nare locked once a model is sent to\ntraining so if we did want to edit this\nmodel in any way perhaps by adding more\ndata we would need to duplicate it which\nI can do here or I'll just go back to\nthis screen here where we can see the\nnotebook we've previously created I'm\ngoing to click here and select\nduplicate and open up this new\ncopy so in terms of importing or adding\nnew data we have this part section here\nwhere we can choose to add new data\nthere's this customers file in fact I've\nalready included that here so I can\ngenerate this as an attribute this will\ncreate a new cell so we can see here\nthat this new customers information\ncould help better train the model so\nwhen we run all this new data will be in\nincluded so that's adding CSV data but\nwhat about other data sources well if I\ncome down to here I can choose to add\ndata and create a new connection and we\ncan see a menu of all of the different\ndata sources that we have at our\ndisposable so we have relational\ndatabases like SQL server and MySQL we\nhave data warehouses like Google\nbigquery and Amazon redshift and other\ndata sources like Salesforce and hub\nspot also we can see coming soon Google\nads and green plum if you don't see your\ndata source on this list you can click\nhere and suggest a new on for\ndevelopment so we've seen how to predict\ncustomer churn but what other Solutions\nare available from pcan Straight Out of\nthe Box well in terms of user\nacquisition we've got things like\nmarketing mix modeling predictive\ncampaign Ras or return on ad spend\ncampaign optimization using scan and\nLead scoring with predictive analytics\nfor customer engagement as well as\ncustomer churn we've got customer\nwinback and upsell and cross sell and in\nterms of supply chain we've got demand\nforecasting now if you're worried about\nnot having any data to practice this\nwith not to worry pcan has you covered\nif we go to their main page here we\nactually have two tutorial notebooks\nthat you can play around with so don't\nhesitate to do that so a massive thank\nyou to pcan for sponsoring today's video\nit really does help out the channel and\nkeeps the content coming if you want to\ncheck them out which I highly recommend\nyou do I'll leave a link in the\ndescription or just head on over to pan.\na thanks so much for watching and I'll\nsee you soon for another video Until\nthen bye\n",
