through an\noverview of AI ethics and machine\nlearning\nshould AI systems have personhood is AI\nbiased as AI permeates every facet of\nOur Lives from health care and education\nto finance and entertainment the\nsignificance of AI ethics becomes ever\nmore Paramount the potential\nconsequences of neglecting these ethical\nconsiderations can range from Mere\ninconveniences to severe societal\nramifications\nour journey together will uncover the\nfoundations of artificial intelligence\nits applications and the ethical\nquestions that shape this transformative\nfield\nalong the way we're incredibly lucky to\nbe also joined by a few guest speakers\nincluding okezway Bell from an\norganization mobilizing over 1400 people\nfor Tech issues the development policy\nand education and

course\nlet's begin\nin this video course we'll Define ai and\nits various types in delve into\ntechniques subfields ethics and real\nworld applications we'll examine not\njust the tech itself but also its\nimplications on society economy and\nGlobal development\nthis is not a technical course there's\nplenty of amazing incredible AI\nprogramming content on free code Camp if\nthat's what you're looking for\ninstead we're going to focus on how AI\nis currently being used how it might be\nused and how we can ensure that it's\nemployed in a way that benefits Humanity\nas this course presupposes no prior\nknowledge of AI or ml we're going to\ndefine a bunch of terms and Concepts\nlike Ai and ml\nif you're already really comfortable\nwith topics like neural networks or\nnatural language processing\nyou can feel free to skip part two the\nbasics of the AI and ml\nso what are you going to get out of this\nvideo\nour journey is more than just talking\nabout technology it's a holistic broader\nview by the end of our time together\nyou'll have a groundnut in the basics of\nAI from the algorithms that power it to\nthe applications that make it so\nrevolutionary\nwe won't stop at just understanding the\nmechanics it's about ethics values in\nthe real world implications that make AI\nnot only a scientific Marvel but a\nphilosophical moral and societal\nchallenge\nhi everyone my name is okazley Bell and\nI'm a student at Stanford and the\nfounder of fitter Tom one of the world's\nlargest Civil Society groups working on\nthe many limbs of building and\nregulating responsible technology\nespecially AI I'll be speaking on a\ncouple of topics in this course with\narguably the most important question to\nstart off with what is AI\na common misconception is that the term\nAI is typically confined to high\nfunctioning systems like chat GPT for\nexample but in reality it can be as\nsimple as a pre-programmed chat bot as\ncomplex as Google or tick tock's content\nrecommendation algorithms or as\nconsequential as disease or Grime risk\nprediction systems while the connotation\nof AI varies across Academia and\nIndustry it typically refers to systems\nthat use math to provide Automotive\ngenerative or predictive outputs or\nfunctions so AI at its highest level is\nabout crafting algorithms that allow\nmachines to perform tasks typically\nrequiring human intelligence this\nincludes learning from data reasoning\nlogically solving problems perceiving\nthe environment and even understanding\nhuman languages ai's applications are\nnot confined to a single domain they\nstretch across various Fields both in\ngeneral spheres and within the nuanced\nArena of International Development\nai's ability to analyze massive data\nsets enables more informed decisions in\ngovernment policy but also in very\ndifferent spaces such as finance and\nclimate attack\nit's transforming Health Care as well\nranging from enhancing diagnosis to\npersonalizing treatment especially\nproviding vital support in\nunder-resourced areas\nartificial intelligence is reshaping the\neducational landscape through\npersonalized learning adaptive content\nand making e-learning accessible even in\nremote regions and its influence on\nrecruiting and employment follows a\nsimilar Trend redefining practices\nthrough tailored Solutions and\ntechnological innovation\neven agriculture is witnessing an AI\ndriven Revolution were optimizing\nfarming techniques for higher yields and\nsupporting small-scale Farmers with AI\ndriven insights are just the beginning\nof what's possible\nin the second half of this course we'll\ndelve deeper into some of these areas\nwhile this course offers a comprehensive\noverview I have consciously chosen to\nkeep it open to all ages apolitical and\nnon-us Centric\nso some applications of AI such as those\nin elections and voting or the creation\nof adult content won't be discussed in\ndetail if you find these topics\nintriguing links to resources for\nfurther exploration will be provided in\nthe description of this video\nso\nthe big question\nwhy should you care\nwhy watch the rest of this video course\nto start\nunethical AI practices have the\npotential to result in widespread\ndiscrimination\nAI systems are only as unbiased as the\ndata that they are trained on if these\nsystems are trained on unrepresented\ndata they can unintentionally perpetuate\nand amplify existing societal biases\nthis can lead to discriminatory outcomes\nin vital areas such as employment\nlending and many more potentially\ndisadvantageous to certain groups based\non factors like race gender or\nsocioeconomic status\ntrying to solve a problem or end a\npattern of human-driven discrimination\nusing artificial intelligence often\nbackfires because algorithms are\ndesigned to imitate human behavior not\ndeviate from it\nalignment in the context of AI refers to\nthe Endeavor to ensure that AI system\nobjectives actions and outcomes are in\nharmony with human values and goals\nmisaligned AI systems pose a significant\nrisk because their objectives may not\ncoincide with ours leading to unintended\nand potentially harmful outcomes\nconsider for instance a hypothetical\nsuper intelligent AI whose primary\nobjective is to optimize paperclip\nproduction\nif not properly aligned such an\nartificial intelligence could consume\nall available resources including vital\nones necessary for human survival to\nachieve its goal of Maximum paper clip\nproduction effectively leading to a\ncatastrophic scenario for Humanity\nthis extreme example\noften referred to as the paperclip\nmaximizer thought experiment underlines\nthe potential severity of AI\nmisalignment\nwhat that means is that it is incumbent\nupon us to ensure the development of AI\nsystems aligns with human values and\ninterests and rigorous ethical scrutiny\nis applied to prevent any worst case\nscenario from becoming a reality\nif developed and deployed ethically AI\nsystems can serve as powerful tools for\nsocietal good\nthey can promote fairness by making\nunbiased decisions\nthey can enhance commercial\naccountability by ensuring transparency\nand Foster inclusivity by providing\npersonalized solutions to diverse\npopulations\nfrom assisting doctors in diagnosing\ndiseases to helping Educators provide\npersonalized learning experiences\nethical AI has the potential\nto improve countless lives and create a\nmore Equitable Society\nand yet the importance of AI ethics\nextends Beyond immediate outcomes AI is\npoised to be a defining technology of\nour future with the potential to reshape\nour social fabric economy and Global\nOrder\nas developers users policy makers and\nmost importantly as humans we are all\nstakeholders in this future and so it's\nour shared responsibility to ensure that\nAI Technologies are developed and used\nin ways that align with our ethical\nvalues and mitigate harm\nunderstanding AI ethics is not just\nabout preventing negative outcomes but\nrather actively working towards a future\nwhere AI serves as a tool for human\nflourishing\nso the study of AI ethics encouraged us\nto not just ask what can we do with AI\nbut what should we do\nit pushes us to consider how we can\nharness ai's immense potential\nresponsibly\nin a way that respects our shared human\nvalues promotes those Equitable outcomes\nand contributes to a better future for\nall of us\nAI ethics therefore is not just\nimportant\nit's essential\nare you excited yet we're just getting\nstarted next we're going to explore the\nbasics of AI and ml\nnow we are going beyond the surface to\nexplore AI types and techniques\nincluding machine learning or ml in\nparticular\nwe'll demystify how algorithms can learn\nfrom data explore the architecture\nbehind neural networks and look at how\ndifferent algorithms serve different\npurposes\nin the world of artificial intelligence\nwe commonly speak of three main types of\nAI\nthe first is narrow or weak AI such as\nSiri or Alexa designed to perform\nspecific tasks though quite skilled in\ntheir specific areas these systems can't\ngo beyond their defined scope\nmoving up the ladder we find General AI\nor strong AI\na theoretical concept of machines with\nthe ability to perform any intellectual\ntask that a human can\nit's an ambitious goal that we are still\nstriving to achieve although recent\nmodels such as Google scata are getting\ncloser\nfinally there's the concept of super\nintelligent AI which would surpass human\nintelligence entirely\nhaving the ability to learn and\nunderstand any task\nit's a thrilling and futuristic idea but\nit also brings up deep ethical and\nphilosophical questions\nmost AI researchers believe we're still\na ways away from anything resembling\nsuper intelligent AI\nbut as we'll discuss more later once you\nhit that point things begin moving\npretty quickly\ntogether we'll explore each of these\ntypes of AI in Greater detail throughout\nthe rest of this video\nin the realm of artificial intelligence\nseveral techniques enable machines to\nemulate human-like intelligence\nfirst we have machine learning or ml\nwhich is a core technique allowing\nsystems to learn from experience and\nimprove over time\nunlike traditional programming where\ninstructions are explicitly given ml\nenables systems to adapt and evolve by\nthemselves\nas you can see in the diagram the core\ndifferences in the inputs and the\noutputs with the normal program you\nwrite the program and give it input and\nit runs to create the output\nwith ML you give a model input and what\nyou want the output to look like and\nthen it figures out what the program\nshould look like to obtain that\nhere's some examples\nemail filtering\nmachine learning algorithms analyze\nthousands of emails learning the common\ncharacteristics of spam such as certain\nphrases patterns or sender profiles the\nmodel iteratively refines its\nunderstanding becoming a virtual expert\nin spam detection\nso you know that's why Gmail is so good\nmovie recommendations services like\nNetflix use ml to analyze your viewing\nhistory ratings and behavior to predict\nwhat you might like to watch next\nthe model considers various factors like\ngenres directors actors and even the\ntime you usually watch to offer\npersonalized recommendations the more\nyou interact the more tailored those\nrecommendations become\nthese examples showcase the adaptability\nof machine learning\nlearning from patterns and providing\nactionable insights or automation\nas technology evolves we can expect to\nsee even more applications that Leverage\nThe predictive power of machine learning\nnext there's deep learning an advanced\napproach inspired by the human brain's\ncomplex neural networks\nunlike traditional machine learning\nwhich can work with simpler algorithms\ndeep learning involves multiple layers\nof interconnected nodes that process\ninformation in a hierarchical manner\nthis allows deep learning models to\nautomatically extract features and\nhandle more complex tasks\ndeep learning has paved the way for\nadvancements in areas like facial\nrecognition and natural language\nprocessing\nthere's some examples of deep learning\nfacial recognition\ndeep learning algorithms particularly\nconvolutional neural networks or cnns\nwhich we'll talk more about later have\nrevolutionized facial recognition\ntechnology by analyzing thousands of\nfacial features and patterns these\nmodels can identify and verify\nindividuals with high accuracy\nanother popular one to talk about\nautonomous driving deep learning plays a\ncrucial role in enabling self-driving\ncars to navigate and make decisions by\nprocessing vast amounts of data from\ncameras sensors and radar deep neural\nnetworks can recognize objects\npedestrians and other vehicles can\nunderstand traffic signs and make\nreal-time driving decisions\nfinally\nwe have natural language process anger\nNLP\nwhich serves as a bridge between human\ncommunication and machine understanding\nwhile traditional machine learning may\nrequire manual feature extraction for\ntext Data NLP uses both statistical and\ndeep learning techniques to\nautomatically interpret respond to and\neven generate human languages\nthis enables a more nuanced\nunderstanding of language including\nsyntax semantics and context\nas we continue we'll delve into specific\nexamples in each of these techniques to\nprovide a concrete understanding of how\nthey function and their significant\nroles in our technology driven world\ntwo examples of natural language\nprocessing would be chat Bots or virtual\nassistants\nnatural language processing enables chat\nBots and assistance like Siri or Alexa\nto understand and respond to human\nlanguage by analyzing syntax semantics\nand contacts these systems can engage in\nconversation answer questions and\nperform tasks based on Voice or text\ncommands\nsentiment analysis is another one\nbusinesses often use natural language\nprocessing to analyze customer feedback\nreviews and social media comments to\ngauge public sentiment about products or\nservices\nby understanding the nuances of language\nincluding tone and emotion and sarcasm\nnatural language processing algorithms\ncan provide insights into customer\nsatisfaction and preferences\nwithin the diverse and expansive realm\nof AI there are also many even more\nspecialized sub-areas each contributing\nuniquely to that field\ngenerative AI is one such area that has\nrecently captured the imagination of\nmillions of people\nfrom the conversational prowess of\nChachi PT to the mathematical assistance\nof photomath NLP is enabling machines to\nunderstand\ninterpret and generate human languages\nthe subfield enhances the way that we\ninteract with technology\nmaking it more intuitive responsive and\nhuman-like\ncomputer vision is another fascinating\nsubfield dedicated to teaching computers\nto perceive and interpret the visual\nworld\nit's the driving force behind Crown\nbaking Innovations like self-dropping\ncars and facial recognition systems\nanother field near and dear to my heart\nis robotics a field that merges AI with\nmechanical design\nrevolutionizing industries from\nHealthcare to Manufacturing\nneural networks inspired by our brains\narchitecture are at the center of many\nAI applications\non a simplistic high level a neural\nnetwork is like a virtual brain that\nhelps computers learn from data\nimagine you're teaching it to recognize\na cat you show it many pictures some of\ncats and some of other things\nthe network makes guesses and you\ncorrect it the brain has layers of\nneurons that work together the first\nlayer looks at basic things like lines\nand colors the next layers combine these\nBasics to recognize shapes like ears and\nTails and the final layer puts it all\ntogether to say this is a cut\nover time with more pictures and\nCorrections the network gets better at\nrecognizing cats it's like learning to\nride a bike you get better with practice\nnow for a more technical breakdown\nneural networks consist of\ninterconnected layers of nodes or\nneurons each neuron receives an input\nprocesses it using a mathematical\nfunction and passes the output to the\nnext layer\nhere's what that looks like\nfirst the Network's input layer receives\nthe raw data such as pixel values of an\nimage\neach neuron corresponds to one feature\nlike a pixels color intensity then there\nare hidden layers which contain neurons\nthat perform computations\neach neuron's input is a weighted sum of\nthe previous layer's outputs plus a bias\nterm the weights and biases are the\nparameters that the network learns\nthrough training the weighted sum is\nthen passed through an activation\nfunction like sigmoid\nthis introduces non-linearity allowing\nthe network to learn complex patterns\nfinally the output layer produces the\nfinal prediction\nfor classification tasks a softmax\nfunction might be used to convert the\nfinal layer's outputs into probabilities\nnetworks are trained using a data set by\nrepeatedly making predictions and\ncomparing them to the true labels the\ndifferences between the predictions and\nthe True Values are measured using a\nloss function\nthe weights and biases are then updated\nusing an optimization algorithm like\ngradient descent\nthis process iteratively adjusts the\nparameters to minimize the loss in\nproving the Network's predictions\nthe key to understanding the training of\nneural networks is an algorithm called\nback propagation it calculates the\ngradients of the loss function with\nrespect to each weight and bias by\napplying the chain rule remember that\nfrom calculus\nthese gradients are used to update the\nparameters in the direction that reduces\nthe loss\nin other words a neural network learns\nto make predictions by adjusting its\ninternal parameters based on the\nfeedback it receives it's a highly\niterative and computational process that\nenables a network to learn complex\nmappings from inputs to outputs\nokay cool but what can you actually do\nwith them\nburst handwriting\nsystems like those used by postal\nservices to read addresses utilize\nneural networks to translate complex\nhandwriting into standardized text they\nanalyze individual Strokes curves and\nspacing learning to recognize various\nhandwriting styles\nanother one voice command recognition\nsmart devices like Siri use neural\nnetworks to understand that spoken\nlanguage\nthese networks analyze the sound waves\nbreaking them down into components that\nrepresent different aspects of speech\nlike tone pitch and accent\nand yet another one fraud detection\nnetworks analyze spending patterns\ngeographical locations in time to detect\nsuspicious activity if an unexpected\npattern emerges it might flag a\ntransaction for review\nnow let's look at a few different kinds\nof Networks\nrecurrent neural networks or rnns are\ndesigned for sequential data making them\nsuitable for applications like weather\nforecasting and real-time language\ntranslation\nunlike traditional neural networks rnns\nhave connections that loop back on\nthemselves allowing information to\npersist this looping mechanism enables\nthem to remember previous inputs in the\nsequence thereby understanding the\ncontext and making informed predictions\nabout future data\nfor example in language translation rnns\ncan learn the syntax grammar and context\nof a sentence providing more accurate\ntranslations\nconvolutional neural networks or cnns\nare tailored for visual tasks and are\nwidely used in medical Diagnostics and\nautonomous vehicles\ncnns utilize convolutional layers that\napply filters to the input data\ndetecting local patterns such as edges\nand textures\nthese detected features are then pooled\nand passed through fully connected\nlayers to make final predictions\nand medical Diagnostics cnns can detect\ntumors and x-rays or MRI scans by\nrecognizing subtle patterns that might\nbe missed by human eyes\nand autonomous vehicles they interpret\nthe visual World allowing the car to\nnavigate its environment\ngenerative adversarial networks organs\nconsist of two competing networks a\ngenerator and a discriminator\nthe generator creates content such as\nimages while the discriminator evaluates\nthe generated content against Real data\nthey are trained together in a cat and\nmouse game where the generator tries to\nproduce realistic content and the\ndiscriminator tries to distinguish\nbetween the real content and the\ngenerated content in the world of art\nGans have created entirely New pieces by\nlearning from historical art styles\nin gaming they generate realistic\nLandscapes and characters\nTransformers such as the generative\npre-trained Transformer or GPT models\nare significant advancement in neural\nnetworks particularly for NLP\nunlike rnns Transformers use attention\nmechanisms that weigh the importance of\ndifferent parts of the input allowing\nthem to capture long-range dependencies\nin data\nthis enables them to understand the\ncontext of words in a sentence even if\nthey are far apart\nGPT models have been employed in various\napplications from writing assistance to\ncomplex question answering systems\nshowcasing the power of neural networks\nand understanding and emulating human\nlanguage\nthere are dozens of other networks\nincluding many other extremely popular\nones but the networks we've discussed\nadequately showcase the breadth of ai's\ncapabilities from creative Endeavors to\nlife-saving Medical applications data\nsets are the lifeblood of machine\nlearning providing the raw material for\nthat learning\nlet's explore two different types\nlet's start with images for facial\nrecognition a data set might include\nthousands of faces each tag with an\nidentity the system learns to identify\nunique visual features and expressions\nanother example would be sentiment\nanalysis where text models like product\nreviews or social media posts are\nanalyzed to gauge public sentiment these\ndata sets can help in understanding the\nnuances of human language and emotion\nthe quality and integrity of a data set\nare really important biased or\nunbalanced data can lead to flawed\nmodels raising critical ethical\nconsiderations which we'll discuss way\nmore later\nas one example tick this image of a data\nset of puppies and chicken tenders the\nmeme illustrates how challenging it can\nbe for an AI model such as a\nconvolutional neural network to\ndifferentiate between objects that have\nsimilar visual characteristics\nwhile humans can usually tell the\ndifference based on context and\nexperience AI models might struggle\nit also underscores the importance of\ndiverse and representative training data\nif a model has not been exposed to\nenough variations of puppies and chicken\ntenders it may not have learned the\nsubtle features that distinguish them\nit also points to the complexity of\nfuture extraction in image recognition\nidentifying the essential\ncharacteristics that differentiate a\npuppy from a chicken tender is a\nnon-trivial task\nsometimes the process of learning\nfeatures can be problematic especially\nwith deep learning algorithms since\nthese systems determine and distinguish\nfeatures independently without any\nexplicit programming they sometimes\ndiscover incorrect yet true patterns in\ndata let me give you an example a neural\nnetwork trained to identify malignant\nskin lesions observed that many medical\nimages of cancerous lesions included a\nruler for scale instead of learning the\nnuanced differences between benign and\nmalignant lesions in terms of their\nmedical features it trained itself to\nlook for the presence of a ruler given\nthe trends in the training images so it\nmistakenly learned to associate the\npresence of a ruler in an image with the\nlikelihood of the lesion being malignant\nas a result the AI performed super well\nin the training data but when presented\nwith real world tumor images that didn't\nadhere to this ruler coincidence as you\ncould expect it failed miserably\nnot only is having broad training data\nimportant to building safe and effective\nAI but so is being able to track its\ndecision-making processes doing so\nenables the AI to learn General more\naccurate features and also helps\ndevelopers explain and fix pain points\nor causes of error\nAI is groundbreaking but not without its\nlimitations there are several challenges\nthat we've yet to overcome for large\nlanguage models to reach their full\npotential\nspeed is one of those gigantic models\npowerful but they're also slow faster\nresponse times will be necessary as we\naim to apply these Technologies in more\nproduction settings\nanother one would be bias large language\nmodels are trained on data from the\ninternet unfortunately that includes a\nlot of content warped by our human\nsubjectivity leading to lom's returning\nresults that reflect a lack of diversity\nas well as being capable of generating\nextremist content\neven software developers with the best\nintentions will unconsciously make\nchoices that cause AI to portray similar\nWorld Views\noutside of large language models one of\nthe most eye-opening studies that\nbrought this issue to the Forefront was\nconducted by propublica a non-profit\ninvestigative journalism organization\nthey looked into an algorithm used in\nthe U.S criminal justice system to\npredict which individuals are likely to\ncommit crimes again a concept known as\nrecidivism\nthe pro-publica study revealed that this\nrecidivism predicting algorithm\nhad a troubling bias against African\nAmericans in simple terms the algorithm\nwas more likely to wrongly predict that\nAfrican-American individuals would\ncommit future crimes compared to White\nindividuals on the flip side it was also\nmore likely to incorrectly assume that\nwhite individuals were at low risk of\nreoffending these inaccuracies are not\njust numbers they have real world\nconsequences such as unfavorably\nextended prison sentences or denied\nopportunities for parole this study\nserves as a wake-up call about the\nethical challenges in AI\nit emphasizes the need for fairness\ntransparency and accountability when we\nuse algorithms to make important\ndecisions especially in sensitive areas\nlike criminal justice\nthe findings from propublica have\nignited debates and calls for Action to\nrigorously evaluate an audit AI\nalgorithms ensuring they don't\nperpetuate existing societal biases it's\na stark reminder that as we move forward\nwith technological advancements we must\nalso be vigilant in safeguarding ethical\nstandards\nanother limitation is hallucinations\nwhen given a prompt it doesn't\nunderstand generative AI will often\nrespond absurdively with content that is\ncertified bull shark\nimportantly it's difficult to check the\nvalidity of such text it's a critical\nissue for large language models that\nmakes it very difficult to use them for\nfact checking and essay writing\nanother one plagiarism because the most\nnotable loms are trained on billions of\nparameters they have plenty of examples\nto draw from\nwhile many of the generated responses\nare legitimately original there are also\nsome that can be found verbatim on the\nweb\nthis makes large language models\nproblematic when used in academic\nsettings we must construct improved\nmechanisms for detecting and handling\nand plagiarism\nundesirable content is a huge limitation\nfor most of the web's history the\nmajority of content has been limited to\nwhat a human could author large language\nmodels remove that restriction\ndisinformation is the deliberate\nspreading of false or misleading\ninformation often with the intent to\ndeceive or manipulate public opinion the\ncapabilities of llms to generate text\nthat is indistinguishable from that\nwritten by humans have made them a\npowerful tool for propagating\ndisinformation\nfor example these models can be used to\ncreate fake news articles sometimes\ncalled read fakes false narratives or\nmisleading social media posts at a scale\nand speed that were previously\nunimaginable the danger here is not just\nthe volume of false information but also\nits potential to be a highly targeted\nand convincing thereby sowing Discord\nundermining trusts and institutions and\neven influencing things as important as\nelections\nwe're entering an era in which our\nenemies can make it look like anyone is\nsaying anything at any point in time\neven if they would never say those\nthings\nso\nfor instance they could have me say\nthings like\nI don't know\nkillmonger was right\ndeep fix take disinformation to another\nlevel by using deep learning algorithms\nto create hyper-realistic videos where\npeople appear to say or do things that\nthey never actually did\nthese manipulated videos can be\nincredibly convincing making it\ndifficult for the average viewer to\ndistinguish between what is real and\nwhat is fabricated\ndeep fakes have been used for various\nmalicious purposes from character\nassassination and fake news\ndissemination to fraud and blackmail\nthe technology poses a significant\nthreat to personal privacy and public\ntrust as it can be used to create\nentirely false narratives that are\nalmost impossible to debunk in a timely\nmanner\nboth disinformation and deep fix\nrepresent a dark side of artificial\nintelligence and machine learning\nTechnologies they underscore the urgent\nneed for ethical guidelines robust\nverification tools and public awareness\nto combat these emerging threats\nas these Technologies continue to evolve\nthe challenge will be to balance the\nincredible potential for Innovation and\npositive impact against the risks of\nmisuse and harm\ns you need a centerpiece 20 reps the\ntable called from

in my car if I keep anything\n[Music]\nwhen someone uses AI to write an article\nor create a painting or sing a song who\ndoes it belong to\ncan the person who generated at claim\nownership\nthere's a lot of new legal questions\nthat have yet to be answered by our\naging laws\nfor example if I train a model on your\npaintings and then it makes more that\nlook similar do I need to compensate you\nfor that\nor if I use samples of Taylor Swift's\nmusic to generate more pop or country do\nI owe her a songwriting credit\nmy current View\nshared by an awesome Professor who\nspecializes in copyright\nis that as of now ai generated images\nwill be considered derivative works of\nwhatever they were trained on\nanother limitation or thing to think\nabout is alignment our large language\nmodels aligned with human values and\nfollowing human intent we'll need to\ncontinue training AI systems using human\nfeedback to ensure that the systems\nwe're building bring about more positive\nthan negative consequences I'm going to\ndiscuss alignment further in a bit\nthe Black Box problem refers to the\nchallenge of understanding complex ml\nmodels imagine a model predicting credit\nworthiness where the input is the\napplicant's financial history and\nemployment status and the output is a\nrecommendation to approve or deny the\nloan\ndo you see the black box\nthe mathematical computations between\ninput and output are hidden often\ninvolving hundreds of variables and\nnon-linear transformations\nthis opacity can create ethical and\npractical challenges\nin healthcare if a model predicts a\ndisease doctors need to know why to\nprovide proper care\nin legal settings transparency is\nusually required for fairness\nthe Black Box problem represents the two\ncore issues that AI systems have if you\ntake only a few things away from this\ncourse let this be one of them\nwe do not understand why AI makes the\ndecisions that it does and once AI makes\na decision we do not know if that\ndecision was the best one\nthe issue is it's a feedback loop we're\nnot going to talk about predictive\npolicing much in this course but one\nrelevant application is when a police\ndepartment might use AI to determine\nwhere to send their patrol cars\nan AI model might determine that there\nare hot spots in three neighborhoods\nso the cops are sent to those three\nplaces they find crime they report back\nthere was crime success right\nexcept\nthey didn't go to the other places so\nthey won't know whether or not they\nwould have found crime going elsewhere\nAI is always right if you don't ever\ncheck if it's wrong\nsee why it's difficult to verify results\nhere's another example\na school system might use AI to\ndetermine which teachers to hire or fire\nlet's say it decides to fire one teacher\nsince the algorithm is a black box the\nteacher can't appeal to the system\nand because the teacher was fired we'll\nnever know if their students would have\nperformed better than next year\nthere may have been confounding\nvariables the AI didn't consider\nwe've discussed at length how AI works\nand now with the black box problem we're\nstarting to explore the ethical\nimplications bit\nbut first let's actually go over some\nethical and decision Frameworks that we\ncan then apply to artificial\nintelligence\nethical Frameworks serve as guiding\ncompasses in the complex landscape of\nmorality and ethics they're not just\ntheoretical constructs but deeply\ningrained in our culture legal systems\nand individual beliefs\nthese Frameworks help us navigate moral\ndilemmas providing tools to identify\nanalyze and resolve ethical issues\nin the context of AI they become\ninstrumental in guiding design\ndevelopment and deployment ensuring that\ntechnology aligns with our societal\nvalues and principles\nconsequentialism focuses on the outcomes\nor Consequences of actions assessing\nthem as right or wrong based on their\neffect a common form utilitarianism\nargues for maximizing happiness or\nwelfare across Society\nin the AI context a consequentialist\napproach might prioritize systems that\noptimize

and vital\nnature of this aspect of AI development\nnext we'll dive into the Turing test an\nidea so profound it has fundamentally\nshaped our understanding of artificial\nintelligence\nthere's a reason computers are also\nknown as Turing machines\npicture this you're in a conversation\nwith two unseen participants one human\nand the other a machine\nAlan Turing asks whether it's possible\nfor you to determine which is which\npurely based on their responses this is\nnot an intellectual game it's a quest to\ndefine the very nature of thought and\nunderstanding if a machine can respond\nlike a human is it thinking does it\npossess Consciousness or intellect what\ndoes this tell us about ourselves and\nthe nature of intelligence\nimagine you were the evaluator what\nquestions would you ask what answers\nwould convince you this isn't just about\ntechnology it's about redefining what it\nmeans to be sentient\nlet's try it\nconsider the following questions\nfirst\nhow do you feel when you

are just some of the questions\nthat Turing asks us\nnext up the Chinese room a thought\nexperiment somewhat rebutting the Turing\ntest\nimagine yourself inside a room filled\nwith Chinese symbols and a rule book for\nmanipulating them\nsomeone outside the room hands you\nmessages in Chinese under the door and\nusing the rule book or dictionary you\nrespond creating the illusion that you\nunderstand the language but inside the\nroom you have no understanding of\nChinese whatsoever you're just using a\ndictionary\nthe Chinese room challenges us to\nconsider the difference between\nsimulating understanding and genuine\ncomprehension\nwhat does it mean to troopy know\nsomething\ncan a machine ever understand or would\nonly ever simulate understanding\nhow do we distinguish between the\nappearance of intelligence and genuine\nconsciousness\nthese questions lead us down paths that\nquestion the very fabric of our thoughts\nand perceptions\nhave you ever known everything about\nsomething without experiencing it that's\nthe question at the heart of the black\nand white room experiment also known as\nMary's room\nimagine a scientist her name is Mary who\nknows every physical fact about color\nbut has never seen color herself\nshe lives in a black and white room and\nlearns everything through black and\nwhite resources like photographs or\nbooks and upon leaving the room and\nexperiencing color for the first time\ndoes she learn anything new\nthis thought experiment delves into the\nnature of understanding challenging our\nconcepts of objective knowledge and\nsubjective experience\nthe implications of this thought\nexperiment are far-reaching\ncan objective knowledge capture\nsubjective experience\nwhat does this mean for AI which can\npossess all factual knowledge but lacks\nall personal experience how do we\nreconcile these ideas in our own lives\nconsider deep blue and alphago the\nfamous chess and go AI

multi-disciplinary approach to ensure\nthat AI is developed and deployed\nresponsibly\nmoral status refers to the degree of\nvalue or worth attributed to an entity\nwithin ethical considerations\ndetermining how it should be treated and\nwhat rights and protections it should be\nafforded\nin the context of AI personhood moral\nstatus becomes a pivotal question if an\nAI system were to be granted moral\nstatus it would imply that the system\nhas intrinsic value independent of its\nutility to human beings and therefore\ndeserves ethical consideration\nthis challenges traditional Notions that\nonly beings with Consciousness emotions\nor the ability to suffer have moral\nstatus\nthe debate over the moral status of AI\nsystems touches on profound\nphilosophical inquiries into the nature\nof Consciousness sentience and existence\nit also raises questions for me at least\nabout what characteristics qualify as an\nentity for moral consideration and how\nthese might apply to non-human\nartificially created beings\nthe discussion of moral status in AI is\nnot just theoretical it has practical\nimplications for how we design use and\nregulate AI systems\nthink of Frankenstein for example\nreflecting these broader societal values\nand principles\nbut the question of personhood for AI is\nmore than just a legal or technical\nissue it's a profound ethical dilemma\nthat challenges our fundamental concepts\nof Rights obligations and empathy\nimagine a future where AI systems are\nautonomous exhibiting behaviors that we\nassociate with sentient beings like\nhumans\nshould we Grant ai's rights\nshould we afford them protections should\nwe afford them respect what criteria\nshould we use to determine moral legal\nstatus period how do we balance the\nneeds and rights of human beings with\nour responsibilities towards\nincreasingly sophisticated non-human\nentities especially if we made them\nthis is not a mere academic exercise\nit's a pressing moral challenge that\ncould reshape our laws our society and\nour relationship with technology\nhere are some arguments for and against\nfirst\nin favor of granting AI personhood\nproponents of grandeuring personhood to\nAI systems base their arguments on\nseveral compelling reasons\nfirst they point to the potential for\nadvanced AI to possess Consciousness or\nself-awareness thus deserving rights and\nProductions similar to humans\nthey also argue that recognizing ai's\npersonhood could prevent potential\nmistreatment or exploitation of Highly\nsophisticated systems\ngranting legal status to AI might\nfacilitate smoother interactions in\nlegal and Commercial environments making\nAI entities accountable and responsible\nin ways similar to corporations\nproponents also believe that personhood\nfor AI encourages ethical development\nand deployment ensuring that creators\nand users trust these systems with\nrespect and dignity\nfinally recognizing AI as entities with\ncertain rights might Foster empathy and\ncompassion leading to a more Humane\napproach to technology\nnow let's look at the\nopposing side against granting AI\npersonhood\nopponents of granting AI personhood\ncounter these arguments with several\nconcerns of Their Own\nfirst they contend that even the most\nadvanced AI lacks genuine emotions\nConsciousness or intentions and thus\ncannot be equated to humans and moral or\nbeagle terms or at the very least they\ncan't we can't prove it has\nConsciousness or not they also worry\nthat assigning personhood AI could\ndilute human rights undermining the\nunique moral status of human beings\nadditionally critics argue that AI\npersonhood might create legal and\nethical confusion blurring the lines\nbetween objects and subjects of law\nleading to unforeseen consequences\nopponents emphasize that granting AI\nlegal status might shift responsibility\naway from the human creators and users\nmaking accountability more challenging\nfurthermore they warned that equating AI\nwith personhood could lead to a very\nslippery slope where other none human\nentities might claim similar rights\nfurther complicating our legal and\nethical Frameworks\ntogether these arguments illustrate the\ncomplexities and nuances of the question\nof personhood for AI\nthey invite us to carefully consider the\nimplications of our technological\nadvancements and how they intersect with\nour legal and social norms\nthe reality is it's really difficult to\ntell if AI has Consciousness or\nsentience when we don't even agree on\nhow to define those terms\nmy personal belief is that the\ndifference between Ai and humans is not\nsomething we have but something we're\nlimited by\nin our human case that's time for AIS\nit's energy\nregardless the debate over AI personhood\nwill probably continue as the technology\nevolves prompting us to revisit and\npossibly even redefine our

patient\nconfidentiality becomes pretty big\npriority for example a breach in a\nHospital's patient record system could\nexpose sensitive information eroding\ntrust in the institution\nwe can also talk about bias in data sets\nAI systems can inadvertently perpetuate\nbiases if trained on skewed or\nnon-diverse data sets\nsome more specific examples could be\nrace bias where an AI model trained\nprimarily on Caucasian skin might\nmisdiagnose skin conditions in people\nwith darker skin tones\nor sex bias a lack of representation of\nwomen and certain medical data sets\ncould lead to inaccurate diagnoses and\ntreatment for female patients\nfor example heart disease system\nsymptoms might manifest differently in\nwomen but if the data is heavily biased\ntowards male participants the AI system\nmight Overlook these differences\nyou can also talk about age bias if an\nAI system is trained mainly on data from\nyounger patients it might struggle to\nrecognize and treat conditions that are\nmore prevalent or manifest differently\nand alter individuals informed consent\nis another issue patients must be\nadequately informed about how their data\nis used and have the opportunity to\nconsent to it without transparent\ncommunication there's a risk of\nundermining patient autonomy\naccessibility and equality is important\nbecause ensuring the AI driven\nHealthcare Solutions are available to\nall regardless of socioeconomic status\nis critical\ncompliance with legal regulations is\nreally important in healthcare\nhere are a couple major privacy laws\nthat AI systems currently need to comply\nwith\nthe first is called HIPAA the health\ninsurance portability and accountability\nact which in the United States\nsafeguards patients medical records and\nother health information setting the\nstandard for data privacy\nthe second is called gdpr General data\nprotection regulation which in Europe\nprotects and empowers all EU citizens\ndata privacy including health\ninformation

with\ncare responsibility and a focus on human\nwell-being\nnext we'll explore AI in the spirit of\neducation and the realm of personalized\nlearning AI is making strides by\ncreating customized educational plans\ntailored to individual students these\nplans adapt to students unique learning\nstyles and paces offering a more\nengaging and Effective Education at\ntimes for instance tools like

access to a personal tutor that's\nwhat AI can accomplish if developed and\ndeployed properly\nfitter Tom my organization which Seth\nintroduced earlier was able to\naccomplish this on a smaller scale using\nchatgpt we developed an application that\nuses the machine learning model behind\nthe tap gbt called gpt4 that allows\nstudents to generate curricula on any\ntopic from crowdsource content this\nplatform enabled us to ensure that\nreputable factual and accessible content\nwas streamlined to the students we\nbrought the tool along with free access\nto chat GPT plus from openai to nearly

it's important to\nrecognize and endress ethical concerns\nbiases are a significant issue mirroring\nsimilar challenges in healthcare if AI\nsystems are trained on biased data they\ncan inadvertently reinforce stereotypes\nand inequalities failing to cater\neffectively to a diverse student body\nfor instance gender biases and\nalgorithms could lead to differentiated\ntreatment male and female

take a\ncloser look at two significant\napplications algorithmic trading and\nfraud detection\nalgorithmic trading represents one of\nthe most striking uses of AI in finance\nby employing intricate algorithms hedge\nfunds and other financial institutions\ncan execute high frequency trading\nstrategies an example of this is hedge\nfunds that use artificial intelligence\ndriven algorithms to make a rapid buying\nand selling decisions capitalizing on my\nnew price changes this technology\nstreamlines trading but as we'll see it\nalso presents unique ethical dilemmas\nfraud detection is another compelling\napplication of AI in the financial World\nby monitoring the transactions in real\ntime AI can detect and prevent\nfraudulent activities enhancing the\nsecurity and integrity of our financial\nsystems credit card companies for\ninstance use sophisticated AI systems to\nspot suspicious transactions and act\nswiftly to protect customers\nthe integration of AI in finance has\nbrought with it several ethical concerns\nunique to the sector\nfirst let's discuss Market manipulation\nthe speed and sophistication of AI\ntraining algorithms present\nopportunities for manipulation\nthese algorithms can be employed to\ncreate false market trends or to spoof\nthe market where in large buy or sell\norders are placed and then quickly\ncanceled to deceive other Traders this\nkind of manipulation can lead to\ndistorted prices and undermine the\nIntegrity of financial markets\nit raises questions about transparency\nfairness and the adequacy of existing\nregulatory measures\ndata Securities another major concern\nin a world where personal and corporate\nfinancial information is entrusted to AI\nsystems the stakes for securing this\ndata are incredibly High\nbreaches can lead not only to financial\nloss but to a loss of trust in financial\ninstitutions and so protecting this data\nrequires an unprecedented level of\nsecurity measures robust encryption and\nconstant vigilance against ever-evolving\ncyber threats\nthe ethical responsibility extends to\nensuring the AI systems are transparent\nand how they handle data and comply with\nrelevant privacy laws\nanother issue centers around\naccountability and responsibility\nwith AI algorithms making critical\nfinancial decisions questions arise\nabout who is responsible when things go\nwrong\nit's the developers of the algorithms\nvisit the institutions using them or\nsomeone else\nthe lines of responsibility can be\nblurred complicating regulatory\noversight\nfinally we must think about issues of\neconomic inequality and accessibility as\nAI drives more financial decision making\nthere's a risk that those without access\nto these Technologies are left behind\nensuring that the benefits and\nprotections of AI and finance are\navailable to all not just the\ntechnologically advanced is an ethical\nimperative\nthe flash crash of 2010 serves as

consequences\njust as AI can displace jobs or lead to\nworker exploitation there has been a\ngrowing push for technology-based\nsolutions to economically support the\nmost vulnerable many of whom will find\ntheir jobs displaced without concessions\nfor upskilling or working in these\ndigital sweatshots\nleading this movement are initiatives\nlike the proposed AI windfall clause\nwhich suggests

ensuring equality and\naccessibility and AI tools across all\nsocioeconomic backgrounds it's a vital\nethical consideration\nthe application of AI and recruitment\noffers both exciting opportunities and\ncautionary tales\ncompanies like Unilever\nhave embraced AI achieving significant\ndeficiencies in time and cost\nhowever this promising landscape isn't\nwithout pitfalls Amazon's experience\noffers a critical case study\ntheir AI recruitment tool designed to\nstreamline the hiring process was found\nto be biased against women\ndespite efforts to correct the system\nthe biases persisted and Amazon\neventually abandoned the tool\nthis situation showed how a seemingly\nneutral algorithm can replicate human\nprejudices if not carefully managed it\nalso illustrates the very

Notions\nof fairness into quantifiable benchmarks\nthat machines can process how do we\nensure that models are safe trustworthy\nand reliable without hampering\nInnovation at a time when Global powers\nare approaching an AI arms race\nhow do we balance the desire for\nexplainable outcomes with the importance\nof intellectual property protections\nespecially when so many models are\nproprietary and most crucially as AI\nmodels become increasingly Advanced how\ndo we design agile structures of\ngovernance that can keep Pace learning\nto govern this moving Target is quickly\nbecoming one of the heftiest regulatory\nchallenges of our time\nresponsibility and accountability in the\nage of AI are multifaceted and complex\nwho takes the fall when an AI system\nfails or causes harm in the case of an\nautonomous vehicle the more important\nquestion isn't what the car does in some\nhypothetical trolley problem but who's\nresponsible in the aftermath is it the\ndeveloper who programmed the algorithms\nthe company that deployed it or perhaps\neven the AI system itself who volunteers\nas tribute this debate has profound\nimplications for law ethics and society\nas AI systems become more advanced and\nautonomous traditional legal Frameworks\nmay be insufficient to address new\nscenarios remember how we previously\ndiscussed legal personhood for AI here's\nanother reason that could be relevant if\nAIS were almost akin to corporations it\nwould open up an entirely new dimension\nof legal options understanding these\nintricacies is key to creating a\nresponsible AI driven future\nAI governance isn't just about legal\ncompliance it's about building a\nholistic ecosystem that balances the\nInnovative potential of AI with ethical\nconsiderations and societal needs\ninternal governance includes policies\nwithin an organization to guide AI\ndevelopment and use ensuring alignment\nwith ethical principles safety standards\nand societal values on the other hand\nexternal oversight incorporates\nthird-party audits certifications and\nRegulatory bodies that maintain industry\nstandards together these elements form a\ncohesive governance framework that\nsupports responsible AI development this\nmultifaceted approach recognizes that AI\nis not any one thing but rather a\ndiverse field of hearing applications\neach requiring nuanced understanding and\nregulation\nAI ethics codes and standards are\nfoundational in shaping the moral fabric\nof the technology various organizations\ngovernments and Industry groups are\nworking to develop these guidelines\nreflecting a concerted Global effort to\nalign AI development with human values\nthese codes not only address immediate\nethical concerns but also seek to\nanticipate future challenges and\npossibilities they often focus on\nprinciples like transparency\naccountability privacy and fairness the\ndevelopment of globally accepted\nstandards is an ongoing process\ninvolving continuous dialogue between\ntechnologists ethicists policy makers\nand the broader public it's an essential\nstep towards a future where AI serves as\na force for positive good\ngovernments around the world are\nactively grappling with how to regulate\nAi and their approaches vary widely the\nchallenge lies in creating policies that\npromote Innovation while protecting\ncitizens and upholding societal values\nsome governments encourage a free market\napproach fostering growth While others\nadopt more strict regulations to ensure\ncompliance and Public Safety This Global\nweb of AI policies reflects varying\ncultural political social and economic\ncontacts each contributing to a complex\ntapestry of Regulation\nthe United States defines its approach\nto AI regulation with the commitment to\nHuman Rights transparency and\naccountability emphasizing\nentrepreneurial spirit and Innovation\nthe U.S Fosters an environment conducive\nto AI advancement through programs like\nthe American artificial intelligence\ninitiative which focuses on R D\ninvestment and ethical guidelines and\nthrough consultation with a number of\nCivil Society groups the White House\nreleased a Bill of Rights to an\nautomated Society outlining principles\nfor the responsible development\nprovenance and use of AI systems in\naddition the White House notched an\nagreement with a number of leading Tech\nfirms like anthropic meta Google and\nopenai these companies signed on to\naccept a voluntary commitments including\nthings like stronger cyber security\nprotections and a watermarking system to\ndistinguish AI generated content\nfederal agencies including the National\nInstitute of Standards and Technology\nactively worked to develop standards and\nbest practices state governments\nalongside industry groups contribute to\nthis collaborative ecosystem through\nlocal regulations and initiatives\nsimultaneously the U.S recognizes the\nneed for ethical guard rails and\nprinciples like non-discrimination and\nAi and strives to balance Innovation\nwith the protection of these Democratic\nprinciples this Dynamic and multifaceted\napproach aims to make the U.S a global\nleader in AI setting Trends and\ninfluencing International Norms around\nits development\nthe European Union stance on AI\nregulation is characterized by a strong\nemphasis on privacy human rights and\ncomprehensive oversight the EU has been\nat the Forefront of crafting regulations\nlike the general data protection\nregulation or the gdpr which has set\nGlobal standards for data protection in\nApril 2021 the European commission\nproposed new rules specifically\ntargeting AI focusing on transparency\naccountability and risk management\nunlike a solely free market approach the\nEU integrates ethical considerations at\nevery stage of AI development seeking to\ncreate a landscape that reflects\nDemocratic Values initiatives like the\nhigh level expert group on

China's\napproach you must appreciate its blend\nof governance National priorities and\ncultural values which offer insights\ninto an alternative model of governance\nthe final AI policy and case study we're\ngoing to look at are the two schools of\nthought when it comes to approaching AI\nregulation\nin the rapidly progressing AI landscape\ntwo distinct viewpoints have become\nespecially pronounced the first are\nalgorithmic Justice and Freedom Fighters\nwith Advocates like Tim Nick gabru and\njoy buamuini they're concerned with the\nimmediate challenges of AI like\nalgorithmic fairness data privacy and\nthe displacement of jobs\non the other hand the long-termism group\noften linked to prominent figures like\nElon Musk contemplate the broader future\noriented implications especially the\npotential threats posed by strong Ai and\nsuper AI that might surpass human\ncapabilities and intentions\nwhile both groups are certainly\nchampioning valid concerns they're\ndiffering focal points can lead to\nfriction in both discourse and policy\npriorities those advocating for\nalgorithmic justice feel that the long\nterm is might sideline pressing social\nand ethical issues by concentrating on\nmore distant and speculative threats\nhowever in contrast long-termis\nemphasize preemptive measures to Stave\noff any catastrophic outcomes in the AI\ndriven future\nit's vital to recognize that the two\nperspectives can coexist and potentially\neven complement each other addressing\nalgorithmic justice issues today can\npave the way for AI alignment in the\nfuture ensuring that AI Technologies are\nboth fair and safe it's also worth\nnoting that skepticism towards\nlong-termism sometimes stems from the\nknowledge that some of the early figures\nin AI long-termism had racist beliefs\nthis historical backdrop underscores the\nimportance of prioritizing ethics and\ninclusivity in today's AI discussions\nirrespective of the group's primary\nfocus that being said we must be careful\nabout what we prioritize when it comes\nto regulation to ensure that both\nshort-term and long-term harms are\naccurately addressed and then redressed\n2023 marks the first ever Global AI\nsafety Summit held in London by UK prime\nminister Rishi sudok who committed\npublicly to making the UK the\ngeographical and intellectual home of AI\ngovernance the summit and future\niterations of it are dedicated to\nconvening leaders from around the world\nto craft regulations for Frontier AI\nmodels now more than ever\nintergovernmental coordination on AI has\nbecome Paramount an AI arms race May\nalready be underway between Global\npowers like the U.S and China buy-in\nfrom rival or states will be necessary\nto rein in AI development especially as\ncurrent uses like autonomous weapons and\nfuture ones like ai-powered cyber\nattacks threatened to undermine the\nworld's order the UN has even moved to\nestablish a high-level advisory body on\nartificial intelligence mirroring a\nsimilar body in the EU there is an\nincredibly wide range of regulatory\napproaches and human rights environments\nto consider for for instance with the AI\nact the EU has explicitly rejected\nai-based surveillance through\nTechnologies like facial recognition\nthough similar systems are still in use\nby number of governments around the\nworld it remains to be seen how exactly\ncompeting national interests and\nstrategies will shape Global AI\ngovernance\nthank you for joining me for this course\nup until this point\nas we look towards the future of AI and\nethical AI development we'll recap some\nessential themes challenges and\nopportunities\nfrom its applications in various sectors\nto the governing principles that must\nguide its evolution\nto bring together the insights we've\ngained throughout this course\nai's future is poised to be\ntransformative\nongoing advancements such as Quantum\nComputing are expanding ai's\ncapabilities while applications
