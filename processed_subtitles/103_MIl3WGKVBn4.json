You have this goal,\nyou have this idea of what it is that you,\nhow much weight you want to lose,\nand despite planning this\nout and thinking this out,\nyou end up not doing it.\nYou end up procrastinating.\nYou end up eating a bunch of\nfood that is not healthy for you.\nYou just end up watching TV or\nsomething other than exercising.\nSo how would you break that compulsion,\nthe Swish pattern?\nWhat it does is it gets inside that\nexperience of what it's like when you're\njust sort of following a,\na program and unconscious program that\nthat guide you to do something that you\ndon't really don't want to do, which is\nprocrastinate and eat unhealthy food.\nWhat normally happens is you're very\nassociated associated meaning when you\nthink about that, you're actually\nin the memory, you're, you're,\nyou're in the experience itself rather\nthan seeing yourself in the experience.\nSo that's normally how we feel\ncompelled to do something.\nAnd this is also the case\nwhen we experience trauma\nand people experienced post\ntraumatic stress disorder. It's because\nwhen they think about the experience,\nthey snap into it as f as if they're\nactually there. And so they feel, uh,\nfeel a compulsion to panic,\nto feel fear,\nto feel whatever it was\nthat they were experiencing.\nThe same thing happens with your habits.\nSo when you keep breaking your\nplans or breaking the, the,\nthe goal or the, the, the activities\nthat you want to do to achieve that goal.\nAnd instead you're, you're going,\nyou're falling back on old habits.\nIt's because you're overly associated\ninto that and you see chocolate and you\ncan't help yourself.\nYou just go for it.\nYou see any type of food\nthat you shouldn't be eating\nand you just go for him.\nAnd by the way,\nit doesn't have to be for just food.\nThis could be for any type of\nhabit you're trying to break.\nSo with the Swish pattern does,\nis you replace that very associated image\nof being compelled to do whatever it\nis that you don't want to do.\nWhatever that habit is.\nAnd you swish it with an image\nof yourself, an ideal you,\nwhere you see yourself rather than being\nassociated you suddenly it's suddenly\nswishes to the ideal you,\nthe person you want to become.\nNow the reason why this is so powerful\nis because most people are lacking a\nvision on the other side of what\nit is that is holding them back.\nAnd I'll do another video about this\nbecause what happens is people that say,\nokay, I have this problem, I I need\nto lose weight. I have this problem.\nI need to stop spending so much money.\nUh, you know, I have this problem,\nI keep doing this or I keep\ndoing that. Well, most people,\nthey only are focused on the problem.\nThey don't,\nthey don't have a vision on\nthe other side of that problem.\nSo with the switch pattern does,\nis it gives you a vision of the you,\nyou want to be on the\nother side of the problem.\nAnd this is tremendously motivational\nand gives you that vision to aspire to\nrather than just saying, I need to stop\neating so much if you're focused on,\nstop on stopping eating.\nSo much.\nThen you're focused on eating rather\nthan the vision of yourself on the other\nside of that. And when you\ncreate that vision of yourself,\nyou actually want it to be kind of vague.\nAnd then what I mean by that is you don't\nwant to have it con context specific\nand you don't want to have it with\nyou doing any specific behavior.\nThe reason for that is if you connect,\nnot eating the compulsion\nto eat with say exercise.\nSo you swish up an image\nof you exercising. Okay,\nthat'll work sometimes.\nBut what happens if you wake up in the\nmiddle of the night and you've got the\nmunchies and suddenly this image of you\nswitches up of you doing exercise when\nthe middle of night that's not\neven probable or likely to happen.\nSo you're likely to break this and not\ndoing the same thing happens for people\nwho smoke cigarettes that are\naddicted to cigarettes and they swish,\nthey use a swish pattern.\nAnd so they switched the compulsion\nto smoke to maybe doing exercise or to\nsomething else that with and were to\nwake up and say three in the morning and\nreally crave a cigarette. They're\nnot, not likely to go and do.\nSo you want this to be vague in general,\nno specific context,\nno specific behavior,\njust the ideal you.\nAnd so what you do is you reprogram this\nhabit by swishing the compulsion away\nor down. Or sometimes you can even explode\nit and throwing this image up of you,\nthe ideal you who you want to be.\nSo any time you feel compelled to go do\nthe habit or the thing that you don't\nwant to do,\nsuddenly you get this image of you that\nswishes up automatically without even\nhaving to think about it. And you\ngo, oh yeah, that's who I want to be,\nnot this other habit,\nwhich is now gone.\nAnd what's amazing about this is that\nwhen you actually do this process and\nyou've practiced it many times,\nit becomes unconscious.\nYou practice it enough to where\nyou don't even think about it.\nSo it becomes just as unconscious as a\ncompulsion was to do the thing that you\ndidn't want to do,\nthe habit that you didn't want.\nIt becomes a compulsive\nto become that ideal.\nYou the one who solved this problem,\nthe one who is whoever you want to be.\nIt's fascinating how well this works and\nmost people actually get this process\nwrong,\nwhich is why you need to watch the video\nthat's linked to this video about how\nto do it right.\nIn fact,\nI was taught this process wrong by some\nof the top NLP teachers in the world and\nit wasn't until my mentor Steve Andreas\npointed it out to me how I had this\nprocess wrong and when I changed it,\nthis process became so much\nmore effective and LP anchoring.\nMany people are really fascinated with\nNLP anchoring and then some people say,\noh, that's, that's nothing. It's\njust classical conditioning.\nThat's Pavlov's dogs.\nWhenever he rang the bell,\nthe dogs would salivate because he would\nring the bell and feed them and then\nall they had to do was just ring the\nbell and the dogs would salivate. Yes.\nThat anchoring is based on\nthat type of conditioning.\nBut before NLP came around,\nnobody was really using this to induce\nstates in themselves or induced states\nand other people.\nAnd whenever they were creating an LP\nand they were modeling these incredibly\neffective therapists,\nwhere they started to notice is that\nthese therapists were using this type of\nconditioning.\nBasically they were using their words or\na particular word or emphasis on a word\nor a touch to induce a\nstate in their clients.\nSo if they were working with their clients\nand they started to notice the client\ngoing into a particular resourceful state\nwhere they were sort of open and more\nlight and they felt more empowered, they\nmight reach over and touch the person,\nor they might say a word,\nand then they would repeat the touch\nor the word later to see if the person\nwould go into the state.\nAnd if they did and they knew that they\nwere anchored and so they would do this\npurposefully to put the person in that\nstate and the founders of NLP realized,\nwell, we can do this to\nourselves. Probably the most\nsuccessful student of NLP,\nTony Robbins uses anchors a lot.\nIf you see him slap his hands like this,\nthat's an anchor that he has to\nput them into a certain state.\nYou'll see him hit his chest a lot.\nThat's an anchor for him as well.\nSo you can use anchors on yourself\nto induce particular states,\nresourceful states that you want to be in,\nespecially if you're about\nto give a presentation,\nyou could touch wherever you put your\nanchor at and go into that resource will\nstay whenever you give that presentation.\nNow this can also be used in persuasion\nto put people in the states that make\nthem more likely to buy from you.\nAnd some people can get very,\nvery clever with this and\nthey can actually anchor\npeople with their eyebrows.\nUm, they can make a certain face when\nthey notice a person is going into a\nparticular state.\nSo all they have to do is make that face\nagain at the person and they will go in.\nThey will be anchored to that.\nAnd then we'll go into that.\nState might be thinking, well, how\ndo I do this? Actually you can start.\nThe first step to being good at anchoring\nis to recognize how you're already\nanchored and your own life.\nYou go into the room,\nyou go into the bathroom and suddenly\nyou feel like you have to go.\nEven though before you stepped into it,\nyou didn't feel that at all.\nThat's an anchor. So we have spatial\nanchors as well are somebody,\nyou see somebody smile a certain\nway, like uh, the, your partner,\nyou see them smile a certain way and\nsuddenly you get these feelings that are\ntriggered and it's not just any smile,\nit's a very particular smile.\nSo start noticing how you're already\nanchored and everyday life and notice how\nyou may have anchored\nother people around you.\nThere's a really funny skit or a\nreally funny segment, and the office,\nthe American version of the office\nwhere one of the characters,\nevery time he boots up his computer\nand the sound comes on like God,\nit's like a Microsoft sound, like a\nlittle jingle comes up. He offers his,\nuh, his coworker across from him an\nAltoid. And so every time he does that,\nhe offers him the outside.\nHe does this enough times that finally\none time he just boots up his computer\nand he doesn't even offer\nhis coworker and alto,\nbut the coworker opens up his\nhand ready for the altcoin.\nThat would be an example of he\nanchored his coworker to that sound.\nSo you can anchor with touches,\nyou can anchor with sounds and you can\neven anchor with tastes and smells.\nIf you've ever walked down a street and\nyou smelled a certain smell and they\nbrought you back to another time or\nbrought you back to another feeling.\nI get this a lot whenever I smelled books,\nI think of memories that I've had in\nlibraries or memories that I've had when I\nwas in school.\nOr you can maybe taste something and it\nreminds you of your grandmother's a dish\nthat she used to make for you that that\nwas your favorite dish and it brings you\nback. It brings back all\nthose memories. Well,\nyou're just taking all this stuff\nthat you're naturally doing anyway.\nWhen you associate sounds,\ntouches and smells and tastes to states,\nand you're doing this on purpose so that\nyou can then engineer the states that\nyou want to experience, especially\nwhen you want to experience them.\nIt's about getting more\ncontrol over your states.\nNLP is also very well known for\nlanguage patterns, so language patterns.\nThat's the l and NLP neural linguistic\nprogramming language is basically the\ncode of how we think when we think we\noften think of thoughts as language.\nWe think of words a lot of times\nthat our thoughts, our words,\nand just by listening to\nsomeone's language patterns.\nWhen you start to learn NLP and\nyou start to learn these patterns,\nit starts to give you a map of their\nreality and you can also turn this on\nyourself of course and listen to your\nown language and then you can start,\nyou can start to understand how you\ncreate that map of reality for yourself.\nNow you might be thinking,\nwhat do you mean by map of reality?\nWe don't interact with reality directly.\nWe interact with reality\nthrough our filters and the\nfirst filters that we have,\nour five senses, there may be more\nto reality but we can't sense it.\nWe can only sense through five different\nsenses and so once we receive this\ninformation, we have to coat it in\norder to make sense of it and we also,\nwe can't take it in all at once.\nWe can't take in 100% of all sensory\nbased information all at once.\nIt would be too overwhelming.\nWe wouldn't be able to make\nsense of the information,\nwe wouldn't be able to make decisions.\nSo we have to code it,\nwe have to limit it, we have to delete\nsome of it. We have to distort some of it.\nWe have to generalize some of it. And\nlanguage is a huge part of how we do this.\nAnd so NLP language patterns is a way of\nunderstanding how you're creating your\nreality. Your language is a huge clue to\nthat and how other people are doing it.\nAnd once you understand how you create\nyour own reality, then you can change it.\nAnd this is what makes\nNLP so extraordinary.\nAnd then if you noticing it and other\npeople, you can help them as a therapist,\nyou can help them as a coach are.\nYou can persuade them if you're in sales,\nif you start to understand how they're\nconstructed reality, then you can better,\nyou're better able to influence\nthem to shift it into change it.\nNLP eye movement patterns are NLP eye\naccessing cues are also something NLP is\nvery well known for.\nAnd then it starts to get a little,\nbecause people start to say that you\ncan detect liars are people when they're\nlying by their eye movements.\nAnd I would say not quite.\nIt's one piece of evidence that can\nhelp you in detecting deception.\nBut I wouldn't depend\nonly on eye movements.\nSo what they found in NLP is that we\nlook in certain directions when we're\naccessing certain neurology or when\nwe're accessing certain sensory\nrepresentations,\nsensory internal sensory representations.\nSo for example, you see images\nin your head or in your mind,\nyou see movies in your mind, you hear\nthings in your mind, you can, you know,\nwhen you think of your memories, you're\nrecreating them in your, in your mind,\nyou're not accessing externally,\nthey're coming from within.\nSo these are things that you can see,\nhear,\nfeel what you can do all the five senses\ninternally and represent those. So,\nand NLP would they started the fine\nwas that we tend to look in certain\ndirections depending on what\nwe're accessing. So for example,\nif I'm constructing an image in my mind,\nsomething I've never seen before,\nbut it's something I'm imagining,\nI will tend to look up into my right.\nIf I'm remembering something I've seen\nbefore, I will tend to look up to my left.\nIf I'm hearing something, I will tend\nto look in either direction of my ears.\nTypically to the right one,\nI'm creating something the left when I'm\nremembering something and then I looked\ndown to my right when I'm accessing either\nemotional feelings are feelings in my\nbody. I looked down to my left\nwhen I'm talking to myself.\nThat's the internal dialogue.\nNow here's the problem with this is,\nand I'm going to do a\ncomplete video on this,\non how to overcome the problems of this.\nThe problem with this is we\ncan do a variety of things.\nIf I'm associated into an image,\njust like I was talking\nabout with the Swish pattern,\nI can feel like I'm actually in the\nmemory and if I'm actually in the memory,\nthen I may look to my right or to my\nleft as if I'm looking at the person who\nwas in the memory who was next to me.\nAnd that doesn't mean I'm\nhearing something. That means\nI'm actually in my mind,\nin the memory looking at the person.\nAnd then there's also a timeline,\nand I'll do a video on\nthis too. Um, when we look,\nwhen we have our timelines and some\npeople put their timelines out in front of\nthem,\nI may be looking to my past\nor to my future and that\ncan affect my eye movements\nas well. The thing they\nremember about eye movement,\nso is to track them with the person that\nyou're working with and you can start\nto again understand how\nthey're creating their reality.\nWhere are they putting their images,\nhow are they accessing memories?\nAnd when you start to understand this\nagain and it gives you a tremendous amount\nof influence.\nNow to use it on yourself,\nwhich you can also do is if you find that\nyou're dealing with a problem in your\neye,\nmovements go to one specific direction\nevery time you experienced that problem,\nevery time you think about that problem,\ntry moving your eyes to the opposite\ndirection or at any other place besides\nthat one.\nAnd think about the problem that this\nis really fascinating because you're\naccessing different neurology\nin a different part of\nyour mind and your brain.\nA lot of times you will find\nthe solution you looking for.\nThe problem was is the stuckness was you\nwere stuck accessing only a very small\npart of your neurology.\nBut when you access the problem within\nyourself and you start going to different\nparts of your neurology,\na lot of times you can find the solution\nto it right there and it feels like you\nbecome unstuck and you find what it is\nthe answer to whatever the problem was\nthat you were stuck in.\nValues elicitation is probably one of the\nmore overlooked but extremely powerful\ntechniques in an LP would\nvalues elicitation does,\nis it makes you realize what motivates\nyou and it makes you realize that\nwhatever you, whatever you\nthink you want on the surface,\nthat there's so much more to it.\nAnd the more you can understand that,\nthe more you can already\naccess it within yourself.\nThe building block of NLP was the\npresent state versus the desired state.\nSo I have a present state,\nwhich is, I want something,\nwhich means I feel like\nI'm in lack or scarcity.\nThe desired state is I get what I want.\nSo let's say I want to make\n$1 million. So my desires, my,\nmy present state is\nI'm lacking $1 million.\nSo the desired state would be what\n$1 million will make me feel like,\nokay,\nnotice I said the desired\nstate and feeling of what\n$1 million will make me feel\nbecause we don't actually have\nany use for money at all. As a,\nas a substance, as a\ngreen paper, it's nothing.\nIt's the value we project onto it and\ncumulatively we project value onto money,\nbut it's not the same for all of us.\n$100 to a beggar or a person or a person\nwho is homeless is going to be a lot,\nis going to have a lot more value than\na millionaire. When a millionaire,\nit looks at $100 versus\nthe homeless person.\nThere's a distinct difference\nbetween the value of that money.\nSo it's completely subjective when,\nso when you think about the,\nthe goals that you want to achieve,\nthe success that you want you,\na lot of people think that it's the thing\nthat will get them, that the new car,\nthe big house, the trophy wife, whatever\nit is, you start asking a question,\nokay, we'll, what would $1 million to do\nfor me? What would a new car do for me?\nWhat's important about a new house?\nAnd now I have to sort of detach from\nthe object and go deeper into what are my\nvalues about that? What is, what is the\nvalue that I'm projecting onto that?\nAnd eventually if you keep this up,\nyou will understand that a lot of this\nwill lead to a lot of the things that you\nwant actually lead to high level\nvalues like peace, happiness and joy.\nAnd then you have to ask yourself,\nwell wait a minute, can I access peace,\njoy and happiness within myself now?\nAnd then if I can do that,\ndoes it make it easier for me or\nharder for me to get what I want now?\nI think I know, I think you\nknow what the answer to that is.\nIf I can access these high level values\nwithin myself now and we all can at any\ntime,\neven though it may not feel that way,\nbut if I can access that now and then go\nafter the million dollars feeling happy\nand whole and fulfilled and\nat peace with myself, yeah,\nit's going to be a lot easier to get\nthat million dollars or that new car or\nthat new house. So this is why\nvalues elicitation is so powerful.\nIt also lets you know what is\nmotivating you and how do you draw,\nhow do you connect the\ndots from the material,\na material object or the goal that\nyou want to achieve or the outcome to\nfulfillment of your highest values.\nAnd when you're fulfilling\nyour highest values,\nthat's when life takes on purpose\nmeaning and all that joy and happiness,\nwhat you're seeking, your, you\nbecome the living embodiment of that.\nSo that's what we're really after.\nIt just on the surface level consciously,\nit seems like we want all these objects.\nSo we went all these things or we want\nall these achievements and all of those\nthings are great. There's nothing\nwrong with any of those things.\nBut if you're going to go after them,\nyou may as well go after them accessing\nthose values already feeling happy,\nwhole abundant and wealthy now,\nand then go after your goals.\nAnd it'll make us so much easier.\nAnd it actually makes it\nextremely enjoyable instead\nof what a lot of people are\ndoing,\nwhich is they withhold joy and pleasure\nfor themselves as they go after a goal.\nI can't be happy until I have this.\nI can't feel joy and,\nand I can't be at peace\nuntil I achieved this.\nYou're just cutting off all of those\nresources in that wonderful state that\nwould help enable you to get that.\nAnd so now you've just made\nit so much harder for you.\nSo values elicitation gets your mind on\nthe other side of achieving what it is\nthat you want.\nAnd when you come from that place,\nachieving what you want becomes show\nmuch easier and so much more enjoyable.\nSo like I said,\nif you want to go deeper with any\none are all of these NLP techniques,\ncheck the card that's\nlinked to this video.\nAlso check the description and put it\nin a comment below a list of the video\nlinks.\nSo it's easy for you to access.\nNow you're familiar with these neuro\nlinguistic programming techniques,\nbut it's going to be really difficult for\nyou to use them effectively unless you\ntake this deeper.\nAnd so what I've done is I've\ncreated a four part video series,\nwhich is a wonderful introduction\nto NLP and it's for free.\nAnd I put the link right down here in\nthe description so you can just click the\nlink,\nsign on for the free training and get\nthis introduction and it'll really help\nyou understand neuro\nlinguistic programming is for\nyou if it's something that\nyou want to study.\nHave you actually tried any of\nthese techniques and processes?\nIf you have,\nI would like to know about what your\nexperiences of using these processes and\ntechniques. So go ahead and tell me about\nit right here in the comments below.\nRemember to take advantage of this\nfree four part NLP video series.\nI'm not sure how long I will keep it up,\nbut as of the creation,\nthe creation of this video,\nit is available to you right now.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nmake sure you hit that subscribe button\nand the bell so that you'll know when I\nupload new videos and think about a\nfriend who you think would really benefit\nfrom this video, and go ahead and share it\nwith them.
