  "text": "dead nerds in this video we're going to\nbe going over what I'm learning as a\ndata analyst in 2024 we're not only\ngoing to be covering the core skills\nthat are necessary to land a job we're\nalso going to be focusing on other tools\nduring this AI Revolution that we're in\na lot of the top analytical tools have\nbeen stagnant in development for years\nnow however there have been a lot of\nupgrades this past year to help\nstreamline analytics last year I built\nan entire data analyst portfolio Project\nwithout writing a single line of code so\nthe barrier to entry to become a data\nanalyst and actually analyze data is\ngetting lower and lower now if you're\nnew here I'm Luke a data analyst my\nChannel's all about tech and skills for\ndata science and previously in a past\nlife I've worked as a data analyst in a\nvariety of roles from Corporate America\nall the way to last year working for the\nnumber one YouTuber Mr Beast now prior\nto this 5 years ago before I was a data\nanalysts I was transitioning out of the\nmilitary where I served on submarines\nand it turns out in the civilian world\nthere's not a lot of Need for these type\nof skills but I love data and I decided\nto go this route I loved it so much that\nI started this YouTube channel to share\nmy findings I've interviewed countless\nother data nerds in this journey and\nI've started to see the effect of these\nnew AI Technologies on our job so I\nwanted to put together this video in\norder to roadmap what tools I think you\nshould be learning as a data analyst and\nthat I'll be sharing on this channel as\nwell but before we get into any\nfuturistic tools we need to look at what\nare the core tools that a data analyst\nshould just generally know for their job\nso as that analyst let's look at some\ndata here's my app data nerd. Tech not\ntalk about it way too much anyway it\nAggregates job postings for data nerds\nand here I have the top skills listed in\njob postings for data analysts first is\nthe most popular skill of SQL or if\nyou're not a lazy English speaker SQL\nnow this is the programming language in\norder to communicate with a database and\nif you look at this there's a whack\nof databases in order for you to choose\nfrom which one do you choose well we're\nin that in a bit so SQL tops the list as\nthe most important skill of data analyst\nand also a lot of different data nerds\nanyway it's in almost half of all\nposting next up is Excel our favorite\nspreadsheet software that is a tool that\nshould be used for ad hoc analysis in\norder to do some quick calculations but\ninstead companies are using it in ways\nthat it shouldn't be using it and\ncausing it to be a little overhype and\nthis hype causes it to be the second\nmost important skill as it's listed in\nonethird of job postings next up are\ncoding languages which here we have\nPython and R now both these tools in my\nopinion are used to flex on your Excel\nco-workers that don't know how to code\nand unlike Excel with some of these\nlanguages you can do everything from\nAdvanced Analytics all the way to\nmachine learning and it's this reason\nthat chatbots are using popular language\nlike python to perform analytics behind\nthe scenes anyway for R they're only in\nabout one of six jobs but for python\nthey're coming close to Excel and almost\na third and last up on this list are\nvisualization tools specifically Tableau\nand powerbi these type of tools help you\nbuild interactive dashboards and\nvisualizations for your non-data nerd\nfriend I've spent weak building some\ndashboards that my co-workers never use\nso now that we have these top tools out\nof the way let's actually dive into what\nI'm going to be learning in inside of\neach of these tools and how I'm applying\nAI to each all right first up is SQL and\nfor diving into each one of these\nTechnologies we're going to be\nreferencing the 20123 developer survey\nfrom stack Overflow it surveys over\n90,000 developers and has insights into\nleading Technologies now I've tried out\nand used a lot of the different popular\noptions here on this list so which of\nthese am I going to focus on this year\nmore importantly that you should learn\nwell if we actually adjust this Poll for\nprofessional developers we see that\npostgress is topping the list however\nwhen sorting for those learning to code\nmy SQL tops the list by far postgress is\nnow down in fourth plate now MySQL is a\nlot more beginner friendly whereas\npostgress is a bit more advanced that's\nwhy we're seeing professional developers\nuse it more so which one am I going with\nwell there's also this poll on admired\nand desired desired is the proportion of\nrespondents who want to use a technology\nand admired are those that have used the\nsame technology in the past year and\nwant to continue do so for this\npostgress dominates the field not only\nis it the most desired but it's also the\nmost admired I tend to weigh the admired\nscore more because I want to understand\nwhat developers are actually using and\nwhat they want to continue to use and\nwith this it's pretty clear they want to\nuse postgress and not MySQL but as a\nbeginner I don't think you should be\nworried about whether you're going to\npick the right database to start with if\nyou actually dive into the Syntax for\npopular queries for both of these\noptions you find that they're actually\npretty much the same so if you learn the\nbasics of MySQL you can apply that to\npostgress so what exactly then am I\ngoing to be focusing on with SQL if that\nsyntax doesn't really matter well I'm\ntrying to learn how to use AI to speed\nup my work flow with writing SQL queries\nright now I'm using the AI coding\nassistant GitHub co-pilot in order to do\nthis but I think I'm missing something\nyes it can autocomplete along with\nanswering my questions regarding queries\nbut I feel like there's so much more\npreviously I was using chat gbt and now\na deprecated plugin notable all I had to\ndo was ask it a question and it would\ngenerate the SQL on its own to query the\ndatabase I didn't even have to know SQL\nbut that notable plugin got cancelled\nlast year and it ruined my entire course\nthat I built on chat gbt that was a\nwhole another story so now actually\nlooking for understanding what other\ntools are available to interact with SQL\nto speed up my workflow so I'll be\nexploring that this year on this channel\nall right next up is Microsoft Excel\nthere were two major advancements last\nyear Microsoft 365 co-pilot and python\nin Excel and they're both kind of\nrelated let me explain first up is\nco-pilot Microsoft teamed up with open\nAI as they found out that chat gbt is\nbasically a freak in the sheets they\ncall this freak Microsoft 365 co-pilot\nwith this you can not only ask it\nquestions about your data of which it\nwill provide some surface level insights\nbut the more important thing is it\nactually can dive into the data\nanalyzing it and providing graphs For\nYou released last November it will cost\nyou an additional 30 bucks on top of\nyour current Microsoft subscription\nhowever there's just one big catch\nMicrosoft is only allowing those that\nbuy a minimum of 300 licenses to access\nthis Advanced tool doing some math only\nhave to spend $113,000 a month in order\nto get this feature anyway the second\nmajor feature inside of excel is the\nintroduction of python this allows you\nto as you guessed it run python in Excel\nnow be honest most of the stuff you can\ndo with this new feature you can already\ndo with vanilla Excel so why was this\nreleased now when both these\ntechnologies have been available for\ndecades well my theory is that was\nreally released to support making it\neasier to do calculations inside of\nexcel if you recall how chat Bots are\nnow using python for calculations well\nthat's exactly what Microsoft has built\nhere to support calculations inside of\nexcel anyway I'm excited to dive into\nthis Microsoft 365 co-pilot as soon as\nthey remove that 300C limit in order to\nbetter understand how to use use this\ntool and better control Excel and the\nintegration of python which I think it\ndoubles down on the importance of\nlearning python which the next thing\nwe're going to cover is programming\nlanguage so for this we have two options\nPython and R which one should you learn\nwell personally I started with r and I\nthink it's a great easy tolearn language\nto start with and the Google data\nanalytics certificate which I'm a big\nfan of for beginners also agrees with\nthis but as I've progressed in my career\nI've needed a more advanced tool python\nis a multi-purpose language whereas R is\nspecifically designed for analytics and\ncan't do a lot of the stuff that python\ncan do whereas the vice versa is true\nshoot this entire app of data nerd. Tech\nwas built using python from the data\nscraped from the internet to displaying\nit on this screen R couldn't have done\nthis and that's part of my goal this\nyear and using AI with python to build\nout this app even more and there were a\nlot of advancements last year with AI\ncoding assistants not only they good at\nspeeding up your workflow but they're\nalso good at helping you learn a\nprogramming language so GitHub co-pilot\ntops the list and is popular among not\nonly professionals but also those\nlearning to code but after this poll was\nreleased there's been a lot of big\ndevelopments at the end of last year and\na lot of competitors specifically Google\njust introduced their new coding\nassistant called Duet AI which not only\nworks inside of things like VSS code and\npy charm but you're also able to use\nthis assistant inside of your different\nGoogle workspaces Now the other one I'm\nkeeping my eye on is from the team\nbehind the popular python IDE p now the\nteam at jet brains just rolled out this\ntool that has a lot of similar\nfunctionality to duet aai and GitHub\ncopilot so I'm going be testing out this\nyear all these assistants to find out\nwhich one is the best AI assistant but\nmore importantly I'm interested in\nlearning about how I can use these AI\nassistants to learn a programming\nlanguage and then share it with you so\nstay tuned it has some futural tutorials\non how to learn things like Python and\nalso SQL while using AI tools to speed\nup your learnings all right with that\nlet's get into the next one of VIs tools\nwith the similar programming languages\nyou have two popular options should you\nlearn powerbi or Tableau I'm biased to\npowerbi cuz I think it's a little bit\nmore Superior with its integration of\npower query and also dax's functionality\nthis allows me to clean and access data\nmuch more easily the problem with\npowerbi is that it doesn't have a strong\nCommunity when it comes to sharing\ndashboards whereas Tableau leads in this\narea with Tableau public as it is a\nresource for you to go and share your\nwork with the community anyway both\nthese stagnant tools both got some major\nAI upgrades this year power bi\nintroduced a very basic version of\nco-pilot inside of this app and this\nallows you to write Dax functionality\nand so it saves me a lot of time from\nhaving to jump back into chat gbt and\nthen back into powerbi now this is only\na limited feature of co-pilot as\nMicrosoft has shown that they're plan to\nintegrate it fully into powerbi to help\neven build out dashboards and that would\nbe a GameChanger now Tableau has also\ngotten some upgrades this year although\nthey haven't been as vocal I feel as\npowerbi well mostly tableau's parent\ncompany is Salesforce and their CEO\ntried to poach members of the open AI\nteam during the whole Sam Alman Fiasco\nback in November bold move cotton now\nTableau and also Salesforce are not new\nto AI they've been trying to develop\ntheir Einstein analytics now for years\nand they're building out their\ncompetitor Tableau GPT which basically\nallows you to use natural language in\norder to analyze data so when we look at\nall the top tools of a data analyst we\ncan see that they're affected greatly by\nall these different AI advancements now\nthere's something not on this list that\nwould be remiss if we didn't talk about\nand stack overflow beat me to the punch\nby including this new section on AI\nsearch Tools in their survey this year\nit's pretty clear from these results\nthat Chad gbt is dominating the field we\nshould basically also consider it taking\nup the second spot as well as being AI\nis basically chat gbt now although it's\nbeen the dominant player Google is\ntrying to catch up as they recently\nlaunched Gemini which they're saying is\ncompetitive with open ai's models\nalthough they fold us all with this\nHands-On demonstration I still think\nit's promising it's even been leaked\nrecently that they have an advanced\nversion similar to that of Chad gbt Plus\nso competition is heating up another one\nI've been testing recently is perplexity\nwhich I'm finding is replacing my normal\nworkflow of going to Google instead I'm\nusing this as not only it provides a\nquick summary of what I need but also\nlinks to all the different sources and\nit's fast AF the space cowboy himself\nJeff Bezos invested in perplexity\nrecently now valuing this company at\nhalf a billion dollars now for all these\nchat Bots and AI assistants that been\nspeaking of they're all powered by large\nlanguage models or llms and all the ones\nI spoke of previously are closed Source\nbut I think there's hope for the open-\nsource LOL Community the leading\ncompetitor in this space mistal AI just\nclosed its last funding round at $415\nmillion valuating the company at almost\n$2 billion now this is crazy that a\ncompany is valued this high and their\nmain product is available for you to\njust download and use for free anyway\nI'm really eager about developments in\nthe open-source Community because this\nallows two great things one is improve\ndata security\nnow I can take these large language\nmodels and host them locally process my\ndata locally and I don't have to worry\nabout Sam Alman stealing it additionally\nif I'm hosting this model locally I\ndon't have to pay Sam a subscription fee\nI just have to pay my own server fees\nand I think this is a win-win now with\nall these different AI advancements that\nI've been covering to this video you're\nprobably a little worried that this is\ngoing to replace your job as a data\nanalyst well let's look at these words\nfrom Sadia nadela and today we have a\nvision for a c-ai pilot that can Empower\nevery person and every organization on\nthe planet to achieve more and countless\nother Business Leaders and CEOs have\nechoed these same claims these AI\nassistants aren't being made to replace\nyou in your job but instead they're made\nto actually assist you in your jobs and\na recent KPMG survey shows this in it\nthey ask Business Leaders how generative\nAI will impact their headcount within an\norganization and over half expected to\nexpand the number of people in their\norganization most notably some of the\nmost popular roles they intended to add\nwere around data scientist and analyst\nwe have data to support that AI is not\nnecessarily going to take our job and\ninstead Business Leaders want us to use\nit on top of this Harvard released this\nstudy which tested those that used AI in\ntheir jobs against those that don't use\nAi and spoiler alert Consultants using\nAI were significantly more productive\nthey completed 12.2% more tasks on\naverage and complete a task 25.1% more\nquickly and produced significantly High\nhigher quality results more than 40%\nhigher quality compared to a control\ngrip so I think the DAT is pretty clear\nnot only is AI here to stay but it's\nhere to improve our jobs all right if\nyou'd like to learn more about how I\nwould go about learning to be a data\nanalyst check out this video right here\nand with that I'll see you in the next\none\n",
