  "text": "let's learn about introduction and\noverview of the sa sap analytics Cloud\nso what is sap analytics Cloud sap\nanalytics cloud is an saps Flagship\nproduct in the over overall analytics\nportfolio which uh which is a single\nanalytics Pro product uh which covers\nmultiple aspects of the business\nintelligence planning predictive and\napplication building this is a single\nproduct which SCP has come up with and\nhas powerful features which which covers\nmany of the areas and which is very um\npowerful for the business uh users this\nis an overview of the product which says\nwhat what it contains about the sap\nAntics Cloud so whatever you see here\nsap Antics Cloud which is having some\ndigital Board Room mobile and analytics\nHub are the components but uh the most\nimportant aspects are this business\nintelligence planning recording and\napplication design business intelligence\nwill cover most of the things related to\nthe report side or the stor telling\nwhich is creating a stories then\nplanning cover covering um sharing the\nsimulation of different charts we are\ncreating predictive is about the\nforecasting automated insights so\nwhatever the forecasting uh to be done\ncan be done with the predictive um\ncomponents here and application design\nis for the custom applications which\nwhich is based on the SDK extensions and\nthis analytics Cloud uh or SS uh is the\ntool which is based in the cloud and\nthis Cloud can be an on premise or\nhybrid or Cloud on premise means the\ncloud which is hosted on the premises of\nwhatever uh the organization is having\nhybrid is consisting of the cloud and\nboth Cloud means it is hosted by the sap\ncloud system so why sap Antics cloud is\nimportant and what is the business uh\nfor sap Antics cloud in uh today's word\nto in terms of the change happening over\nthe data uh you can see means data\ndriven organizations uh happening\ndigital transformation then it comes to\ndata and intelligence at the center\nbased on the data what are the different\nanalysis we can do do and what are the\ndifferent types of decisions can be\ntaken uh so it all depends upon the data\nso that is the first uh point of uh for\nbusiness uh for the sap Antics Cloud uh\nso\nthe data growth which is happening like\nyou you can see from this uh figure\nwhich says new data types or larger\nvolume and new locations coming there\nare some experience data and operational\ndata and that all comes to different\ndifferent areas one is analytics then\nBig Data iot IML blockchain so we as sap\nAntics cloud is focused on here which is\nin analytics\narea it starts from the data and the\ninformation collected from different\ndifferent business areas and uh from\nthis data and information the insight\nhas been taken and um it provides an\naction and lastly uh the value value is\nthe important uh aspect of the any of\nthe\norganization what are the data we are\nhaving what are the information we are\ncreating and what are the Insight we are\ngetting from the tool and then what are\nthe actions we are suggesting for the\nbusiness so based on the action\ntaken by the business users what are the\nlastly what are the values they are\ngetting so this is important to\nunderstand decision making evaluation so\nif you see means the uh earlier uh\ndecision making how it it it was\nhappening like linear then Dynamic and\naugmented so linear means will be\nhistorical and then it depends upon the\nstatic it has topown approach and it was\ncostly so it came then later came about\nthe dynamic which was self-service it\nwas having fast iterations but\ndistributed so depending upon the\ndifferent different areas it was\ndistributed based on the data it was\nhaving then uh now the\narea the focus should be on augmented\nanalytics\nor artificial intelligence d one so it\nit happens instant adjustment and it is\na continuous so the last step here which\nis given plan discover analyze PR\npredict act and plan so this is very\nimportant so based on the current data\nwhat is the plan what is the Discovery\nwe can do means based on the data what\nare the analysis we can do and then what\nare the predictions we can make for next\n6 months or next uh one year or three\nyear or five year plan so that that's\nwhat it depends upon and the actions or\nthe ACT we are going to provide so that\nthe business can plan so this is a\niterative now in the today's word who is\ndoing what so data engineers in data\ndata analysis analyst and scientists\nanalyzing the data decision makers\nreceive the analysis data and take\ndecisions and employees receive the\ndecision and act accordingly so these\nare the four important um stakeholders\nfor the sap Antics Cloud uh so who who\nare important to this and all these\ntools no no any other tools like no no\ntools provide all of the above features\nat the same time so it depends upon all\nthis information but the center for\nanything is data and based on the data\nwhat is the analysis and from the\nanalysis what are the decisions we are\ngoing to provide to the employees so for\nthis uh intelligent framework is one\nconcept which is having the three\ncomponent intelligent digital platform\nand intelligence Technologies so this is\nvery important to understand mean this\nis which is having all this information\nso what are the intelligence um\ninformation we are having what are the\ndigital platform or the uh environments\nwe are going to provide in and what are\nthe intelligence Technologies which are\nhere there to provide the\nsuggestions now uh in terms of sap\nAntics Cloud uh automating the discovery\nof the insights and giving us an\nopportunity to sap uh leverage data\nscience so data science is one thing so\nsap antic cloud is a complete tool which\nwill have all the information so we can\nhave discover analyze plan and predict\nin one user experience then it can from\ndata to in intelligence it can take data\nmake some um analysis and can provide\nsome end to end decisions as well to the\nbusiness users and for all decision\ntypes so it it depends it for all the\ndecision types mean it may be strategic\nor maybe operational or tactical\ndecisions uh so this is a confident tool\nmeans uh another feature is a confident\nmeans it can provide conversational\nmeans in natural Lang English language\nuh users can ask questions and they can\nget the data analysis easily in a\neffective way and it is automated me it\nis a very automated detect drivers for\nkpi and it is predictive so in\npredictive it can predict potential\noutcomes and forecast with the push of a\nbutton means it just a simple click and\nwe can get the next 6 months or five\nyears prediction as well that is uh that\nis why it is confident\ntool contextual means it contains all\nthe information based on the data it can\nprepare various charts various\ndashboards or board rooms and can plan\num the data and can provide some\ninsights which will provide uh means\nactions to the employees or the business\nusers and then it have the data literacy\nas well which will increase the data\nliteracy engagement and accountability\nwith the common business language and uh\nonce we have this all insight to action\nand data it can be intelligence Network\nso whatever the data intelligence\ncollected from different different um\nareas of the word or business\napplication that can be combined in the\ncloud and that that should be possible\nwith this um sap antic Cloud so as this\nis a data to intelligence framework we\ncan see means once we have this business\nintelligence then interise planning and\nthen augmented analytics so this is one\nthing augmented analytics is very\npowerful where it it provides some uh\nsmart Discovery search to Insight smart\npredict are the powerful features which\nare provided under augmented analytics\nthe center is data and from the data\nwhat is the intelligence we are getting\nso this is the main uh Concepts we\nshould be aware about this uh sap Antics\nCloud why it is there and what is the um\npurpose of it so that's it from this\nvideo I hope you have understood the\nmain basic concepts of the SCP Antics\ncloud in this video I'm going going to\ntell you about how to get started with\nthe sap Antics Cloud so that you can do\nsome Hands-On uh practice on the SCP\nAntics Cloud so to do this just go to\nGoogle uh.com and you can just search\nfor SCP Antics cloud and the first very\nfirst page which is comes about sap\nAntics uh. Cloud if you when you click\non this uh you can see uh uh a website\nwhich gets open uh which says about all\nthe information about the antic cloud\nand it does have the start your uh free\n30-day trial version um for getting\naccess or if you wanted to uh get a\nlicense version as well so to get\nstarted means we can get started with\nthe initially on 30-day trial uh so to\ndo this just click on this once you\nclick on this uh you will get a page\nopen where it will ask you um your email\nID so you just need to mention the\nbusiness email ID uh for for getting\nthis get free trial once you provide\nyour email ID you just need to check\nthis uh and then get the free trial once\nyou click on this you will get an um\nemail of the confirmation about the scpx\ncloud and once we activate that account\nfrom the email uh sap andx Cloud gets uh\nwe get the user ID and the password so\nonce we have this so it just uh\nspecifies uh uh that trial um so so this\nis one Tri trial user which I have got\nand similar way which is there uh so\nwhere I\nhave got this um activated for 30 days\nnow uh when we log to this uh you can\nsee means this is the home screen of\nthis application and we can do our\npractice on the initial basis on this so\nyou have this option of uh this home uh\nthen there are some profiles settings\navailable here but the important part is\nhere means what is what are the\ndifferent things which we can do so\ncreating story antic applications so all\nthese things we will see in detail in\nthe next coming videos but these are\nsome of the options which are available\nhere and um by doing this uh so there\nare some options disabled as well\nbecause we have the trial version we\ndon't have some access as well for some\nof the features like security then some\ndeployment and some other uh things as\nwell so this is uh this is the things uh\nthis it will come like uh some sample\nstory as well you can see uh this is\nsomething which is there already\nand so there is one sample for dashboard\nthey have provided with this to\nunderstand this if you click on brow\nbrowse files uh we get an option to see\nhere and in the samples folder there is\none option uh one application which is\nsample revenue and analysis so this is\nvery uh detailed uh analysis application\nor dashboard which is provided here\nwhich gives all the information here so\nyou can see uh various charts has been\ncreated uh there are some um gross\nmargin percentage is given here um then\ndate range filter as well here it is\ngiven like this so uh all this is uh you\ncan see different different charts\navailable um product by State uh then uh\nhow each product has been performed over\nthe year so this is also it has been\nprovided uh then there is one um if you\nif you just filter out here uh that it\ngets changed automatically the data so\nthis is also very powerful I think Miss\num if you click on this sales manager\noverview as well this is another thing\nwhere which is provided which sales\nmanagers are top five which are bottom\nfive um and how much revenue they have\nso all this kind of analysis it has\nprovided and it is very helpful uh so\nthis is another tab which provides some\ninformation in some different charts as\nwell so this is uh very good to uh see\nuh like uh ge maps and all those things\nso if you can see this is very powerful\nin terms of um analysis applications we\nare going to build and uh all we are\ngoing to learn this how how to build\nthese geom Maps then these types of\ncharts and all those things based on our\ndata we will see this in detail in\ncoming videos uh how to build all these\nanalysis applications um but this is an\noverview of this Tool uh there are some\noptions available here mean uh which\nwhich are there so once this trial uh\nbasically this trial is just for 30 days\nand they also allows us to extend it to\nanother 60 days so in total we can get 0\ndays of trial as well and if you wanted\nto buy then you can click on this buy\nnow option and um it has provided this\ninformation which which is for business\nit's for do 22 per uh user per month so\nit depends upon uh how much uh users how\nmany users you wanted to have and all\nthose things\nso uh when we have we buy the license\nversion it gives on premises data source\nconnections as well in trial version\nwill not get that uh feasibility or\nflexibility to connect to different data\nsources but this is how it is uh so we\ncan buy this as well um so we will see\nU many things on this uh Tools in coming\nvideos so I hope uh you have got an idea\nhow to get started with this Cloud uh\ntool in this video I am going to take\ncore functionalities of sap Antics Cloud\nlet's see one by one what are are the\ndifferent core functionalities of sap\nAntics Cloud before understanding uh\nfunctionalities of the cloud antic Cloud\nlet's learn about the intelligence area\nera so as you know means initially it is\nit was Industrial Automation then it was\na business process automation era and\nthen digital transformation so all this\nwere digital era and then now it is\nintelligence era so in intelligence era\nwe need to understand means what is\nintelligence era and uh what are the\nwhat is expected uh from intelligence\nera the first point is do more with less\nthat means we should be more proactive\nthan reactive means by looking at the\ncurrent or the historical data we should\nbe able to predict the next uh so that\nwe need to see uh deliver Basin class\nexperiences in the computation era\nThrive for excellence that is what we\nshould be able to uh see invention of\nnew business model uh we should be able\nto proactively search for new business\nopportunities because the uh the pace of\nthe changing um business is important\nand we need to understand that and we\nshould be able to take uh proper\ndecisions to search for the new business\nopportunities embedded intelligence is\none thing where providing intelligence\nat the core of the business driving\nday-to-day day decision making so this\nis important uh to understand all these\naspects what is intelligence era\nso what is in sap antic Cloud so there\nare two things one is embedded\nintelligence and open Innovation so\nembedded intelligence allows Frontline\nemployees to make better day-to-day\ndecisions relevant to the application\nthey interact uh which can identify\ncritical sales factor identify risk flag\nemployees who are risk of leaving the\nbusiness so this is also important to\nunderstand means the risk of the\nemployees uh who are going to stay in\nthe organization and who are going to to\nlive so that is also we need to\nunderstand open Innovation allows\norganization uh to evaluate internal and\nexternal data to predict business\noutcomes uh optimizing day-to-day\nimportant however intelligence can\ninfluence the unknown so this is also\nimportant now the main feature or the\nmain capability of the analytics cloud\nis smart analytics our augmented cap\ncapabilities so there are two things\nsearch to Insight and smart insight\nso search to insights Works based on the\nvisualization uh it's not just\nvisualization but use a natural language\nto query the data users can just type\nsome languages um some uh queries in the\nEnglish language and the tool can\ngenerate the uh quickly can generate\nvarious types of reports in in graphical\nand in tabular formats as well so it is\nnot always visualization only smart\ninser is explain any data point measure\nor Dimension to further add the trend\nand pattern Discovery process so we will\nboth we will see this practically how\nthis is uh to be\nimplemented smart features is also\nanother options available where built-in\nconnectors to different different data\nsources available intelligent algorithms\nhighlighting possible data quality\nissues and distributing the data so this\nis also uh key one smart transformation\nwhich allows to quickly address and\nsolve data quality issues uh we have the\ngrowing library of business contents\nacross 15 plus Industries and 27 plus\nlines of business any type of business\nif you have you can come to this uh\nCloud uh tool analytics cloud and uh we\ncan uh integrate that business uh to\nbuild powerful visualizations and story\nbols so faster way to find answers uh we\ncan just type questions and instantly\ngenerate meaningful visualization we can\nrecognize important Trends with a click\nof button and visualization within\ncontext explanation uh there is machine\nlearning technology also used where we\ncan take accurate decisions and\npredictive model is also powerful\nfeature which works in the background to\nidentify key drivers or factors that\ninfluence the\nbusiness so predictive forecasting uh\nwhich forecast future performance with\nthe single click we can automatically\nupdate projections as new data comes uh\nbecomes available and data detect the\nrisk and not to miss the targets\nin summary sap antis cloud is very\npowerful tool which has initiative smart\nfeatures uh with Advanced machine\nlearning Technologies uh it is\naccessible to everyone so anyone can\naccess it at any time on any\ndevices uh one simple Cloud which is\nintegrated behind planning Insurance\ninsights are acted upon is simple and\neasy so uh these all the our um core\ncapabilities of the sap Antics Cloud\nlet's learn some of the concepts about\nthe cloud uh what are the different\ntypes of cloud and in this video I'm\ngoing to tell tell you about the cloud\non premise and hybrid uh clouds which\nare important to understand means in\nterms of understanding sap Antics Cloud\nso what sap Antics offers so sap Antics\nCL Cloud can offer on premise\napplication so on premise application or\non premise Cloud that means it is hosted\nby customer or the client all the set\nall the user rights and access rights\nare maintained by the customer so it\njust um we just need to give our sap\nAntics Cloud uh to the customer uh so it\nis hosted by the customer there is\ncloud-based application uh it is hosted\nby provider suppose provides the sap\nCloud then it is hosted by sap and then\nit maintains all the user rights user\nroles and granting access to different\ndifferent users so all this based on the\ncloud-based application the third system\nis hybrid it can be possible some of the\nuh things maintain in the on premise and\nsome of the things maintain at the cloud\nBase by the provider\nso it can be possible we can connect to\nboth cloud and on premises uh tool so\nall these three are different different\ntypes of the sap Antics uh Cloud\nactually but in sap Antics Cloud um Can\ncan give any of the service uh for for\nthe customers\nuh to understand more in about sap\nAntics architecture so this is something\nwhich is gives some more information\nabout the sap Antics Cloud architecture\nso you can see uh we do have some\napplications then Antics capabilities\ncore capabilities and P platform our\nservice so sap Cloud platform is sap\nSap's Cloud which\nis hosted by and it is provided to the\ncustomer so what are the core\ncapabilities of analytics Cloud you can\nsee uh it is it provides data connec\nconnectivity data wrangling data\nmodeling Administration auditing\nvisualization collaboration mobile and\nAPI so all these are the core\ncapabilities of the sap Antics Cloud uh\nthen we can see analytic capabilities\nonce uh we build some um database\nconnectivity or preparing data wrangling\ndata modeling then it comes about the\nantic capability so where sap antic\ncloud is uh useful where it is bi\nplanning predictive and application\ndesign so in in bi it can be possible to\nhave uh Discovery and then charts and\ntables goo maps all this kind of\nvisualization in planning we can have\nevents and workflow allocation and value\nDev driver tree simulation uh in\npredictive we have Smart assist build\nand deploy predictive models and in\napplication design we have scripting\ncomponents uh UI themes and style sheet\nwhich is for application design based on\nthe SD case and uh the lastly the app\nare sap digital boardroom sap Antics Hub\nand mobile experience so these are the\ndifferent different things we can do SAP\ndigital boardroom we will see\npractically as well sap analytics Hub as\nwell we see means what is the use of It\nMobile experience how we can we can see\nhow we can build the mobile uh the\napplications which can be displayed over\nthe mobile devices as well so that we\nwill see and um the sap Cloud platform\ncan connect to the Amazon web services\ncloud data sources and it applications\nuh sap Data Center well uh like it's on\npremise data sources and applications so\nthis is overall architecture of the sap\nAntics cloud in this video we will see\npreparation sharing and collaboration\nthe basic concepts and overview of this\nfunctionality which sap Antics Cloud\nprovides the first thing is about\nunderstanding the basic Cloud Concepts\nwhich says data visualizations and share\nwhen we say data we need to acquire the\ndata using connections to different\ndifferent different data providers so\nthere are so many data providers which\nwe will see later uh to which we sap an\nCloud can connect and acquire the data\nand then this data once acquired we can\ncreate different different story board\nand\nvisualizations or the charts uh geom\nmaps and all kinds of visualization uh\nwe can explore this visualization so\nthat is visualization and the lastly is\na share or collaborate so once we have\ncreated the different uh story boards or\nthe analysis applications we can uh\nshare with the other users uh different\nuh business stakeholders who can uh make\nuse of it so that that is the third step\nfor\nthis so what is the data acquisition and\nwhat are the different data providers we\ncan connect to uh acquire the data so\nhere you can see right from sapana bbpc\nErp we can connect to the bo Universe\nAnd Then There are some other apart from\ns sap data providers which are SQL IBM P\ndata we can con connect to the MS SQL\nServer MySQL Oracle and open Edge as\nwell we can also use o data services um\nwe can use Excel as well XLS or CSV\nfiles as well and uh to the cloud\nconnections as well we can connect like\nsuccess factors field guards conquer and\nGoogle drive as well we can connect to\nacquire some data as you can see um\nthese are the live connections what are\nthe sap connections we have like here\nHana bw2 sap Bo universes they are live\nconnection that means it is directly\nconnected to those data providers\nhowever we don't need uh to acquire the\ndata directly so it is just a\nreplication happening at the uh data\nprovider\nend so the second step is a data\npreparation so once we have acquired the\ndata by connecting to different\ndifferent data uh sources\nthen we need to prepare the data so to\nprepare the data means we need to create\nmodels we can create models which can be\nused to prepare the data we can create\nthe hierarchies which is parent child\nlevel can be inserted uh because it is\nrequired as per business as well to have\nsome hierarchical report reports or\nvisualization to be created uh we can\ncreate some custom formulas as well\nwhich can be used to modify the data we\ncan combine data find and linking me\njoin of the different different types of\ndata in a single um model we can use\ngrouping functionality as well um that\nwe will\nsee and then uh last step is\ncollaboration uh once we have created\ndifferent visualization or the dashboard\nor the story board or the digital\nboardroom we can share that with the\ndifferent uh business stakeholders we\ncan have a discussion with them and then\nwe can ask some questions to them we can\nask them feedback about the\nvisualizations or the data so that we\ncan take proper decisions to improve our\nvisualization we can assign some tasks\nto them which which is useful for them\nto complete it uh so that it will be\nbeneficial for as a developer as well\nfor us and the sharing stories we can\nshare the stories internally and\nexternally internally means within the\norganization or to externally to other\norganization or other business users as\nwell let's learn practically about\nmodels in the sap antic clouds the\ntheoretical section I have already\ncovered what is models so model is a\nbasis for all the\nanalytical visualizations we are going\nto create so the very first uh step to\nto our analytics or visualizations is\ncreating models model is a\nrepresentation of the data business data\nof an organization which is high level\ndesign for the anti requirements of an\nuser so that is what model is and there\nare two types of the models which is one\nis planning model and the other one is\nanalytical models so in planning model\nuh it is preconfigured with the time and\ncategories uh with the actual budget\nforecast and rolling forecast values the\nother model is analytical model which is\na very simple general purpose bi related\nmodels which consist of um dimensions\nand measures uh that we will see\nhere basically to understand models\nfirst we need to understand the\ndimensions and measures what is\ndimensions and what is measures so\nbasically when we say measures so\nmeasures comes like in the format of the\naggregated values like sales revenue\nquantity sold or cost kind of things are\nmeasures while dimensions are like kind\nof this which is state city product and\ntime so these are something which is\nDimensions which represents the data uh\nwhich is so it will all always have one\nto many relationship mean state will may\nhave many record in the sales table so\nit is a transactional data so um you can\nsee from this diagram that it's state\ncity product and time is Dimensions uh\ndimensions and it it all has one to many\nrelationships so this is the basic\nconcepts of the dimensions let's see one\nby one uh how we can uh create models in\nthis uh let's create a model from here\nuh you will see an option of on home\nscreen you will have a create model\noption so let's create uh model so when\nwe say create model we can either import\nfrom our computer with some uh files or\nwe can get data from data source so\nbasically when we click on this data\nsource you will see the how to acquire\ndata by connecting to different\ndifferent uh data providers so it does\nhave all um types of data providers\nprovided here which is a live data we\nyou can say cloud for customer Cloud for\ncustomer and Conquer field glass Hanam\nsuccess Vector data sets Google big\ndrive so there are so many data types\nthere are some uh disabled as well\nbecause it is a trial version it is not\nuh POS mean uh available here but there\nare some other as well uh there are some\ndata source type as well so cloud or on\npremises we already saw what is cloud\nand what is on premise uh data data\ntypes so that we will see here you can\nconnect there are cloud storage CRM data\nwarehouse and there are different\ndifferent um categories defined and you\ncan see Google as well so Google Drive\nwe can connect to Google Drive there are\nsap open connectors so it depends upon\nwhen we say cloud then it will just show\nCloud databases these are the cloud\ndatabases when we say on premises then\nin on premises it will just have these\noptions which is like this and this for\nnow to create a model we can just import\nfile from our computer uh which is XLS\nfile for now let's do that when we click\non that let's it select source file from\nhere and I have one file which is\navailable there which is sales data you\ncan see use first row as column headers\nso suppose we have first row generally\nin model uh we have the first row as a\ncolumn headers so that is what it is so\nwe can say uh we can select this option\nso that it will it will select as a\ncolumn\naddress and let's create on click on\nimport once we click on import it will\ntake some time to get it\nloaded so now we have this model is\nimported means basically the data is\nimported in and we have models so you\ncan see means the tool will\nautomatically select the data types and\nall those things so you can see uh this\nis um when we click on this columns so\nuh what are the Excel headers are there\nso this is an Excel file which is\nuh I have imported as to create a model\nso the uh first row is um column header\nso which will be taken as column headers\nhere so you can see it\nhere the similar way so you can see on\nthe right side there are different\ndifferent uh so when we say uh models so\nwhen when the model is created it it\nshows model quality and then data\nquality calculation issues so if there\nare any issues then it will show issues\nif there are no issues then no issues\ndetected it show shows 36 rows 14\ncolumns seven dimensions 7 seven measur\nso it automatically identified which are\nthe dimensions and which are the\nmeasures uh the data which is this XLS\nfile then there are some other fields\nwhich is default currency for model\nwhich will uh uh is defined for this uh\np\nnow suppose this is a date column and it\nhas selected a generic Type U basically\nit is um not uh generic Dimension mean\nit is not so it is it is a date type so\nwe we can change this data type here so\nand we can select date once we select\nthis as a\ndate then it will uh automatically take\nits data date format so it will select y\ny y so year and month is the format so\nif that generally it will select\nautomatically if it is not selected\nautomatically then we can um choose by\nour own means what are the different\ndifferent or we can make it a different\nformat as well if you want so uh this is\ndata quality issues no data quality\nissues detected and so data distribution\nso you can see mean what is uh for each\nwhat how many count and all those things\nso so once we have the is uh created uh\nnow um you can see these are the generic\nDimensions it's just a state stra city\nstore um is generic Dimension so you can\nsee there is uh all information so what\nis California how many count of Records\nso 12 NE 12 like this so it will show up\nhere there are two options of U two\ncolumns also in the model which is\nlatitude and longitude so this is also\nwe need to have when we create create a\ngo map so this is important to\nunderstand me how um this columns can be\nuh used for creating Geo Maps so when we\nonce we have this we can create some\nlocations so this is latitude and\nlongitude so we can select go enrichment\noption here and by uh coordinates\nbecause this is a latitude and longitude\nuh the coordinate so we can select this\nand we can create another location\ndescription so we can just click on this\ncoordinates we can give some name so\nthis is location um so it has maximum\nlength so we can say\num so location coordination uh so these\nare the options available it had\nautomatically taken uh latitude is a\ncolumn which is available in this uh\nmodel so latitude will Define this\nlatitude column values longitude will\nlongitude will take and this is\nsomething which is location ID we can\nselect here here we can select the state\nand location description which is which\nshould be unique so basically a store\nhere is having unique values\nso so this is something which is we can\nselect so that it will be uh creating\nthat location so just create um click on\nthis now once we click on this it it\nwill create another column with the\nlocation um coordinations so you can see\nuh the another column which is got\ncreated\nso here you can see uh these are some of\nthe state and this its coordinates which\nis created and now we can create uh uh\nwe can use this column to create our um\ngeom map so that we will see how to\ncreate it as well so this is one thing\nwe can do it the other points is about\nthe measures so when we select the\nmeasur columns as well you can see it is\nautomatically uh created uh so it it it\nautomatically identify this is a measure\nthen it's a number format what is the\nnumber format if you want we can change\nuh this number\nformat uh there is scaling also we can\nspecify here uh decimal places if you\njust wanted to keep uh two decimals then\nalso you can keep it as two\ndecimal so now once we have this all\nDimensions which are these four\ndimensions are there you can see how to\ndifferentiate this measures and\ndimension\nuh so like you can see this icon which\nis um this like Star icon like this\nwhich is dimensions and measures will\nhave different um icon here so that it\nwill be easy to understand me which are\nthis and you can see location as well it\nis identified as a different\nicon date is also like calendar icon it\nis there so this is very um useful to\nidentify Dimensions measures and uh date\ncolumns now uh once we have this um mean\nunnecessary column mean suppose latitude\nand longitude we have created another\ncolumn column which is for location\ncoordinates we can delete out this means\nit is not required to uh select this\ncolumn and uh then you\ncan select um delete column from here so\nthis is not required so um we can delete\nout this\nthis as well so basically when we say\nbecause that is unnecessary and we don't\nwant to show that to the end users as\nwell as when they create\nso just to avoid some confusions while\ncreating visualization so this is\nlocation coordinates column which is uh\nused here now uh all these things are\ndone means you can see um uh there are\noptions\none more thing which which is adding a\nparent child hierarchies as well you can\nsee there are two like this is category\nand uh product so uh we can um enable\nparent child hierarchies as well which\nis required when we uh drill through the\nanalysis of the data for this creating\num parent child hierarchies we can uh\njust click on this column suppose parent\nproduct is um child and categories a\nparent so how we can Define the parent\nchild hierarchies so just click on this\ncolumn and add Dimension attributes when\nyou click on this we can have option of\nparent child\nhierarchies this is the one uh we can\nselect and we can select which column is\na parent so we have for categories we\nhave product as\na uh category as a app parent so this\nthis this option we can select now you\ncan see this category has become a\nparent child and if you click on this\ncategory option you can see parent child\nhierarchy and parent of a product\nDimension so this is option um we can um\nsee so by using this hierarchical column\nlike this you can see this Icon by using\nthis hierarchical columns we can create\nour visualization um like drill down on\ndifferent different uh\ncolumns so this is what the basic thing\nwe can do uh there are different options\nthat we will see in detail as well me\nlike creating a transform and all those\nthings uh there are many things which we\ncan do with these models while we create\nso we will see that as well for now\nwe'll just create a model on this just\ncreate uh create model once you click it\nit will ask have you finished mapping\nand editing your data so we can just\nclick on Create and uh now we can give\nsome data is let's say this is an opt uh\nso we can select folders as well here\nmeans if you want and just click on okay\nit will take some time to uh generate\nthe model depending upon the size of the\ndata it takes time so once now we can\nsee model or sales model is created\nsuccessfully we got a message saying\nthat this is created now you can see\nthis is the file which is got created uh\nimported and we can see now um there are\nfew important aspects of this model to\nunderstand is like when we click on this\nmodel you will see account is\none dimension attributes so we can\nsay then date is like time all are\ngeneric one so if you click on this\naccount you will see all the dimens all\nthe fact um fact or measure values like\ndiscount gross margin sales revenue will\ncome under this account so this is\nimportant to understand means all\nmeasor values will fall under\naccount Dimension and then date so date\nis another thing where we can\nspecify its type and it's glity so\nbasically from the this GL is it is\nautomatically decided by its month\nbecause our column is like year and\nmonth value so it says month suppose if\nyou have date uh daily data then it it\nit may decide this granularity as dat\ndate or day so this is by default due to\nbased on the data and default hierarchy\nis year quarter month so this is uh we\ncan specify means what is hierarchy so\nthis is basically we have select it\nautomatically selected but we can change\nthat as well there are some settings\navailable here which is when we click on\nthese settings you can see so general\nsettings you can see this is model type\nis analytical we can see analytical type\nmodel layout account and then sales\nmodel we can change this name as well\nhere then uh data security as well user\nprivileges to whom it can be accessible\nand all those things data audit data\nlocking uh so we can enable that if you\nhave a permission to do\nit so data access controll Dimensions so\nwe can if you want Miss we can uh select\nthis so these are the different options\nwhich are available fiscal time is\nsuppose we wanted to um give the\nfinancial year um so when it t like some\nsome countries have the financial or\nfiscal year of April to March next year\nso that you can specify here is where\nwhen it can start planning and time\nrange this is for planning uh models\ncurrency so default currency is USD if\nyou want we can change it uh to\ndifferent as well uh so currency\nconversion also we will see in detail\nhow to do this currency conversion so we\nneed to select this option data and\nperformance so so whether optimize story\nbuilding performance so these are the\noptions which are available\nhere so this is about the DAT D\nDimensions date attributes then all is\ngeneric which is here so if you select\nthis as well you can see um what are\nthese values and what are the different\nif it is hierarchies enabled or not so\nwe can if you want means we can create\nhierarchies from here as well so these\nare the three important Dimension which\nare available one is account uh then\ndate and generic so these these three\ndimensions we should be able to\nunderstand means when when the models\nare\ncreated you can uh you can see uh when\nwe this is another list View and this is\na uh grid view you can say where it will\njust list out all the dimensions uh one\nby one there are other options uh we can\njust select like this edit add new\ndimension we can add from new from here\nas\nwell so this is what we can um see uh\nnow once we have this um model created\nwe can uh browse this models as well\nmeans we can go to files and where we\ncan see our model which is created here\nhere you can see sales model so when we\nclick on this it will uh um we open like\nthe similar way uh this that's it from\nthis video we will see PR practically\nhow to create stories from this model\nlet's learn practically about viewing\nthe data from the model in the last\nvideo we have created one um model based\non one of the Excel sheet um and based\non that we have uh created different\ndifferent uh topics which we have seen\nin the last video so let's try to\nconnect to that uh model and try to see\nthe data which is uh we have uh created\nso to do this go to U menu option here\nwhere we can just create uh a\nstory uh just select this option uh so\nonce you uh select this option you will\nget an various options to choose\ndifferent different templates to create\nsome stories or we can just access and\nexplore data so for now we will just see\nhow to access uh and explore data there\nare different options available here as\nwell uh we can just directly select our\nfile or any Excel file or anything or we\ncan connect to different different data\nsources like um Live Connections or\ninput connections and then data acquired\nfrom an existing model so we do have\nalready an existing model which is uh\ncreated so we will select that once we\nselect this and then just select that\noption uh means where we can see um\nvarious options available so now when uh\nit comes by default it has two tabs here\nwhich is one is story and one is data so\nnow um when we say we don't have\nanything here uh\nso we uh by default it is our suggested\nis a numeric point chart which is here\nuh we can select different different\ncharts as well from here other tables\nbut before that we can we need to select\nuh the measures so suppose we wanted to\nsee the measures value just select uh\nthis quantity sold then it's it will\ncome so if you want another just select\nthe another me uh measures as well so\nthat it will show up here this is the\nthing which is there um now what we can\ndo this is just a measures but if you\nwanted to add some Dimensions as well\nthen just select on this uh once we\nclick on this we can just say select all\nso that it will come up all these things\nso now uh this is the uh options and if\nyou just wanted to filter out suppose\nfor one city we wanted to see the sales\nrevenue or quantity uh or something just\nselect that particular then we can get\nso this is one filter which is applied\nhere you can say what is this so means\nwe can remove this filter again means\nfrom here and uh there is one more\noption to remove this filter is from\nhere as well like so you will see clear\nselection option here available so these\nare the different different options\navailable uh which is here now suppose\nwe wanted to see the T data in the\ntabular format we can go to here we can\nselect this option as a\ntable now uh so when we select table\nformat it will show what is this a\nquantity sold and sales Reven in tabular\nformat now suppose I wanted to add a\ncity column just click on this city\ncolumn now it will come up like this I\nwanted to have a data as well so just\nselect this data as well so you will see\nuh for various dates it is a kind of a\ndrill or hierarchical data for each of\nthe date it will show automatically so\nno need to do anything uh customize or\ndevelopment uh so for this particular\nmanager or just select the manager so\nthis is something I\njust so if you just wanted to add\nmanager here do add\nmanagers or some other columns as well\nso this way we can uh see all the\ncolumns data in particular way and\nwherever the hierarchies so remember in\nlast video we have created hierarchies\nfor product and categories so you can\nsee for others this product there is\nsome category for which we which is\nappearing here now now we can see uh uh\nthis is this is how it is now we can\nchange some uh this to chart as well uh\nso let's let's select a line chart maybe\nuh so this is the way it can be possible\nto uh display it and suppose we wanted\nto do some formatting on the charts we\ncan go to the designer mode and from\nhere we can select suppose if we don't\nwant to have uh um Dimensions uh we can\nremove it from here like and then uh\nsuppose the color panel we can choose\nfrom here as well we can change the\ncolor\npanels uh so these are some of the\nmeasures which are there let's see some\nother uh charts as well\nhere say this is a bar column so this is\njust a simple chart and um you can see\nthis is a uh like in in this uh vertical\nformat if you wanted to in horizontal as\nwell you can uh do it uh so these are\nthe some of the things which are\navailable there\nthen suppose you don't want to see sales\nrevenue column or just quanti so just\nclick on this so it will automatically\nremove it mean it just it will just show\nsales revenue we will see all these\ndetails one by one for each and um every\nchart later and separate videos\nbut this is what how we want we can see\nthe data but there is other things which\nare there so if you click on this story\nstories also just we can create\ndifferent different tables or charts\nhere uh based on our requirement uh so\nyou can see me here insert chart suppose\nI just wanted to insert some chart here\nand um so uh it will automatically take\nthat sales model and then it will charge\nstructure horizontal or vertical so\nlet's say vertical\nif you wanted to add some measures let's\nadd some measures so let's say gross\nmagin and sales revenue we wanted to\ndisplay so this is how it is we wanted\nto add some Dimensions let's add\nDimensions so City and for manages in\neach City so these are the some things\nwhich we can do uh there are some other\nthings which is about the colors and all\nthose things which we can uh change from\nhere you can see different different\ncolors so suppose this is something\nwhich is you wanted to change\num\nso this these are some of the formatting\nthere are various or many features\navailable so this is what it is uh we\ncan add directly a table as well\nhere so in table as well uh we can add\num different different fields like uh in\nthe designer if you go we can add a\nmeasures and dimensions which is like\nthis we can add some filters as well so\nthis is how it is uh we can do various\ntypes of um data to be shown on the\nstorage so we will see one by one how to\nbuild stories and what are the different\ndifferent templates we can select and\nwhat are the different ways to design\nthe same so this is this is how I wanted\nto show you um now if you click on this\nview then it will show up me how this\nwill look like so this is how it is so\nthat's what I wanted to show in this\nvideo where how we can connect to our\nmodels and how we can view our data\nwhich is we have created let's learn\nabout Connections and data models in sap\nAntics\nCloud so what are the different\nconnection types there are two\nconnection types available live uh as\nlive data and import data as the name\nsuggest live data will be connected to\nuh sap data sources on real time while\nimport data will we need to import the\ndata from the database provider or\ndatabase connections and then use uh to\ncreate different models in the uh sap\nantic Cloud so we'll see what is the\ndifference between uh sap uh live data\nconnections and UT data connections so\nlive data connections available on cloud\nand on PR ises uh similar uh input data\nconnections is also available for cloud\nand on premises data sources uh live\ndata connections does not replicate the\ndata in sap Antics cloud while uh we\nneed to replicate the data within the\nsap Antics Cloud so whatever um data\nrefresh or data replication happens it\nhappens at the database site in live\ndata connections while uh in input\nconnections it does not happen and we\nneed to replicate thata in sap and\nCloud uh we can uh use SCP exist uh use\nexisting uh data models for analysis\nwhen we use live data connection so\nsuppose we are connecting to sap Han\nView and all maybees as well so that we\ncan use those directly for our analysis\nwhile in input data connections we need\nto acquire the data from the database uh\nproviders or data databases and then we\nneed to create a different models by\nusing the sap antic cloud modeler\nwe can in real live data connections\nupdate your data visualization and\nstorage with the new data in real time\nso as live data connections as it name\nsuggest it's live so it all happens on\nreal time while uh we need to refresh\nand import data connection all our\nvisualization and stories when uh we\nupdate the\napplications so this is our data\nconnections environment um diagram which\nsays what what is input data connection\nand how live data connections on the\nleft side of this diagram you can see uh\ninput data connections uh how it is it\nhas Cloud applications and this antic\nCloud will connect to the local files or\nand it can then connect to the file\nserver then file server can use sap\nantic Cloud agent and platform detector\nuh connectors uh to connect to that\nparticular databases and then it can be\nused and consumed or acquired by the\nAntics cloud and then it can be used so\ndifferent data providers which are\nconquer Salesforce field gases Global\ndriver the cloud applications or Cloud\nconnections uh which can be used uh\nincluding success Vector o data hybrid\ncloud while the live data connections we\ncan connect directly to sap Han BW sapes\num bpc um like HCC uh kind of um data\nproviders and it happens data directly\nit uses uh um Co is cross origin uh\nconnectors uh and direct connection data\nsources so let's see what is uh this and\nwhich connections to we use uh so it all\ndepends upon the environment uh based on\nthe requirement for establishing live\nand import data connections we can use\nuh but sap recommends to creating live\ndata connections us using direct\nconnection uh type um like cross origin\nresource sharing so this is one uh\nconnection uh connection type so if you\nsee what is C RS or cross origin\nresource sharing so this is a mechanism\nthat uses additional sttp headers uh to\ntell a browser to let web appliation\nrunning at one origin and it has\npermission to access selected resources\nfrom a server at a different origin so\nit can be possible mean suppose one um\napplication or web application is\nrunning at one domain or one origin it\nhave the access to uh to other domain or\nother origin or so that is CS mechanism\nand that can be possible that is called\na cross origin HTTP request which access\ndifferent resources when uh it has uh\nbased in a different different origin\nmaybe it is domain protocol or\nPort\nso that's what sap recommends about\nconnecting they said it's better to use\nlive data\nconnections because that is more\nflexible uh when we create\nvisualization in this video we will see\ndata preparation basic modeling how\nbasic modeling can be performed and what\nis the basic uh Concepts about the\nmodeling so what is data modeling data\nmodeling model or data modeling is a\nbase for all SSC activities so what are\nthe things it starts with the data\nmodel it describes the ways the data\nwill be analyzed provides structure and\ndifferent functions like calculation or\nsecurity and Sap's machine learning\ntechnology helps automatically clean\nyour data by alerting of possible errors\nand categorizing measures and\ndimensions modeling tools helps to\nenance the data for geo analysis and\nmulti-level hierarchies to gain deeper\ninsights basic understanding of the data\nmodeling is the is very important if you\nunderstand models or the data models it\nis going to be very easy to build your\nvisualizations and uh uh stories and uh\nother um analysis\napplications how to cre uh create uh me\nmodel so uh from the menu you will have\nan option of to create a model uh we\nwill be seeing this practically as well\nso how to create a model so this is the\noption to create a model and then we can\nget uh an option to connect to the data\nsources and uh get the acquire the files\nof the database files sap analytics\nCloud bi offers two main components one\nis models and the second one is storage\nso model is the first step we can say uh\nwhich provides various functionalities\nlike data wrangling or cleaning data\nsets defining measures and dimensions\nestablishing hierarchies setting units\ncurrencies and adding formulas once we\nhave that then there are two uh\nimportant types of models is analytics\nmodel and planning model so in this case\nis uh so Antics model is based on\nwhatever the models we are retriving or\nwe are acquiring the data and planning\nmodel is something related to the plan\nplanning functionality which is provided\nby the sap and based on these models we\nbuild storage uh to visualize the\nprepared data coming from a model so\nthat is what stories are we will see\npractically how to create stories as\nwell basic modeling uh we need to start\nwith the data integration strategy where\nwe will start start with the empty model\nthen upload an Excel or CSC file uh or\nlive data connections uh or data input\nor maybe we can connect to the cloud\ndatabase as well so that is what we can\ndo with the as initial step for basic\nmodeling then common isage of for model\nmodeler will be blending data wrangling\nsetting units and currencies uh creating\nhierarchies adding formulas so these\nThese are the various Concepts which are\nrequired in modeling that we will see\npractically what is data modeling um\ndata wrangling blendings and uh creating\nhierarchies as\nwell video we will see how to perform\nbasic data modeling there are various\nconcepts related to the data modeling\nand what is uh what what are they and we\nwill see that in detail first we will\nsee what is the process of the setup and\nconnection preparation modeling data\nsetup is onetime activity uh which is uh\ndone by the administrator which is uh\navailable on the system option which\nsays my abro Administration then\nconnection uh it is end user driven\noperation either acquire data or connect\nremote remotely that is by connecting uh\nlive data or maybe import data so that\ntwo types of connections we can use\nPreparation in preparation operations on\nacquired data once that acquir data data\nis acquired we need to cleanes the dirty\ndata or compile data sets and then\nlastly is the modeling data power users\nto create um common semantic layer for\nall users enable security and planning\ncapability so once the data is acquired\nit is cleaned or transform into a good\nuh data sets uh the modeling data will\nperform uh creating a semantic uh layer\nso first thing where to start from home\nscreen we can get stor is automatically\ncreated when we do one of the following\ndrag and drop a Microsoft Excel file\nsuppose we have a connection um file uh\nany Excel file or CS file we can just\ndrag and drop on the home screen it will\nautomatically connect with the data and\nthen data model is Created from the\nmodel as well we can connect to the all\nsupported uh data sources or data\nproviders and then uh once we have that\nwe can refresh that data or by importing\nfrom a file and from Storage import a\nMicrosoft Excel or CSV file import an\nexisting file or connect to a Google\ndrive or Cloud connector so these are\nthe three options where from where we\ncan get started uh to get or acquire the\ndata into\nSSC so the first step is semantic layer\nwhich is a business representation of a\ncorporate data that helps end users\nAccess Data easily using common business\nterms so model is SS semantic layer\nwhich which has all the components\nlisted below which says dimensions and\nmeasures security defined Dimensions\nwhich are shared series of business rule\nso all these are the required and we\nshould be able to understand what all\nthese components and why it is\nneeded there are uh three types of model\nwe can say planning type model and\nanalytic type model and analytics based\non Han views so planning type model\nwhich is pre pre-configured with the\ndimensions for time and categories uh\nthey offer support for multicurrency and\nsecurity features at the level of both\nmodel and dimension and users with the\nplanning privilege can create their own\nversions of the model data well the\nsecond is antic type model which does\nnot support any time categories or D\ntime categories time and categories but\nrequires a um time Dimension so it\ndoesn't have any categories we will see\nin detail with the example what is time\nand what is categories so that it will\nbe helpful to understand with the\nexample an analytic model based on sap\nHan view so simple model with a single\naccount Dimension but with access to\nother dimension through sapana so\nwhatever the security is getting\ninherited from the Pana these are the\nmodel types which are and based on our\nrequirement or the business requirement\nwe should be using uh one of them then\ndata wrangling is one of the capability\nof the modeling which which manipulate\nthe data to make it accurate and match\nthe business needs it just highlights or\nfocus on our higher value work whatever\nrequire it works on so there are\nfollowing ways to uh do do a data\nwrangling which is split we can split\nthe data in different way suppose we\nhave city city and state name in\ncombination we can separate out state\nand city and separate two columns we can\nconvert to text to number we can\nduplicate columns we can merge columns\nwe can edit single sales we can add\nhighlight for all sales with the same\nvalue When selecting a sale we can\nmaintain a history of transformation\nwith undo and redo features as well so\nwhatever changes happening on the\ntransformations that we can um undo and\nredo we can uh increase user creativity\nuh where user can focus on higher valued\nworkflows through suggestion of most\nobvious actions so we can suggest in for\ndata types transformation suggestion\nbased on individual selection this um so\nthe tool will automatically understand\nme what the user is doing so suppose\nuser has selected some values based on\nthat the tool can suggest uh different\nways to transform that particular\nDimension or measure uh so they can play\nwith the data uh we can show different\nstates previous and future as well\npreview transformation let user decide\non the result data preparation function\nto transform the\ndata responsive experience with the data\nas well so once we create a model we can\nwork from sample and then transform\nreped uh on the entire data set so\nsample serves as a blue print so we can\nrefer the sample provided by sap uh on\nthe sap Antics Cloud platform and that\ncan be used for our reference\nhierarchies in model so this this is\nvery important when we have hierarchies\nlike U level based hierarchies where we\ncan have country state city kind of\nhierarchies that we can Define when when\nwe have organization based on par parent\nchild hierarchies that is also we can\nspecify and um while doing the model we\nneed this uh hierarchies and this is\nsomething which is useful when we wanted\nto drill uh on on the charts from one\nlevel to Next Level that kind of\ndrilling we need uh\nhierarchies in this video we will see\nbasic story design story is a important\npart in sap Antics cloud and we should\nbe able to understand how to create\nstory what are the different different\naspects of the story uh design\nso let's see what is story a story is a\npresentation style document that uses\ncharts visualization text images and\npictograms to describe the data so this\nis one of the sample story we can say uh\nwe'll have a story and the data is for\ndata modeling and this story will be\nhaving different different pages we can\nhave one page can have a GE map the\nother page can have a uh another chart\nor one page can have a j map plus um uh\nthis type of chart as well and another\npage will be having another uh\nstory or maybe a pie chart or maybe a\nbar chart or column chart there are\ndifferent different charts which are\navailable so we can pick it up uh any\nchart and then we can create some\nstories which will describe the\ndata so there are two main views one is\ndata and the story so data is explore\ndata in real time with Dynamic\nvisualization and the stories can design\nbeautiful interactive dashboard for\nusers so measures dimensions and models\nthe three components which are also\nrequired for story so it represent\nmeasures represent the quantities that\nprovide meaning uh to the data example\nsales revenue salary amount cost related\ninformation then Dimensions would be uh\nprovides respective um perspective on\nthe data uh maybe it's string our\ncharacter data which says product ctive\nfirst name last name uh address uh or\nany other um Dimension data then model\nis using dimensions and measures so it\nis combination of the dimensions and\nmeasures we can model the\ndata there are responsive Pages the\npages which are shown here uh page one\nand page two we can create the\nresponsive pages so it can be POS there\nare three types of pages available grid\ncanvas and responsive so in canvas is\nPixel Perfect report for presentation so\nif you wanted to build uh reports for\npresentations kind of um then we can can\ncreate this canvas page responsive page\nis for flexible dashboards that can that\ncan be presented on any device or any\nscreen size maybe laptop um iPhone or\nany other mobile devices or laptop so\nthat is responsive Pages grid page is\njust traditional spreadsheet like Excel\nspreadsheet kind of data which give full\nview of the data so all the data will be\navailable so it's based on the uh need\nsuppose one page maybe a canas page\nother page maybe responsive page the\nthird page may be having all the data in\nthe Excel spreadsheet kind\nof so responsive page so this is U this\nis this is the uh responsive page which\nwe can say and this this is having the\ndevice so it is web and laptop so here\nalso there are some other options of uh\nmobile and we can say uh which for which\nis it for iPhone or different\ndifferent device types as here it can be\nspecified so this is the way we can\nspecify then styling of the page is also\nwe can do there are some this is a chart\nstyling we can specify background color\nactions then border and there are other\nformatting properties as well that we\ncan specify while styling a\npage what are the components we can add\non the story page so charts so there are\ndifferent different charts comparison\nchart Trend chart correlation chart\ndistribution and indicator the other\nother apart from charts are tables so\nvertical table horizontal tables map map\ncontain Z map so that is also we can add\nthen story filter page filter wiet\nfilter also we can add so the filter is\nalso required maybe to filter out the\ndata on the date range maybe or some\nother filters as well that we can give\nprompts also we can give uh thresholds\nuh we can give some threshold value for\nthat particular chart or anything means\nwe can that that is also we can add on\nthe then link Dimensions which is also\navailable here uh then uh next is\nexploring data protected view of the\ndata which can be manipulated to\ngenerate charts of your story pages and\nwe can measures and dimensions are\nselected on per page the visual in the\nlower P updates in real time so this is\nthis is what we will see in\npractically it is a real time update of\nthe data once the top down top filters\nare get changed automatically uh\nthe other charts like below charts will\nbe filter out that we will see\npractically bookmarking is another good\nfeature which is having sap analytics um\nso it is bookmarking we can bookm the\nstory views so big uh create bookmarks\nto save different states of the story\nwhat is the need of the bookmarking so\nwhen a viewing story we may want to come\nback to the same view of the data every\ntime or we may want to set up a\ndifferent states or scenarios so there\nmay be some managers who just wanted to\nsee the sales revenue for particular\nstate every month so he or she can just\nsave that particular state of the story\nand can uh maybe come every month to\njust see that particular State just by\njust clicking or just saving that\nparticular bookmark so that is what it\nis very useful we will see practically\nhow we can do this as well so that it\nwill be helpful to\nunderstand in this video we will learn\nabout creating numeric point chart uh so\nyou can see this is one sample story\nwhich is being created means I will show\nyou means how to create the story and\nthen we will see how to create this\npoint chart uh this kind of point chart\nuh which is helpful uh to highlight us\nthe ma major values or the major uh\naccount values so let's see is how how\nwe can create this kind of uh numeric\npoint chart so let's go to uh in the\ncreate option you will have option of\ncreate\nstory we already have one sales model\ncreated we will just select that let's\nget an access and explore data so let's\nlet's use the sales model which we have\nused uh\nearlier now we can see uh this is what\nwe we have seen practically in last uh\nvideo where we can automatically create\nhere uh the point charts however um uh\nwe can this is what how it can show up\nhere but let's see is how we can build\non our our own numeric point chart so\nwhen we go in the story view uh we have\nthis option of this page one is the\noption where we can uh add different\ndifferent uh we can add the a title here\nfor this page if you want uh let's let's\nadd numeric point chart from this insert\nthere are various options available here\nso let's add insert chart so here uh\nonce you have this uh chart added you\nwill see different options available\nhere or different charts available so\nfor now as we wanted to have a numeric\npoint chart to be added uh\nso let's do that uh so once once we have\nadded it uh we are we need to have uh at\nleast one measure to be added uh so\nlet's add one measure so in this add one\nmeasure we can do a create a calculation\nso we can by default uh add um\nthese measures or at least we can create\na calculation so for now we wanted to\nsee the net revenue as on the numeric\npoint chart so let's create a\ncalculations so you can see there are\ndifferent options available calculated\nmeasures restricted measures difference\nfrom aggregation and dimension to\nmeasures so we will see one by one uh\nfor this and examp with the examples uh\nso in the calculated measure what we\nwanted to we need to create um formula\nso which will be uh let's say original\nprice so once we type it automatically\ncome up me the fields available in the\nmodel and original price minus discount\nis the net sales uh this is the one\nformula which we wanted to check uh we\ncan format it mean just to check any\nsyntax error or something or logical\nerror so if it is valid then we can use\nthis name as um\nsales\nrevenue select this okay so you can see\nthis measures has been added and it will\nbe coming up here so this is one thing\nthere are other things which is uh here\nyou can this is the title uh there are\nother properties available here we can\nsee various add threshold trails and\ncross calculation uh mobile enabled show\nhiide if you wanted to have uh subtitle\nas well we can do it\nso to add subtitle we can uh let's say\nthis is in USD um so if you wanted to\nchange that title as well we can change\nit from here like just type\nit so this\nis what to show hi options available\nchart details and chart details as well\nthere are various options available here\nwhich we can select\nuh uh then there are um if you do full\nscreen will just show up in the full\nscreen mode uh just to make sure that it\nis like that we can exit the full screen\nas well if you want and we can add some\ncross calculation hyperlink Etc as well\nas linked analysis another thing which\nwe will see in detail what is linked\nanalysis and how we can do it so that we\nwill see in detail but for the now this\nis what how it is now we can add some\nthree values to it so three shold is\nsomething which is we can say um\nhighlighting the data with the different\ncolors so maybe red color shows uh\nnegative mean revenue or in loss or\ngreen means it is in profit the\nbusinesses so that kind of um level so\nit will be highlighting for that\nthreshold conditional formatting is you\ncan use so we can add uh thresholds to\nfor conditional formatting so just click\non this add threshold and once we have\nADD threshold uh we can uh select the\nmeasure here means let's say means we\nwanted to uh apply the threshold uh on\nthis uh net revenue Sals so we can give\nsome range so this is the options to\ngive it here so we can say if it is\ngreen color or there are green like\ngreen is then warning then uh critical\nfair so if it is okay then we can give\nsome range uh so let's say me this is\nsomething which is which is\num 400,000 we can say means is greater\nthan then it is green we can have have\nADD range of warning as well means if it\nis Falls below 3,000 or something which\nis uh greater uh greater than or equal\nto uh 3 3,000 then it is in a warning uh\n[Music]\nto warning and uh the less than if it is\nless than\n400,000 uh then and so this is a warning\nand another we can add as a critical if\nit is less than 3,000 as well then uh\nand greater than zero uh then it\nis so this is something which is we can\ngive it here and then once we apply this\nuh you will see mean it depends upon\nmean the conditions the colors get\nchanged so this is the way means we can\nadd it here so I have added a few other\nmeasures as well here like gross margin\nand gross margin percentage as well uh\nso if you say means this is what I have\ndone me just similar way gross margin\nhas been added like net sales revenue\nbut this is just a measure taken and\nthen gross margin uh percentage is one\nthing which is I have uh created which\nis uh like this uh which is sales Mar uh\ngross gross margin divided by the net\nsales revenue which is and uh this is\nwhat uh the percentage has been\ncalculated for this gross margin and uh\nthere are some other in The Styling uh\nyou can give um uh the formatting or the\nscaling that uh have given here uh for\nnumber format so if if you say in the\nnumber so let net sales revenue I have\nmade it as thousand and then um in the\nscale format we can choose it's km or\nBon for thousand million billion like\nthis or we can have it like so suppose\nif I wanted to change it it will show\nlike this so this is how I have done it\nhere uh we can uh select some other\noptions show currency and show um unit\nif you want means that is what means it\nis there means if you want um and uh\nthere are some other like decimal places\nas well we can select how many decimal\nplaces we wanted to uh have the signs as\nwell we can display plus or minus or in\nthe bracket so that is what there are\nsome other formatting like format uh\nlike what is all text formatting what is\nwhat the uh chart title subtitle and all\nthose things should look like so let's\nsay me I wanted to uh chart title make\nit as aial and\nsize is 12 it is like I want to make it\nas\n20 and I wanted to make it as bold as\nwell so that is we can do it I wanted to\nmake it color is something\ndifferent so this way we can uh do it uh\nthis formatting for all of the measures\nso you can say say uh what are the\ncalculat measures or the direct measures\nwe have taken we can do a formatting of\nit uh we can do bordering as well so it\nis given here what is the B borders\nwhich which we can give all the borders\nso I have selected this the style which\ntype of style we want it to have uh so\nwe can choose it the Border color as\nwell we can choose it for for light line\nwidth as so this is a corner radius so\nif you don't make it it will be square\ncor um like or else means it will be\njust changing so these are some of the\nthings border are not supp for mobile\ndevices so when it views in the mobile\nso it is not possible to uh view the\nborders in the mobiles so this is one\nthing we need to uh\nremember so this is uh we have done all\nthis gross margin gross margin\npercentage and others like net sales\nrevenue for uh so we can view this uh we\nwill take it forward we will build other\nchart charts and all those things uh\nwith this um uh in the next videos in\nthis video we will see about the line\nchart uh continuing to our creating\nstory for different components the first\ncomponent we have seen about the numeric\nchart in the previous video now let's\nsee is how to add line chart and various\nproperties of the line chart uh what are\nthe different things which we can do\nwith line charts to add line chart just\nclick on this insert uh charts option\nhere uh you can uh see uh there are\ndifferent charts available so we will\nselect from this as line chart\nfirst and once we select this line chart\nwe need to specify at least Y AIS or\nright right or left Y axis so the first\nthing is uh to select the measures so\nhere we will see gross margin is the one\nthing which is we wanted to see right\nnow we will not take me suppose we do\nwanted to see some other measures as\nwell so sales revenue or quantity kind\nother measures that we can select it\nhere but for now we just just select a\ngross margin here uh add Dimension is\nwhich we will select we there are\ndifferent different but for now which is\nvery meaningful means we can see a date\nwise uh gross margin for uh which which\nuh which can be selected as for for the\ndimensions this is all that for now me\nwhen we select this is it will just have\noption automatically up drilling down as\nwell so different different uh years uh\nand if if you wanted to go up we can uh\ngo to the upper level as well from here\nwhen we click on that uh there is when\nwe say Dimensions we can uh do our own\nfiltering of the data with the help of\nthis filter uh uh options which is uh\nfilter by member filter by uh filter by\nmember is just a selection uh of the\nyears and quarters filter by range is\nabout the particular time period and\nthen we can select current\nyear uh\nbasically to for the specific one so\nlet's say me let's see filter by member\nfirst one so for now means we have\ndifferent different years that we can\nselect U uh however we can also select\nfor some specific year we wanted to see\nthe four quarter uh so you can see it\nhere and there are some other options\nwhich is allow Vios to modify selection\ngenerally uh we should be allowing the\nusers to modify the selection mean it\njust filtering So based on the filters\nmean the users can uh choose their\nshould not allow viewers to delete the\nfilter hide in control panels uh so the\nexisting filters we should be keeping\nthat uh there is multiple selection or\nsingle selection so it can be possible\nthat multiple values can be selected\nover the chart so once you click on this\nokay now you can see this chart has been\ncreated you can see this uh year 2014\nlet's do so uh once we have this uh we\ncan use different different uh options\nuh to be selected here uh which is uh\nformatting and all those things so\nsuppose this is uh line uh so you can\nsee this is the year 2013 this is year\n14 which is for each quarter so suppose\nwe if you wanted to go drill down as\nwell we can go with the with that\nparticular year and for each year it has\nuh January to February so as this is the\ndrillable or this is a hierarchy\ncomponent and that's why this drilling\nis possible here on this chart the\ndrilling is possible we can go again uh\nI mean it's it's year and quarter um um\nhierarchy Set uh basically if it is year\nquarter month or day and then it we can\ngo to the uh lowest level of the\nhierarchy which is day as well so that\nis also possible uh we can when we\nselect this line uh you can see there is\na styling option here we and where we\ncan select uh different uh formatting\noptions which is uh data point so\nsuppose this data point is nothing but\nthe points which are shown up here uh we\ncan give different colors uh to this\nsuppose I wanted to show uh this data\npoints in a different color uh this\nformatting and all those things we can\nspecify with all these things uh the\nformatting uh we can say me if it is\nthousand million or billion for now\nlet's say select is a, um so when we\nselect thousand it will come as\nautomatically here in, so whatever the\nfigure it is showing is here earlier it\nwas a complete figure of 65,000 some\n7500 something so that has been changed\nin Thousand so it has been like 65,000\nuh 6575 so this figure is in Thousand so\nthis we can give um uh then scale\nformatting we can specify thousand\nmillion uh again same formatting which\nwe can do\nuh Legions so what are the legions we\nare having we can have it above or below\nchart so suppose we want to have it uh\nthe legion uh so that can be possible to\nuh appear here this uh three uh let's do\nsome full screen this so that it will be\nhelpful for our understanding uh now uh\nwe can see there are different\nproperties available here uh if you\nclick on this uh you can actually sort\nby\nuh then gross margin and uh there are\nother options as well here uh by sort\nlike earliest to latest so this is also\nwe can uh do it or we can uh sort in uh\nbased on the latest to\nearliest so you can see this date has\nformatting has changed 2015 then to4 and\n13 then uh now we can uh select some\nother properties which is ranking so we\ncan select a top five ranking uh so this\nis also one so what is the top five\nvalues that it is possible to see it\nhere as well uh we can select just\nbottom f as well so this gets changed\nnow\num we don't want to select this so I'm\njust rting it on the changes now uh\nthere are some other proper properties\nwhich is compared to which is previous\nperiod or previous year or previous\nquarter so when we select previous\nperiod it will show the difference\nbetween the uh see uh what is the\ndifference between this value and this\nso minus uh this is the minus so you can\nsee how it has been compared over the\nprevious when we apply this filter you\ncan see this variance as well here which\nis with the previous period this this\nway we can do the comparison with the\nprevious year previous quarter and if\nyou select this open variance pel as\nwell uh then also it is possible to see\nwhat are the variance and all those\nthings so we suppose we have something\nsome values to be compared that we can\ngive it here uh so which is all measures\nor some measures which we are having and\nto which it is to be compared so that we\ncan uh give it here uh for for\nthis now uh let's go back uh to now uh\nnow coming to the other properties of\nthis chart see uh add smart Insight so\nthis is also very powerful U feature\nwhich is available with the CP antic\nCloud uh when we say artmart Insight it\nwill show up the values uh means when we\nrun it so like see uh so basically uh\nwhen uh when we uh open this chart it\nwill show the smart inside for gross\nmargin for 2003 is the top top\ncontributor so as you see is from this\nuh actually it will use the antics\ntechnology and based on that it it will\nsuggest different different uh important\nor critical um data from this analysis\nso this is very powerful uh so which\nwill be helpful for the business users\nto take the decisions faster we can add\nsome reference line as well suppose we\nhave some reference line of\nlike 50,000 so this is this is one uh\nBenchmark we wanted to set and based on\nthat means it is helpful so this is we\ncan say it's\na reference range so this is the\nreference range uh which which is there\nand the different things so there are\ndifferent things which we can do with\nthis reference range and it is helpful\nuh to measure the performance of the\nparticular business how it is performing\nmean whether it is going good in terms\nof year-wise data or quarter wise data\nor it is having some issues with the\nbusiness data now you can see there are\nsome other options available as well\nmobile end is fine then we can say\nadding forecast as well automatic\nforecast we can add there is one more\nabout the reference line which is fixed\nand uh dynamic as well so we can give\nsome reference uh to this fixed in fixed\nwhere we can specify some specific value\nuh like 50,000 or something as a\nreference value and in Dynamic actually\nwe can select the measure which is\ncoming from the database or the model so\nthat range we can give it here and uh\nits aggregation whether it is maximum or\nminimum that we can uh\nselect and label also we can uh give it\nthe next point is to add uh conditional\nformatting or a threshold values so that\nwe can format our line chart as per as\nfor the values which is given here to do\nthis we can just clear select here add\nDimension or threshold and from here we\ncan select the d uh measures which is\nalready there we have created a\nconditional formatting so you can see me\nbased on this conditional formatting uh\nthis points has been changed uh the\ncolors has been changed because we have\nalready created um conditional\nformatting for gross margin for the\nnumeric point chart uh so that is uh it\nhas taken we can edit the ranges so edit\nedit range means it will be uh the one\nwhich is here uh we can uh suppose uh we\ncan select this is uh 65,000 or\nsomething uh let's say six\nso this way if you do this um this will\nuh show the various conditional\nformatting results so you can see uh the\ngreen ones are okay the orange ones are\nwarning and the critical ones so you can\nsee the color has been\nchanged for for this di thresholds so\nthis is one thing which we can do and\nthe tool tip is also it will show up me\nfor which it is threshold is gross\nmarging what is this stra uh State like\nuh okay or uh warning or critical after\nthat means we will see what is trailing\nuh so there is one more option of having\nadd traes so this is traes is one option\nwhich is available where we can divide\nour chart to different different\ndivisions like uh if you say based on\nthe dimensions available we can divide\nour chart so suppose we wanted to uh\ndivide this chart on the straight part\nso we can do this by using this one so\nyou can see this is for California\nNevada and Oran so you can see different\ndifferent charts available for this uh\nuh state wise uh basically uh if you\nwanted to uh change this uh instead of\nchart uh we can do uh select some other\num Dimensions as well which will be\nhelpful to see let's do it on a city So\nbased on because there will be multiple\ncities you can see there are different\ndifferent charts are getting created and\nuh this is what how it it looks like so\nthis is a very good uh point to as well\nuh to create it uh different uh charts\nfor different different cities and if\nthat is something which is needed for uh\ndifferent date ranges that is also we\ncan uh do it let's remove it I don't\nwant to uh make it as for state wise or\ncity wise distribution so I'm just\nremoving this traes so when this is\nneeded we can uh do this uh so I'm just\nuh now this this is what we have done\ntill now miss with this dashboard and uh\nuh we wanted to uh select like\nthis for now uh this is what means we do\nhave a numeric point chart for Sal net\nsales revenue and gross margin and we\nhave gross margin line chart as well uh\nat the moment let's learn about stor\ntelling visualization basic calculation\nand formatting uh it is important\nunderstand what are the things we which\nwe can do while we create the stories\nfor our\napplications so what is story basically\nuh Story how uh this is one sample uh\nstory which is given on the right side\nof this where we can see different\ndifferent charts and uh different um you\ncan see some of the range filters date\nrange filters some of the options\navailable here so that user can select\nany of the product and then they can see\ntheir respective uh any details here so\nthis is something which is uh nothing\nbut a story and how this story can be\ncreated there are different uh ways to\ncreate we can create U choose some\ncustom templates provided by SA or we\ncan create our own um templates directly\nor we can just start our own design as\nwell uh so that we will see practically\nas well how to create\nit now when we uh say story structure or\nwhat is the\ndefining of story structure we need to\nunderstand means um uh three pages which\nis canvas grid and responsive Pages we\nhave already seen this in the previous\nvideos where we have seen what is canvas\nwhat is grid and what is responsive page\nso we need to use one of them to make um\nthe story run a smart Discovery for data\nanalysis we can do this by using uh\nsmart Discovery option and um then how\nto uh create stories or what are the\ndesign to choose so we can either create\na new design or we can uh use the\ntemplates provided by sap or the\ntemplates customized by our business so\nthat is also we can\ndo so when we say creating a\nvisualizations there are different\ndifferent components which are available\ncharts tables maps and all these valory\npicture pictogram all of these\ncomponents are very useful and we need\nto understand theun of each and every\ncomponent so that it will be helpful to\nbuild our powerful\nvisualizations while using it as well we\nneed to understand means how to use them\nor how to make most most of it uh so\nthat our visualizations are very uh\npowerful or user friendly so we need to\nfirst we need to select the choose\ndirection or importance of visualization\nso we need to see means what we need to\nsee show on the top or what we wanted to\nshow on the bottom or in the the middle\nor um like that uh we need to make it\nuser friendly so that it is a simple\nreading direction we need to follow the\nformat means um left to right or kind of\nreading format then logical grouping uh\norder where where we need to place the\ncomponent so it should be located next\nto each other so that it it is easily\nreadable to the user so this is what we\nneed to um make sure that our\nvisualizations are placed uh correctly\non the on the\nstorage then we will see some of the uh\ndata preparation while we do data\npreparation like model creation uh when\nwe acquire data then uh there are two\ntypes of aggregation uh standard\naggregation and exception aggregation so\nstandard aggregation and exception\naggregations are very important to\nunderstand means so standard aggregation\nare the aggregation which are uh defined\nat the data source level or from the\ndatabase or and the exception\naggregation are defined at the model\nlevel in the sap\nAntics so here is one example which says\nsome of this so this is standard\naggregation coming from the U database\nas a expected revenue and uh which is\npredefined in the data source of the\ndata model while exception aggregation\nis something which is not part of the\ndata source but uh it is it is defined\nin the model so exception aggregation\ncan be applied from a model or a story\nand this is one of the the average\nfunction which is here used which says\nwhich is a exception aggregation\napplied how to add exception aggregation\nso that we will see practically how to\nadd and these are some of the exception\naggregation types which which are like\nthis sum in Max average first last as\nwell so that um we will see this\npractically how to use this so that it\nwill be helpful for to understand all\nthis with the\nexamples in this video we will learn\nabout creating bar chart or column chart\nand then we will also see how to create\na stacked bar column chart as well and\nuh in the charts how to drill uh up and\ndrill down uh in the chart so that also\nwe will see in this uh video we do have\nalready our story created which is\nhaving a numeric point chart and the\nline chart which we already created in\nour previous videos so continuing to\nthat story only we will be adding a um\nchat so let's edit this in the designer\nmode we can just add chart so insert\nchart from here and then we can select\nfirst is bar or column chart that we are\ngoing to see so in this bar or column\nchart we will see gross margin for um\neach product by state so what is the\ngross margin so that we will see we will\nsee uh chart orientation we will see uh\nset as horizontal only uh the first\nthing is we need to add a measure so the\nmeasure will be gross margin percentage\nthat's what we are going to take and\nthen Dimension will be product because\nfor product only we need to find the\ncross margin and then um the color will\nbe also means we need to select because\nor the dimension measure so that we can\nsee uh for each state or location we\nwanted to uh see so let's add this state\nas\ncolored here uh this is how it is now\nuh now we can enable Legion as well here\njust to show the legion so that it will\nbe helpful to see means you can\nsee this\nand how it looks like right now we have\nthis um colors so we can switch this\ncolors as well if you want means based\non these colors we can uh select\ndifferent colors if you feel means we\nwanted to select um so you can see for\neach state like California newk and oron\nwe can see this uh product how it is\nperformed so now uh there is a drilling\nuh also available here if you click on\nthis uh we can see uh the drill drill\noptions here if you click on this it it\ngoes to that particular uh State and for\nthat particular product so we can see\ndrill down and drill up we can do it hit\nfrom here uh the drill drill set as for\nlevel one level two as well so let's say\nwe can can go to up to level two as well\nfrom here as well so this is the default\none which is available here so this is a\ndrilling uh we can do with uh this uh\ncolumn uh chart so we should name\nthis what is\ngross margin percentage for each product\nby\nState this is the one uh question which\nis uh maybe business users we wanted to\nsee for each product what is the gross\nmargin percentage now the next point is\nabout adding stacked bar column chart\nwhere we wanted to see how each product\nhas performed over period of time so\nlet's add a chart here uh in this we\nwill add uh stacked bar column chart and\nuh we will keep its U orientation as\nvertical and we will select uh net sales\nrevenue as we wanted to see the\nperformance of the product so uh net\nsales revenue is the one um measure we\nare going to select and dimension we\nwill see as we wanted to see over the\nperiod select the date uh as the field\nand then color will be we will be sing\nthe selecting the product because based\non the product only we wanted to see how\nfor each year how it has been performed\nand so you can see me now this is\nshowing like this so we can show the\nlegions here so that it will be helpful\nto identify it we let's do a full screen\nas well now you can see for each year\nthis is for all year we can uh see that\nhierarchy or drilling is enabled here\nyou can just go by date or product so\nthere are two options available by which\ndate or product you wanted to go to the\ndrills by using this we can go to uh\ndate again in the detail you can see uh\nfor quarter one uh quarter 2 quarter\nthree quarter 4 for each year for which\nuh uh which product has performed better\nso you can see this orange color is uh\nperform better we can go more in detail\nuh to see how uh this has been performed\nin the that particular quarter and which\nmonth is having highest uh sales so here\nyou can see the August month is and by\nusing this August month data we can see\nwhy this has been uh having highest\nsales revenue maybe some there are some\ndifferent different um scenarios or\nbusiness situations which uh pop the\nhigher revenue for that particular\nproduct in that duration and why the\nJuly and September is having less uh\ndata for that particular sales so that\nuh that this values can be uh can be\ndrilled we can go in August month which\nproduct has performed over better so in\nthe August month we can see this is one\nthing which is orange with pulp is\nperform well in this we can uh go drill\nup again now with the date\nwe can go again with the\ndate and for this\nyear so we can say means by product we\ncan show so suppose if you wanted for\nthis year we wanted to see now we can go\nto directly uh drilling on uh product as\nwell instead of data as well so for 2013\nwhich is the uh product so this is also\nit is able to show up so we can give\nsome dat is what is how is the product\nhas performed over the period of time so\nthis is one thing which is wanted to see\nbusiness managers wanted to see the\nperformance of the particular uh product\nover year month-wise and quarter wise as\nwell so that we can uh set up with this\nstack bar column so it is very useful to\nsee the data in this way and different\ndifferent colors we can select different\ncolors from here and there are some\nother things which we can do this as\nwell to just see useful in this video we\nwill learn about creating calcul\nmeasures with the input controls and\nalso creating restricted measures\ncalculated measures so let's try to\ncreate one chart uh this simple bar\nchart I'm taking uh which is selecting\nas a horizontal let's say and adding a\noriginal sales price as a d measure and\nI'm adding a dimension of the product so\njust wanted to see a product original\nprice and here we can add a new\ncalculation uh measure which will use\nincremental sales for that particular\nmeasure do that uh let's add add\nmeasures and in this uh instead of\nselecting any uh available one create\ncalculation and in this uh we can uh\nselect this is a calculated uh measure\nand incremental uh\ncells so this is the name for this U\ncalculated measure we are going to\nselect new input control so input\ncontrol act as a variable uh and which\ncan be used to calculate the measure\nvalues or to just change the values\nwithout modifying the underlying data in\nthe model so create uh model we can give\nuh some name to uh this as incremental\nFactor we can say and we can select\neither existing Dimension suppose we can\nselect any other dimension which we\nwanted to multiply with the original\nsales price uh something we need to\ndivide or something some that that also\nwe can do with this existing Dimension\nuh model and then uh we can select\ndifferent different uh Dimensions from\nit but for now the other way is to\ncreate the static where we can just give\nsome static values data type we can\nselect as number and then uh we can say\nwe can select by range suppose we wanted\nto give some range then we can give\nminimum and maximum range and we can uh\nincrement by whatever number we wanted\nto increment uh the other one is to add\na select by member we can just give some\nlike let's say 2.5 comma\n5 comma 10 so this is something which is\nwe wanted to give uh we can give\nmultiple selection but in this case as\nwe just wanted to uh increment by this\nuh single uh incremental Factor we will\nselect as a single selection because\nthis will affect because otherwise we\nneed to select all this and that is not\ngoing to be valid here now I have\nselected uh this input values and I'm\nclicking on okay now you can see\nincremental Factor uh is one input\ncontrol has been created so that is one\nkind of variable we can say now let's\nadd this original price sales price and\nwe will just incre uh multiply that with\nthe incremental Factor so this is what\nwe we are going to do we'll just verify\nthis formula whether it is valid or not\nand just create click on okay now you\ncan see this chart has been changed now\nthe initial uh Blue Line uh chart is\nabout uh the original sales spr and then\nthe orange one is\nincremental now we can uh see the\nformula as well incremental sales is one\nformula which is here uh you can see uh\nif you do multiply uh do select five as\nincremental then this value gets changed\nwhatever the orange one it gets changed\nso uh it is like first is 34 is the\noriginal 34682 is the original sales\nprice it will be multiplied by five now\nnow if you select uh the 10 then it will\nget multiplied by\n10 So based on this we can select it or\nelse we can just select 3.2 or 2.5 which\nis just getting multiplied with that so\nonce we select this this original price\ngets change original price will be same\nbut the incremental sales uh can be uh\nchanged based on this selection so users\ncan uh select this incremental sales Me\nMaybe This is required for their\nanalysis how the sales can be improved\nfor that particular product\nand may maybe they can give the target\nto their sales people so that they can\nsee this is what we need to have the\nincremental sales means Maybe by 2.5% or\nmaybe 5% or maybe 10% kind of so that\nkind of incremental sales they can just\nsee here on the this this is what we can\nuh do with this calculated measures with\nthe in uh input\ncontrols now the next point is about the\ncreating restricted measures the\nrestricted measures are just one kind of\nfilter to uh the charts uh which we can\nuh create and Suppose there is a\nrequirement that some charts just wanted\nto filter out on some of the values of\nsome of the dimensions so then we can uh\nselect this restricted measures to do\nthis just go back to the charts measures\nadd measures option and in here we will\nselect create calculation and uh in this\nwe will select restricted measures not\nthe calculated measure and we will see\nlet's say me this charts we just wanted\nto see for\nCalifornia uh so here we can uh select\noriginal uh sales price and this is just\nto be selected for um let's say uh\nlocation or maybe state wise so it it it\nthen we can select the values uh so we\nhave the select by member so in this we\nwill see uh this the state values which\nwhich are there and based on that\nsuppose we just wanted to filter out for\nC California then we will select that uh\nwe can add another dimension as well me\nif there are some other dimensions we\nwanted to filter out so this is the way\nwe create restricted measures now once\nwe create the restricted measures you\ncan see a new uh green um bar has and\ncome here with the California state\nmeans for this particular so you can see\nmeans wherever so for these juices and\nothers there is no sales for this uh in\nthe California that's why it is not\nshown up here if there is a data then it\nwill show up so this is how we can\ncreate the we can create the restricted\nmeasure now the third type of\ncalculation is the difference from we\nhave already created one chart which\nwhich is giving gross margin percentage\nfor each product by state now we will\njust duplicate this chart and we will\nsee uh the difference uh with the\nprevious year so to do this just to copy\nuh and paste this chart uh we can see\nthis um is created here we can see uh to\ncreate a new calculation again we will\ngo to add\nmeasure and in this again we will see\ncreate calculation here uh instead of\ncalculated measure or restricted measure\nwe will see a third type of calculation\ntype which is difference from and we\nwill give this cross margin\npercentage that we can select uh we will\nselect the gross margin as the measure\nwhich is here the time Dimension will be\nour date Dimension because we are going\nto compare with the\nperiods uh now when we select a minus B\nis the two things which we need to\nconsider so the we need to select the\nfirst uh um time which is uh current\ndate or maybe select Me by member so we\nwill select select members so we wanted\nto compare with the uh 2014 to the\nprevious year so we will select this uh\nthe previous one uh 2014 here and uh to\nprevious to end period whether uh we\nwanted to compare with the previous one\nyear or previous two year or previous 3\nyears so whatever value it may be have\nor whatever the values we wanted to\nverify uh compare that we can select it\nhere now set no to data as zero so this\nis fine means when there is no data then\nwe can say as no zero calculate as\npercentage so calculate as percentage\nwhen we select then we need to divide it\nby some other values so we will select\nit here uh with the compare value or to\nthe value so whatever the value which is\n2014 divid by 2013 that's what the value\nwe can select uh to just create this now\nonce we have created it uh just click on\nokay now uh we can uh see this uh which\nis here let's do this full screen so\nthat we can see what is the difference\nnow when we say you can see this is the\nfor 20134 what is the this is the\nprevious year and this is the current\nyear difference so you can see uh this\ncompare from 20134 California and NADA\nthis three states it is showing\ndifferent different here as you can see\nuh this is the original one you can see\nthis colors the higher and the\ndifference one is are shown here which\nis shown up here the legion shows the\ndifference so for uh this is for 20134\nfor California California it has\npositive difference and for other two it\nhas for NADA for Nevada it has minus\ndifference and for Oregon State also it\nhas difference so this is how it is can\ncreate difference from calc calculation\ntype in this video that's what we have\ncovered we have covered creating\ncalculat measures with the input control\nthen we have covered about the\nrestricted measure creating restricted\nme measure with the example and now we\nhave saw about creating difference from\nuh calculation uh type as well in this\nvideo we will learn about various key\nperformance indicators then page filters\nreference lines uh story filters and how\nwe can apply various key key performance\nindicators so basically key performance\nindicator indicators are very important\nto understand because it is something\nwhich is a business uh objective which\nare set when the business is being run\nbusiness managers or the top management\npeople will see how the business is\nperforming and they will man monitor the\nuh business using the key performance\nindicators that is kpi performance is\nnot meeting the criteria about of the\nkpis then the system May throw some\nalerts to the uh business so that they\nwill uh they can take the necessary\nactions now uh to see first we will see\nhow to create a bullet chart which is\nshowing the different different um kpi\nlike key performance indicator so to do\nthis just add bullet chart from here um\nso we can say uh indicator this this is\na chart type which is we are going to\nselect one is bullet\nand from here we uh we will add first as\na gross margin uh as one of the\nmeasure and it it needs state or\nlocation which is\nuh and the color color will be based on\nthe product what we are having the\nthreshold value which has we have\ncreated which is for gross margin so\nthis gross margin um which is one option\nwe have created already uh as a\nthreshold or conditional formatting\nwhere we already set some values which\nis number range and uh which which has\nthese values which we have set and based\non this it will highlight whether it is\nokay uh whether it is a warning or\ncritical uh things when when we open\nthis uh let's do this a full screen so\nnow you can see where uh the business\nvalues stand so this is the um line\nwhich is there which says uh this for\nCalifornia uh this is the gross margin\nwhich is which is falling in critical\nfor Nevada we can see it is uh in the\nwarning things and also for Oregon as\nwell it is so when we when we Mouse over\non it you can see gross margin is 55,000\nsome 140 and then what is the threshold\nuh threshold range and what is the\nstatus so it will show up as warning as\nwell this way we can create the bullet\ncharts which will suggest uh the\nbusiness how the business is going on\nand based on this the business users can\nuh take decisions then now the next uh\nthing is about creating a reference line\nuh reference lines is one thing where uh\nwe can set some uh references to the\nvalues we are getting from the charts so\nmaybe average reference values or or\nmaximum or minimum re reference value so\nto do this we will add one more chart\nhere uh just for U creating of this uh\nso let's do a chart adding um which is a\ncolumn chart we can say and um\nhorizontal we will say um again a gross\nmargin or gross margin we will select\nand gross margin was once we have\nselected um we will\nuh select the dimension as um location\nor\nstate so that it will come like this now\nonce we have this we can set uh this um\nwe can select the dimension as well uh\nlet's say a\nproduct now uh we can we need to add a\nreference lines to do this reference\nline we we'll just go to this uh option\nhere and select add reference line from\nhere now there are two types of\nreference lines which is one is fixed\nand um the other one is dynamic so try\nto uh use uh fix one let's say means we\nhave we are setting 100 um million uh\nvalue which is there as a reference and\nuh we will say this is an average as a\nlabel uh you can see this is we can\nselect some colors to the lines as well\nso let's say this is uh label color and\nline color as well\nso this is a fixed uh fixed value and\nsuppose um what happens when we use a\nfixed reference line uh when we drill\ndown on this\nvalue the average value will remain same\nit is 100 million it is not going to\nchange so this is a drawback we can say\nmeans uh when we wanted to use a\nreference line uh so uh when whenever it\nis necessary means we can we should\nusing Dynamic uh reference line which is\nhere now let's try to use this uh\nreference value as a\ndynamic now when in Dynamic we can just\ndirectly select our measures and uh\nbased on that means we can uh select so\ngross margin is average so whatever the\nmeasures we have taken uh it\nautomatically calculate the average uh\nwe can see actuals is the version means\nbased on the actual values the average\nshould be calculate calculated so\nmaximum and minimum reference we can can\nuse it here U but basically average is\nthe reference we should be using uh the\nother things uh is average is the label\nand once we apply this now the\ndifference is when we apply this Dynamic\nreference line uh when we click on\nthis uh or when we drill down on this\nany of the\nproduct the average uh gets changed so\nthis is the reference for this now um\nwhen we go in the up level you can see\nreference value is\n39,7 32 but when we go down to the next\nlevel the average changes to whatever\nthe value it is having Suppose there are\nmore than three or four categories in\nthis product then uh based on that three\nor four product categories the average\nwill be calculated and it will be\ndisplayed so this will be a dynamic and\nthis is what it should be I think uh we\nshould be using uh when we wanted to use\nuh Dynamic uh reference lines now uh\nnext point is we should be using is\nabout about the story filters and the\npage filters so uh story filters\nactually apply to the uh particular um\ncomponent or chart while page filter\nwill be applying for the complete uh\npage filter so to do this story filter\nwhenever we have the any any of the\nchart we can just write uh click on here\nhere or Mouse click on here you can see\ntheir filter gets applied so filter on\nselected data point so when when we\nselect this it automatically filter out\non that particular product and we can\nremove this filter from here as well uh\nso this way this is a story filter which\nis actually U chart filter we can say\nwhich is applied here now there is\nanother uh filter which is uh for this\nparticular page filter all the page\nfilter uh all the page components will\nbe filter out based on that so for that\nwhat we can do we can add input control\nfrom here and from this we can select uh\nthe measures or the dimensions on which\nwe wanted to uh select date range is\ndate is one dimension which we have\nbased on that we wanted to so filter by\nmember or filter by range so when we say\nfilter by range we can filter it from\nhere with the years um and the other\nother is filter by so the filter by\nrange is one thing which is based on the\ndynamic or fixed one so Dynamic will be\nbasically whatever the range it is\nhaving it it will be displayed there\nbased on the values which\nare for for a particular duration fixed\nfixed will be whatever the values right\nnow it is having it will take like this\nuh so 2013 201 2016 uh suppose we don't\nhave the data then we can say for three\nthese three years only we wanted to see\nhierarchy also we need to specify year\nquarter month Suppose there is some\nother hierarchy we wanted to choose we\ncan choose it from here year month only\nif you don't want to go to quarter level\nas well now the range is granity from\nhere it will start from 2013 to 14 uh\nthat's what we can uh select new Range\nalso we can add it here where we can\nspecify quarter wise uh year quarter uh\nmonth filter as well now our um now\nallow you viewers to modify the\nselection this is fine means it should\nbe users can uh modify the\nselections uh users can select multiple\nselection or single selection uh that we\ncan select and click okay now here once\nwe click on here uh you can see that\npage filter is applied here let me let\nme move this to here you can see this is\nthe filter which is used uh or it is\ngetting displayed like this and from\nthis we can select like I mean suppose\nwe just wanted to select the data for\none uh year only then uh uh this this uh\ncan be done from here\nand um or from this drop down as well\nyou can select So based on this filter\nuh the data gets changed and all the all\nthe components all the charts when we\nuse this date filter uh we can um get it\napplied on all the chart components so\nwhich is very useful uh so this is a\npage page filter uh which can be used\nlike\nthis uh that's it from this video I hope\nyou have understood this components we\nhave covered about the bullet blet chart\nthen reference line then story filter\npage filters as well this is our story\nwhich we have created uh using the\ndifferent different components uh and\nall the videos which we have seen as in\nprevious to this\nvideo covers most all the Practical uh\nthings what how we have implemented this\nuh different different charts we have\nstarted with the numic uh numeric chart\nthen line chart then we have seen stack\nbar chart as well column as well then\nuh we have seen the column bar chart uh\nwith with its different calculation type\nlike C calculated measures restricted\nmeasures then difference from measures\nand how to use that uh then we have also\nseen the reference line where we have\nseen what is fixed reference line and\ndynamic reference line then we have seen\nthe input controls which is the DAT\nrange filter here where we can apply the\ndate range filter for this also we have\nseen the buet bullet chart for for\nhaving this kind of kpi indicator how\nthe business is performing uh so it is\nuseful uh then we have also seen uh\ndifferent uh components or different uh\nfeatures like linked analysis adding\npage filter or adding uh story filters\nor chart filters so these all we have\ncovered till now and we will continue to\nuh improve this story with the new uh\nfeatures which s is having and like GE\nmap so we will see that in next video so\nplease watch my videos for the next uh\nunderstanding I have all given the links\nfor this video description for all these\ncomponents uh in this so you can go\nthrough this uh one by one if you have\nmissed that in this video we will learn\nabout the data integration with sap bw4\nHana and sapes to that sap analytics\nCloud there are some basic concepts we\nwill try to understand in this video and\nuh practically we will see how this can\nbe use uh used or implemented so let's\nsee me what are the advantage of thep\nbw4 Hana uh so it is an investment uh we\ncan leverage the investment into SP BW\nand provide the users with the Antics\nBeyond data discy as so we can directly\nconsume BW data without data replication\nso there is no data refresh or data\nreplication needed when we can connect\nto thep BW data BW for Hana we can\nutilize the native BW query Concepts to\nget most about out of your data we can\nuse uh reuse the existing authorization\nconcepts for data level security so\nwhatever the security which is an\napplied at the B for Hana site that can\nsame be applied at the SCP antic Cloud\nwe can continue establish best practices\nso what are the best practices used at\nsbw for Hana for views and all those\nthings query design life cycle\nmanagement data level authorization that\nall can be used in scps\nCloud so what are the connectivity\nfeatures\nor the functionality we can say means\nwhich is direct secure and simple so\nthis is one um basic and like full thing\nwe can have we can connect directly um\nto BW queries or generated Han views in\nour on premise sapbw systems and once we\nconnect there is no additional modeling\nis required we just need to connect to\nto the sap Hana views or the scbw\nqueries and no data replication in the\nSCP Antics Cloud as well as it will\nhappen on Real Time with thep Hana data\nremains behind your corporate firewall\nwhen running queries and displaying\nresults no authorization replication\nneeded as PBW authorizations are fully\nrespected uh end to endend integration\nis another feature which is ability to\naccess SCP BW and SCP Han features that\ncannot be accessed through standard\nquery interface so some of the query\ninterfaces like SQL or um multiple\nDimensions queries so they cannot\ndirectly access some of the features\nfrom sapbw but sap ant can do\nit use of unique based in class query\ninterface to SAP BW and sap Han engines\nthat is also possible query interface is\ncontinuously enounced alongside sbw and\nHan engine\nenhancments so in summary what are the\ntopics we what are the points we can\nconsider chart to chart um filtering uh\ncreate filters or drill through\nhierarchal data in one chart we can use\nB BW\nvariable um prompt as\nannouncements BW variant personalization\nconsumption BW structures we can use BW\nstructures we can have need doable\nconnections integation with the BW query\nuh techniques and parallel execution of\nthe BW queries that will be helpful for\nthe performance optimization of the\nanalysis applications integrating with\nsap Universe when we say in sap\nuniverses which is sap business objects\nuniverses which are created in the\ninformation design tool or the universe\ndesigner so we have to use live data\nconnections so when we use live\nconnections there data no data will be\nstored in the cloud or it is it is on\ndemand connection so all the data will\nbe uh retriev when it is needed from the\napp applications a replicative data\ninput connection data will be stored in\nthe cloud and upd within interval so you\ncan see me um there are two ways we can\nconnect to the sap and data universes\none is live data and data input so when\nwe say data input uh connection we need\nto have SCP Cloud connector sacp Cloud\nconnector and sap analytics Cloud agent\ntwo main additional components we need\nhere to connect to when we use live data\nconnections it is just a browser or and\nscpb data connect on BI platform from\nlaunch pad we can use that and and just\nconnect to that sap inis so when we say\nrequirement of the live connections and\nthe data in uh data import then we see\num this is SCP Cloud connected andp\nAntics Cloud agent that's what it is\nshown here in the in this diagram as\nwell and for live connection we can just\nneed to set the some of the bo\nproperties uh which we should have this\nconnection uh of the bo. temporary\ndocument folder which holds the name of\nthe folder that is created inside each\nuser favorite folder when they consum\nlive data connections so we will see\nthis practically um with how to\nconfigure this and how to connect to the\ndifferent\nuniverses in this video we will see\nlinked analysis and examine data\nfunctionality of the sap Antics Cloud uh\nthese are the two important Concepts\nwhich we should be able to understand\nand we will see this practically how to\nimplement this firstly what is linked\nanalysis so linked analysis means um we\nhave already seen story filter or chart\nfilter or page filter where we are\napplying the filters on different charts\nand or the entire page uh in our\nprevious videos however when we say\nabout the linked analysis uh uh that\nmeans whenever we do any interaction\nsuppose we are doing interaction on this\nchart as drilled down on this chart then\nthis chart is getting filtered out or\nwhat it is just drilled out but this\ninteraction is not impacting any other\ncomponent or any other chart in this\nstory so this is an interact ction we\ncan make use of linked analysis\nfunctionality where we can uh implement\nthis interactions whatever the\ninteractions we are doing on this chart\ncan affect the data of other charts uh\nwe can do for all the charts all the\ncomponents of the chart page or we can\ndo for a specific chart as well so let's\nsee how to do this now uh when we say\nlinked analysis so I'm just selecting\nthis chart so on this chart suppose I'm\ndoing some\ninteractions then I wanted to affect the\nother all the components of these\ncharts so to do this uh you can go to\nthis options here uh where you have more\naction option here you can select linked\nanalysis once you selected uh then it\nshows interactions applied to only this\nwidget or all widgets in the story so\nfor now I'm just selecting all wigets in\nthe story uh we can um me if there are\nmultiple Pages the pages I'm saying this\nis one page then there is other pages\nalso we can add and uh this is also\npossible means all the pages that means\nall wigets in the story all wigets on\nthis page only this page but not to\nother page or only selected wigets so\nfor now let's see means I'm just\nselecting all wigets in the story and\nI'm selecting apply and when we say uh\nview now I'm going to interact with this\nuh uh chart which I have just applied\nthe linked analysis when I say uh linked\nanalysis I uh I clicking on here I'm\njust drilling down on this chart so you\ncan see the all the points all the\nvisits on this story has been affected\nand it is showing net sales revenue how\nmuch net sales revenue for this\nparticular um product then this line\nchart has also um reflected this\nparticular U bullet chart has been also\nchanged this particular uh chart has\nbeen also changed and basically if this\nuh this this is something uh which is uh\ndifferent chart which is not uh feasible\nto display that's why it is showing that\nno data is available for that this way\nwe can uh do it now let's go back and\nlet's try to apply uh this interactions\nlinked analysis to only to specific\num visit now let's say all visit on this\npage so that is that will affect only\nselected V vets then we can say uh we\ncan say automatically connect newly\ncreated filter data on on data point\nselection as well or we can say mean\ngross margin or gross margin percentage\nfor other so this is first one numeric\npoint chart let's say I'm wanted to add\nthis only to uh this um line chart which\nis gross margin per de and I'm just app\nplaying\nhere and when we view this we can see\nmeans uh now no other vets or no other\nchart should be affected only uh this\none uh so if I'm going toct uh going\nup going down you can see this this is\ngetting changed this line chart only no\nother component so you can see\neverything is uh the same way so when we\nwanted to interact with other uh\ncomponents so this is very useful\nfeature I I would say as a linked\nanalysis where uh one one chart can\naffect the other chart data to be\ndisplayed in a such a way that means it\nis useful for the business now the\nsecond point which I wanted to cover in\nthis video is about the data examine so\nsuppose I wanted to uh I wanted to\nexamine um this data so whatever the\ndata which is displaying on this chart I\nwanted to uh see where it's model data\nmeans what is the data behind that chart\nso we can do that just select this chart\nand there there is an option of examine\nin display when we select on this\nexamine you can see the data is getting\ndisplayed in a Excel spreadsheet kind of\nview where it shows uh the actual data\nin the database so Suppose there is\nsomething which is we wanted to validate\nwhether the data is displayed on the\ndata uh on the visualization stories\nwhether it is correct or not or it is\naccurate uh to that in the database\nmodels so that way we can do this\nexamine functionality when we wanted to\nhide we just click on this that's it\nfrom this video I hope you have\nunderstood these two points um in this\nvideo we will see analytic applications\none of the powerful feature again from\nsap analytics Cloud apart from storage\nor digital boardroom or visualization\nthis is one another component or feature\nwhich is available with sap Antics uh\nCloud that we will see some of the basic\nconcepts how to create that so what is\nsap antic application which is a\ndocument that can contain visualization\nsuch as tables charts uh and filters to\nallow navigation and Analysis of data so\nwhy what is difference of um antic\napplication than that of storage and all\nthose things so it can personalize the\nvisualization and interaction behaviors\nof the uh elements according to the user\nrequirement so there are some specific\nrequirements uh from the business so\nthat can be achieved using the antic\napplications only means we can write\nsome scripting applications some script\ncode various\num Event Event driven application uh\ncode as well that we can do it in uh\nthis antic application and these are\ncreated and consumed in sap Antics Cloud\nonly so how to create this so in sap\nAntics Cloud when we open this we have\nthis create analytic application option\nso apart from story Model you can say we\nhave another option of antic\napplications when we click on this uh we\nget in a screen where we can see\ndifferent different component available\nso we do have this different components\non the left side which says script\nvariable script objects we can have o\ndata services and there are so many\nthings which we can do uh and um that to\nbe in a scripting um code as well uh the\ndevice on on which device it can be seen\nthat Al we can specify it maybe laptop\niPod iPod Pro iPhone as well uh then\niPhone x as well so there are different\ndifferent devices which where this\napplication can be viewed and and\nsimilarly we can uh we can get an view\nof that particular uh application how it\nwill look into that there are some other\noptions where insert we can chart insert\ntables and there are different options\nlike drop- down filter list box\num checkpoint checkbox option list kind\nof things buttons there are various\ncomponents available we will be seeing\nthat practically uh how this uh can be\ndone this is very powerful I think means\nwhen we write something script or code\nuh to build different different\napplications so this would be very\nhelpful so we will see the this as well\nin this video we will learn about\nlinking two different models in the\nstory and how this two different models\ndata can be used to display the data on\nthe chart so we will see how to create a\nscatter plot chart based on two\ndifferent models use Link Dimensions\nfunctional functionality which where we\nwill will see different link type or\njoin types means how the data can be\njoined and then it can be used so now\nlet's see mean how we can create there\nis an option to uh link Dimensions where\nwe can see link Dimensions option here\nwhen we click on link\nDimension we will get an option to uh\ntwo select two models the first one is\nhere we can say I wanted to take plan\nevent sample model and then uh the next\none is B on juice so here we will see\nplan event sample is one thing which is\nwe are going to take a city and we join\nwith the location because both of the\ncolumns will have similar kind of data\nso you can see the sample here provided\nit it shows the data of the city names\nand in the location as well you can see\nhere on the best on choose model you can\nsee city names\nas if there are any errors between the\ndata then it will show up here means if\nthere are anything means the joints or\nthe linking is not Val then it can show\nup here we can add more Dimensions as\nwell to a link here we can select other\nand we can just drag it we can select\ndifferent uh Dimensions now once we are\ndone with this linking to Dimension just\nclick on set and then we can see means\nthis it will show up means from plan\nevent sample City the dimension and best\non use sample model location is the\ndimension just click on done once we are\ndone with this means we want wanted to\nsee how we can uh use this to display\nthe data in our charts to do this let's\nadd one chart in the story we will take\nuh a scatter plot chart just to see how\nmany events happen in a particular year\nand also sales uh net revenue as well uh\non the x-axis we will add measures from\num for now we just see the measures from\nplanned event sample and uh on y AIS we\nwanted to uh show the net sales revenue\nfor this for now on in this chart this\nis just only one Sam uh model which is\nplanned events add we wanted to add link\nmodel just click on this add link models\nand we do have best ju sample model\nwhich is already linked and you can see\nthis is joined already um so we uh\nwhatever the whatever the dimensions\njoin we can get it from this link D Link\nmodel on the AIS we wanted to add a net\nnet revenue net sales revenue so for\nthis you can see now it has appeared the\nnext model as well which is linked and\nwe can select net revenue from this\nmodel now we need a Dimensions or colors\non this as well because just adding\nmeasures will not work this catter plot\nneeds a dimension colors as well uh\nlet's let's use a planed event sample\nwhich we have created a link dimensions\non City so you can see it has a\ndifferent icon which says it's l linked\nwith the best R use sample model we can\nselect this now once we select this it\nwill appear like this where we can see\ndifferent different types of plots on\nthe on the scatter chart where it has\ndata based on the um on the on the y-\naxis it has a net revenue and on the\nxaxis is number of events for 2016 mean\nwhat are the uh events happen and what\nwhat is their revenues for that\nparticular event in that particular year\nso this kind of data we can get it from\nthe two uh linked model now uh when we\nsay linked model link Dimensions we need\nto see means how they are linked uh we\ncan uh see means there are two different\ntypes of Link types we can say when when\nwe click on this uh option here you can\nsee there is an option of Link type\nwhich says whether it is all primary\ndata or intersecting data only and there\nis an all data option as well so all\nprimary dat these are nothing but the\njoint types between the dimensions which\nwe are going to see so all primary data\nmeans it will take all data from the\nplanned event sample and it will also\nsay it will also take the matching data\nfrom the second uh model that means it's\nkind of leop join you can say uh all\ndata is disabled here as of now because\nthis is enabled only when we use Hana uh\ndata sources uh that time you can get\nthis uh this will this will give all the\nall the data from both the models and\nthen is intersecting data only that\nmeans whatever the data which is\nmatching there that it will take so we\nwill see both this how to use this and I\nwill see show you practically as well on\nthis uh there are the other options of\none link Dimensions options we can\ncreate new Mar members or we can merge\nmembers as well and this is showing\nactive link Dimension so for now City\nand location are active so if there are\nmany then we can get this as now let's\nsee how uh link Dimensions can give\ndifferent types of data based on the all\nprimary data or intersecting uh data\nonly that means uh just matching records\nor all all kind kinds of data so I'm\njust adding one chart here uh just to\nsee means how this affects the data\nWe'll add a link model as well which is\nhere plan event sample now uh I'll just\nselect uh this trend chart which is area\nchart I will select and I will add a\nmeasures the first measures I will add\nfrom the is net\nrevenue and another measure I will be\ngoing to add is about again the events\nfor that from the planned events model\nI'm going to add a dimension as well\nfrom the best R ju model which is a\nlocation uh just to see location wise\nSals revenue for and the events as well\nso now we can see means we do have the\nhierarchy enabled for this location now\nwe can see means the location and the\nsales revenue it is giving and the\nevents as well so we will just has\nhierarchy is enabled on this location we\nwill go on this uh with the um Next\nLevel and we will see is how this\naffects now you can see different types\nof uh locations available here or the\ncities available here uh where we can\nsay means there are two uh cities which\ndoes not have any data means this best\nrun juice sample is not having any data\nfor now me you can say uh so in the in\nthe best run so in the in the link\nDimensions when we say uh this is all\nprimary data link type is selected as\nall primary data that's why it is\nshowing like this where for now you\ndon't see any data for this particular\nor there is no events for this uh two\ncities which is uh because this orange\ndots are events and this blue are net R\nnet revenue so for this is not not\nhaving any uh data that means it doesn't\nhave any data in the second plan events\nmodel though that that's why it is still\nshowing because we have selected this as\na all all primary data now if it's just\nsay select intersection intersecting\ndata only that means whatever the data\nmatching between the two tables that\nwill appear and you can see those two\nrecords are not appearing or those two\nlocations are not appearing here\nwhatever the data which is matching mean\nif there is an event then if there is a\nrevenue then that's what means it is\nshowing up there for that particular\nlocation uh you will you will see there\nis no um location uh available so this\nis about uh that uh all primary data and\nintersecting intersecting data will give\nonly matching records between the two\nmodels and all primary data will give\nthe all the data from the left or the\nfirst primary model which is here and\nwhat are the matching from the second so\nthat kind of uh this um link Dimensions\nuh function to Works link Dimensions\nfunction to work in this video we will\nsee about predictive forecasting through\nuh Trend time series chart we will see\ndifferent types of forecasting uh how we\ncan Implement forecasting for the trend\nuh series charts based on the uh based\non the existing data there are different\ntypes of predictive forecasting as well\nof the algorithms which are there\navailable with the SSC that we can use\nto show out the predictive forecasting\nso let's get started let's add one uh\nchart in the tra uh Trend chart you can\nselect time Ser chart and from that once\nwe will just uh select uh the bed on uh\njuice sample model once we have added it\nwe can add measur let's say we will add\na measure uh we will create or we will\njust create one calculation which is net\nrevenue original price minus uh discount\nuh that is what the net sales revenue\nonce we have added this uh we need a\ndimension as well and for time series or\nchart it is always needed a date or time\nuh di menion you will not see any other\nlist as well from the model we need to\nselect this uh date uh once we can see\nthis how this is let's do some number\nformatting so that it will look\ngood so you can see this is what we do\nhave this time Trend series chart which\nis created uh you can see different\ndifferent values which is for the year\nmonth wise and so here we can select one\nmonth data as well uh 3 months data 6\nmonths year to uh data as well one year\nand all year as well this way we can uh\nwe can do this now let's say is we'll\njust see uh if you wanted to drill\nthrough different uh year or half year\nor month then we can do that as well uh\nright now it is on month-wise it is\nreally down so we can go up in the\ndrilling as well now to add forecasting\nuh we have this chart and we have the\noption to add option here and you can\nsee forecast option there are two three\noptions available here one is automatic\nforecast and the other one is some\nAdvanced forecasting which uses linear\nregression and triple expansion uh\nsmoothing and additional inputs now we\ncan let's let's first do uh automatic\nforecast when we click on this automatic\nforecast the forecast will generate for\nnext um 6 months again uh whatever the\nvalue we do have so whatever the so you\ncan see this is the forecast once we\nhave apply the forecast this link comes\non the top of this chart which says\nforecast and if it is green that means\nit is uh forecast is successful if it is\ngray then uh the the color is gray then\nforecast is low if it is the red red\ncolor then that means forecast is\nunsuccessful so we need to um see that\nas well and once we click on this link\nuh we can have this periods forecast\nperiods so for now this is 7 months\nforecast and if you wanted to reduce\nthat uh we can do that suppose we just\nwanted to see the forecast for next 4\nmonths that we can show up here you can\nsee this is a the dotted line is kind of\na forecast it is showing and um one once\nyou click on this it will show\nthe line how how it looks like so that\nit will be highlighting we can guess uh\nthe forecasting from here also you can\nsee and this is actually for forecast\nmeans what of this gray area which is\nhere which shows\num this maybe upper bound or lower bound\nvalues so now if you say that's what me\nit is showing here uh which is this\nforecast and this is with the automatic\nforecast message will use the data which\nis currently it is having the historical\ndata or the current data for the last 6\nmonths based on that it can uh predict\nnow let's do some other forecasting as\nwell uh and we're going to add another\nforecast which is\na Advan options which is there these are\ntwo algorithms we can say linear\nregression uh when we select linear\nregression it will just kind of some it\nwill show like this uh now see you can\nsee this is how it shows here when we uh\nsee this uh forecast you can see\nsomething which is it has changed and\nmay be possible that it will go in this\ndirection uh so it's lower lower bound\nand upper bound are the values which\nwhich chose up here uh similar to this\nas well it it is having again uh green\ngray and red color based on the forecast\nand by default we can uh select this uh\nwhatever 7 months are available there\nthis is a linear uh Recreation which\nwhich consider consist consist all the\ndata me all the previous historical data\nand then it will forecast based on that\nnow let's go to another which is We'll\nadd a exponential forecast triple\nexpanation smoothing is again another\nwhich is just taking the historical uh\nrange\nfor this you can see mean how this has\nbeen changed and this is just a based on\nthe current but it it just shows mean\nthis can be possible to go in this\ndirections as well uh so you can see the\nthe dotted line which is here that is\nkind of a reference line we can say\nwhich shows the predictive forecasting\nfor that particular um period and the S\nsame it is going uh the next directions\nand\nbased on that the actual values so\nactual values would be kind of this uh\nway maybe this way or maybe this way as\nwell it may be possible so we can\nconsider this this this would be the\nhighest or this would be the lowest\nvalues that we can uh consider as a\nforecast for this now the third type of\nforecasting is adding input control\nwhich is just available for time series\nchart which is add additional input so\nthe basically uh this is one option\nwhich is available add additional inputs\nwhere uh maybe there is some measures or\nsome other input controls or uh we can\ncreate and then it can influence the\nforecasting so suppose we do have some\nvalues which is um price or something\nwhich is if you same is fixed then it\ncan be for now this is not applicable\nbecause this price is not being\nconsidered because of the lack of future\nvalues but if you do have some values\nwhich is already available uh in any of\nthe major or any of the columns we can\ndo consider that as additional forecast\ninputs and then that can be utilized\nhere to predict the forecast to\nsummarize in this video we have learned\nabout uh three different types of um\nAdvance uh forecasting which is U linear\nregression then U triple exponential\nalgorithm and then adding input controls\nthese are three apart from the automatic\nforecast basically automatic forecast\nWorks basically on the available data\njust to predict the future values uh\nlinear regression will take into account\nwe should use linear regression\nalgorithm to use storical time series\ndata to predict the future values and we\nshould use the triple exponential\nalgorithm uh to see the seasonal changes\nor the time Trends uh for the forecast\nand lastly additional input controls is\njust using some of the measures of the\ncolumns from the model which can\ninfluence the prediction so it depends\nupon the data if there is available for\nthe implementation of the forecast so\nthese are the some of the um forecasting\nwhich we have seen in this video if you\nhave any question then please put it in\ncomment section this video we will learn\nabout analytical applications what is\nanalytical applications the theory\nsection I have already covered and the\nlink for that video is available in this\nuh video description you can go through\nuh it to understand uh what is analytic\napplications however in this video I'll\nbe going to cover about practically how\nto create analytical applications what\nare different components available with\nthe analytical applications uh basically\nanalytical applications are the same as\nuh stories but there are some major\ndifferences between the stories and uh\nanalytical applications so analytical\napplications here are some some of the\ndifferences which which tells about what\nis the difference between the stories\nand the analytical applications so\nanalytical applications are created by\nfew experts means there will be few\nexperts or developers who can create\nanalytical applications uh but that that\nuh stories or applications would be\nconsumed by many end users unlike T is\ncreated the other major difference is we\ncan configure the behavor of the UI\nelement user interface elements with the\nset of specific script API events and\nthen specify which action should take\nplace when events are triggered uh this\nuh is all about user interface me maybe\nuh some of the things which cannot be\nachievable with the with the uh story\ndesign but we can do with the antical\napplication so there are some customized\nrequirement from the business that can\nbe satisfied only through the antical\napplication that's why analytical\napplications came into picture and this\nuh flexibility can give us create\nvariety of an applications from a simple\nstatic dashboard to highly customized\napplications with uh numerous option\noptions to browse and navigate data\nthese are some of the major differences\nbetween the stories and the article\napplications uh we will see how to\ncreate the first thing is um analytical\napplications we can create it from here\nuh create analytical applications once\nonce we create analytical applications\nwhere we can see uh what we can do and\nwhat are the different things which are\navailable here uh similar to storage we\ndo have uh chart tables um\nand we can insert chart here uh whatever\nthe charts we we are having that we can\nuh create based on the these\napplications like we can create\ndifferent charts similar to the\nstorage however there are some other\nthings which are extra available here we\ncan see mean you can see this panel tab\nstrip uh text input field these are the\nmany things which is like drop down\ncheckbox grouping and these are some of\nthe components which are uh\navailable it's called at widgets and\nthis widgets are will be um available\nfor different different requirements and\nyou can see go map is also available\nclock RSS reader web page uh then bpc\nplanning sequence R visualization is\nagain a powerful um I'll be covering\nseparate videos on AR as well then um so\nthese are some of the things on the left\nside you can see canvas chart and then\npopups there are some script VAR script\nobjects bookmark set export to PDF uh so\nthere are so many things which we can\nhave it and we can create um the\nanalytical application as for our need\nso the only thing is about uh events and\ntriggers and the scripting so scripting\nis also one thing which we should be\nable to understand when whenever we say\nuh scripting every component will have\nwe can write script based on this like\non select or on result change where we\ncan write some uh scripting so this this\nscripting is nothing but a a JavaScript\nlanguage uh so JavaScript is a you can\nsay uh scripting language which is very\npopular and it is number one language we\ncan say for the web development and that\nis why it is uh being used as a common\nterm here I'll be going to take a\nseparate video on JavaScript as well\njust to uh give an overview of the\nJavaScript so that would be uh you can\nhelpful there are some other online\nresources as well available for Javas\nscript if you can learn from there as\nwell it would be helpful um then uh the\nother thing is about uh here uh we have\nsome chart scaling conditional\nformatting there are options various\noptions available we will be taking this\nuh separately in a separate video uh one\nby one what what all these um components\nare there like popups we can have popups\nuh I'll be taking a separate video on\nthe popups how it it can be useful uh to\ndisplay different different um popup\nmessages when we create an applications\nand we can so canvas is one thing where\nwe can see there are device in which\ndevice we wanted to see if you wanted to\nsee in a laptop uh then we can see or if\nyou wanted to show this in iPad then it\nwill come uh in this way just iPhone So\nbased on the size of the phone we we can\nget this option available here while the\ndesigning of the application so I think\nis from my perspective this is very\npowerful tool and if you know the\nscripting and if you know the components\nhow it they interact with each other and\nthen then we can build very powerful uh\nanalytical applications from this uh\nthere are very various things which we\ncan do and whatever the customized\nrequirement comes from the business it\nwill be helpful to create this such\npowerful applications uh based on this\nuh various components available\nI'll be taking one by one example for\neach on each of these uh components so\nthat it will be helpful so that's it\nfrom this uh video I I hope you have\nunderstood this if you have any\nquestions then please put it in comment\nsection if you have some specific\nrequirement where scripting can be\nuseful or you want to understand any\nspecific points related to the scripting\nor any other parts in the antical\napplication please do let me know in com\ncomment section I'll be happy to answer\nit in this video we will see about using\npopup Windows uh in analytic\napplications so this is one applications\nwhich I have developed and where I can\nsee is when we click on uh this uh\nselection a popup window gets open so\nsuppose we wanted to see the gross\nmargin uh in the tabular format we can\nuh get to see this in the popup window\nand when we select chart it can be\npossible to be displayed in the chart so\nthis can be possible with the scripting\nand uh I will be going to cover in this\nvideo the step by step how we can add\nthese components and then how we can\nwrite some scripts uh just to enable\nthis popups to be displayed there may be\nsome other requirements as well that we\ncan also do with this uh scripting so\nlet's get started first we will create\nuh analytical applications create\nanalytic application uh from the menu\nnow once we have this canvas gets open\nby default and we can have it uh let's\nget added some of the um chart initially\non this let's say here we are going to\nadd a sales revenue uh this is this is\none simple chart which I have added now\nand um I I can add some other uh check\nuh radio button we wanted to see either\ngraph graph display or we wanted to show\nin the TBL format so for this let's do\nthis radio button group option here now\nyou can see mean this is a option\navailable here means where we can give\nsome values so what are the text values\nso display in the chart format and the\nsecond will second one will be a t table\nformat and we can just apply the first\none is a default means this is the\ndefault selected if you wanted to select\nthis this we also we can display this as\nwell as a default U once we do this um\nnow let's try to run this when we we\nwanted to run this means we can see uh\nwe have added now two charts one is uh\nin the in the column chart and the other\nis line chart now what I we wanted to\nshow is we wanted to show a popup window\nwhere on on click of this chart we\nwanted to display another popup which\nwill display data in a chart format or\nin this table format now uh let's go\nback uh to the application now to do\nthis means what we wanted to do means\nlet's try to First add popups popups can\nbe added here from uh here just click on\nthis we can give some different name to\nthis popup uh one uh so pop is basically\na Windows window which has a header and\nfooter just click on this can give some\ninformation uh like gross\nmargin as this is what we wanted to\ndisplay on the window and okay and uh\ncancel are the two buttons which will be\nappear on the popup window at the bottom\nlike this there are some other\nproperties of emphasized enabled and\nvisible so both will be visible enable\nwill be both will be enabled if you want\nmiss any button we want to disabled that\nalso we can do it and we can enable it\nthrough scripting emphasize is means\nhighlighted one which is shown up\nhere now um now what we wanted to do me\non this radio button group we wanted to\ndisplay this popup which will uh will be\nuh having the chart so uh to do this\nfirst go to this popup and in this popup\nwe are going to add one um in popup one\nwill be displaying the data in the chart\nformat so let's do this in a chart\nformat now uh we wanted to see uh this\nis just add gross margin here now you\ncan see uh this is what we have added uh\nas a product and it's gross margin we\ncan give some name to this as well it is\ngross margin per product now once we\nhave added this um we can just save it\nand there is a scripting scripting is\none thing which is what we wanted to do\nwe can go to this scripting we wanted to\nenable this okay and cancel button\nscripting as well mean when on button of\nuh this click we wanted to close this uh\npopup close so when we do a DOT uh and\ncontrol space button you will get option\nof there are various functions\nassociated with it uh that particular\nwidget that it will be shown up now uh\nthis popup one will be having this now\nit it just created now what we wanted to\ndo is we wanted to open this popup when\nuh this value is CH so go to this edit\nscript and on select we do have an\noption of on select where uh when we\nclick on this so we will be checking\nfirst uh\nif radio button. get selected text this\nis one function means whatever the value\nis selected if it is equal to equal to\num chart then display popup one and that\nthat means we want to just open it let's\ntry to run this means how it works means\num we we see this as chart or table and\nwhen we click on chart you can see this\nchart is open me now we can click click\non okay but when we say table uh we are\nnot getting any popup window here we are\njust seeing it but but on chart we can\nget\nit now to do this on chart as well means\nwe will add another popup which uh which\nis again a TBL data here we will be\ngoing to add uh similar to what we have\ndone it earlier for this uh we'll add a\nmeasor cross margin we already added and\nwe are going to add some location this\nis something which we have uh going to\nadd it here and now this whatever the\nradio group functions on select function\nis written we can just write it else\nmeans if it is\nif the radio group is equal to equal to\nchart then we are going to display popup\none uh if it is not chart that means it\nis a value of table then we wanted to\ndisplay popup two now uh so this is what\nuh we wanted to do means now if you run\nit uh we we can uh see that it is\ngetting open now on the PO popup uh two\nas well we wanted to close it means\nwhenever uh user clicks on that button\nwhen we run this we should be able to\nsee um the T table data and the uh chart\ndata as you can see means now uh when um\nthis is the one which is there and uh\nsee on table as well we are getting the\ntable data which is\nhere and on chart as well we are getting\na chart type of data so all the\nfunctionality which is available here\nmeans we can see it we can drill down\nthrough it as well me to go in more\ndetail uh so similar to this mean there\nmay be some requirements where the such\ntype of scripting can be you uh required\nmeans where we can apply such scripting\nmeans from one event from One clicking\non this we can do this scripting on uh\nButton as well button click we can do it\non uh so there are buttons uh you can\nsee there are different different\ncomponents so we can do this on text\nclick as well uh we can just write uh\nthis text suppose we do have this text\nwhich is here and uh we can go to to\nthis and we can on click of this as well\nwe can open a popup another popup so\nlet's uh say Miss we can we want it to\ndisplay this this way also we can when\nuh the users click on particular text as\nwell we can uh open another window or\nanother popup so this is the US usage of\nthe popup Windows which is very useful\nwhen we have multi uh um like many\ndifferent stories and there are\ndifferent different components and\nSuppose there are some buttons which we\njust wanted to to show some of the\ninformation in a small window like a\npopup window then uh this type of\nWindows we can I use let's learn how to\ndisplay uh charts or table data based on\nthe scripting uh code uh Suppose there\nis an icon which says means I wanted to\ndisplay the T data in t tabular format\nand once clicked on this data will be\ndisplayed in the uh tabular format\nhowever when when clicked on\nchart icon the data will be displayed on\nthe uh in the chart format this is what\nwe wanted to uh do it and we can do with\nthis um with the use of the scripting uh\nso let's do do it how how we can do it\nnow what uh what first first step which\nuh is we need to add tables we need to\nadd tables and then um a chart based on\nuh on top of it me both of the tables\nand uh chart should be on the the same\nline so I have just added a chart from\nhere and the table from here and if you\ncan see how to align that so you can see\nthe margin from here means on the table\nyou can say the top margin would be\nlet's say means we do have 128 and\nsimilar to what chart will be also we\nwill set the same way uh you can see\nwhen we click on chart me it's almost uh\nsame or we can say it's so that both of\nthem will be aligned on same once we\nhave done this we need a icon to be\ndisplayed for that I have added a image\nto to add the image I have done this\nfrom adding image from here once we add\na image click on this image we'll get we\nit will ask for the image to be dis uh\ntaken from our local system or from the\nserver as well so and then we can uh\npaste add it here once we have uh done\nthis I have just rename it as switch to\ntable display is the one name and switch\nto chart display so just for um\nunderstanding purpose I have given the\nname now to switch actual switching when\nwe wanted to do is just go to the\nscripting of this uh so when we wanted\nto uh say uh chart display uh we we will\nwrite some scripting on this what we\nwanted to do is we wanted to when chart\ndata is displayed we wanted to display\nthe table table icon and we wanted to\nhide the tabular data but we wanted to\nuh\ndisplay the chart data now when we say\nwhen we say switch to chart display icon\nwhen we user clicks on the switch to\nchart display option we wanted to set\nchart as visible and table as invisible\nso we can say first chart one is set\nvisible and table one as set visible\nfalse so this is what we need and also\nwe wanted to display a a table display\nas true\nand um what mean that is the icon which\nis there and also chart as a false now\nthe similar thing we which we wanted to\ndo but in the opposite direction for the\nother icon as well so for this what we\ncan do we we can write uh this as\nfalse and this as true so on on table\ndisplay we wanted to display chart as\nmaking as chart as false visible and\ntable we wanted to display and also we\nwanted to hide the table icon but we\nwanted to display the chart\nicon this way we can do it on\ninitialization as well we wanted to\nwrite uh we we we just wanted to add\nchart one. set visible as false at the\nfirst place and both the charts we don't\nwant to be uh shown at the first place\nwhen the application is run let's run\nthis now you can see when it is\nrun it just shows the two icons which is\nTBL and chart when we click on chart the\nchart will be displayed and the chart\nicon will be invisible now when we\nwanted to display in the table format\njust click on this tabular format now\nthis data will come in table format and\nthe graph chart will be icon will be\ndisplayed here so this way we can switch\nlike this and this will work uh so this\nis what we wanted to uh we can do with\nthis uh application\nnow we can see this is the functions\nwhich we wanted to do is both the images\nthe script we write let's learn about\nplanning with SSC what is planning and\nwhat are the different different things\nwhich we can do with planning so very\nfirst thing is what is planning so\nplanning is all about setting strategic\ngoals for a business and then\ndetermining how to meet those goals by\ncreating annual budgets tracking\nprogress in forecast and simulating\nscenarios to find new opportunity uh so\nthere are three critical factors which\nwe should consider while using planning\nis one is budgets the other one is\nforecast and the scenarios predictive\nscenarios we can say which can be useful\nto set the goals and how we can uh\nachieve them three main phases we can\nsay ACT first is act means we can\nanalyze the information then predict and\nreport all kinds of information we can\nplan and analyze directly with the\nEnterprise solution for instant uh\ninsight to action\nand we can also visualize performance\nmetrics that comes in act act or action\nParts uh then we can once we have done\nall these analysis prediction and\nReporting and doing some performance\nmetric we need to collaborate\ncontinuously collaborate means we need\nto discuss plans interact on screen\ncrowdsource plans means whatever the\nplans are there we need to discuss or\ncollaborate with other business users or\nother business stakeholders who can\ncontribute to that plans so that it\nwould be um help to improve the plans\nand then finally we can become an\nintelligence Enterprise we can based on\nthe planning and the forecasting based\non the actual budgets we can become a\nintelligence Enterprise where we can\ndiscover top influencers we can augment\nmanual insights and ask questions to get\nanswers this is important uh in terms of\nplanning three things which is act\ncontinuously collaborate and become an\nintelligent Enterprise so that that way\nwe need to use planning for S now we can\nsay planning budgeting and forecasting\nas I said means this is the important\nthree important Concepts which is uh\nrelated to the planning the first one is\nplanning where uh we can uh provide the\noverall process for studying the\ndirection and the financial objective\nwhat is the possible means what are the\nthings which can be possible with the\ncurrent business or whatever the\nplanning there then we can based on that\nwe can prepare some strategic plans set\noverall goals and objective we we can\nhave long range plans as well me over uh\n3 to years or 10 years Horizon and\nannual plans as well first years for\nlong range plan so um three important\nthings strategic plans do some strategic\nplans then uh do some uh 3 to 10 years\nuh plan and review your annual plans\nyear on year that is what it is we can\ndo in planning so what is possible will\nbe considered in planning the next one\nis budgeting in budgeting we need to\nprovide the execution PA path for the\nplan means what is expected what are the\nthings which we can provide for the plan\nsales and growth margin budgets capital\nexpenditure budget head count budgets\noperating expenses budget budget means\nthere are different different parts or\ndifferent\ndifferent persons or areas in the uh\nbusiness which can be useful to see\nmeans what what what is the budget we\ncan allocate to that particular person\nso based on the actual work we can work\nout with this budgeting then forecasting\nis another third one is where we use\nactual performance data to project\nreminder of the current year performance\nso whatever the actual is happening like\nwhatever previously plan and what is it\nis doing at the moment in the business\nso based on that that data we can protu\nfor the next uh year or next 3 years or\nfive years how could be it could be so\nand if there are any Improvement then we\ncan do the improvements based on that\nforecasting so these are the three\nimportant um topics which are related to\nplanning budgeting forecasting for S\nStorage and where sap can help for\nEnterprise so any Enterprise means what\nwhat are the areas what are the main\nbusiness areas where SCP or SCP Antics\nCloud can help in terms of planning so\nthere are Finance sales marketing\noperations infotech work force so these\nare that covers most of the or all of\nthem all of the operations of any\nbusiness which we can say Finance is\nrelated to the financial planning sales\nis related to the sales team or sales uh\nhow sales is performing sales\nforecasting is also is done marketing it\ncan help to pricing the trade promotions\nproduct profitability loyality and many\nother things operations are also thing\nmean how the inventory is managed\nlogistic optimization warehouse\nmanagement demand planning then infotech\nthat means it uh resource ation cost\nallocations Network and Facilities\nWorkforce means what are the employees\nor how many employees how are required\nwhat are their performance how uh the\nbenefits of the staffs can be analyzed\nand uh their pension planning Healthcare\nplanning facilities planning so all\nthese can provide so these are the areas\nwhere sap can help for an Enterprise and\nsap analytics Cloud planning so this is\nvery powerful tool I I would say for sap\nuh which sap Has Come For sap Antics\ncloud and it will be a very uh demanding\nin future let's learn about some of the\nconcepts to the planning data model and\nhow to create that me there are some\ntheoretical Concepts which we are going\nto cons cover in this video creating\nplanning model because whenever we are\nwanted to do planning model and then we\nwanted to build some dashboards or\nstories then for planning related we\nneed to consider planning model so\nplanning model allows to do everything\nanalytic models do\nuh however they give more control with\nthe data such as setting up budgets and\nforecast so budgets and forecast are the\nimportant part apart from what\nanalytical models is doing all these\nthings can be done by planning model\nhowever there is additional setting\nbudgets and forecast which can create\nown versions of data model and copying\npasting data and using spreading or\nDistributing and allocating features so\nthis is important thing to understand\nwhat is planning model does me budget\nand forecast are important uh part which\nare additional to that analytical models\nplanning phases means how far into the\npast and how far into the future that is\nwhat we wanted to see me what are the\ntime settings that we need to specify\nmeans that is important means uh whether\nwe need to go for the next 3 years or\njust one year or just or five years or\nmore than that as well so that comes\nunder the settings for time so time\ncategory is very important to consider\nplanning phases and and in time as well\nyou can see granularity where year\nquarter month and day are we need to\ngive what are the different categories\nor standard categories available for\nplanning actual which comes as actual\nvalues budget will be how much is\nallowed to spend that means whatever the\nestimated budget for any business to run\nthere is some budget amounts decided by\nthe uh business management so that\namount will be uh specified in the\nbudget planning will be what is the goal\nwhat what is the goal mean how far you\nwant to go for next one year next three\nyear or next 5 years then what is\nforecast forecast is comes about the\nexpectations so what could be the\nexpectation of the financial data me\nbased on the actual data what could be\nthe forecast and rolling forecast will\nbe range of back and back or forward\nmean it can be forecast related to the\nforward or backward just for our\nanalysis purpose what is the difference\nbetween analytic model versus planning\nmodel in this we can see analytical\nmodel runs on live or imported data\nplanning model requires data to be\nacquired we cannot directly connect to\nthe live database or data source in the\nplanning model then in analytic model we\ndo not need category or time Dimensions\nhowever in planning model we do need\naccount category and time Dimensions\nwhich are required because that all\ndepends upon these categories only uh\nwhen we say planning no additional\ncategories required in antic model\nadditional categories May required or\nare required in the planning model\ncalculation of measures by formula uh\nand in planning model adjust or extend\nthe data by planning function so there\nare some planning functions which are\nused or which required so that comes in\nplanning model uh analytical model can\nuse can share the their dimension in\nplanning model we cannot use we need to\nuse a private versions and the last one\nis data loaded by scheding refresh or\nmapping however in planning model we\nneed to import or export data to SB\nstandard so these were the some of the\nconcepts to the planning model let's\nlearn about sap Antics Cloud predictive\nthere are some introductory Concepts\nabout sap Antics Cloud productive and\nhow we can utilize this for different\ndifferent things there are some\nimportant Concepts which are going to be\ncovered in this video the very first\nimportant topic is augmented analytics\nso augmented analytics is means it's a\nmore enhanced or more increased\nanalytics which uses machine learning\ntechnology for the antic process and\nwhat could it helps it can go from\ninsight to action within a fraction of\ntime within a fraction of time it can\ngenerate lot lot many different\ndifferent visualization or stories it\ncan avoid dat agenda driven or bias\ndecision making by revealing what drives\nthe business so what is the key factor\nwhat is the important factor which is\nrunning the business that we can\nconsider or which can be taken into\nconsideration and based on that it can\nprovide the different decisions there\nare three main functionalities which has\nprovided which is search to Insight\nsmart insight and smart Discovery so\nsearch to Insight which can quickly find\nway to answers that means user can type\nin English language some questions and\nthen it can the system will provide\nanswers effectively within fraction of\ntime then smart insights it can give\ninser instant explanations where uh it\ncan understand top contribut\ncontributors for specific data points\nwithout having to manually peot or slice\nand dice so there are many manual things\nwhich we do generally in the reporting\narea that can be avoided and it can\nautomatically create different charts in\nour P type of format which can easily um\nable to help to take the decisions for\nthe management users then smart\nDiscovery is another thing where you can\neasily reveal the insights identify key\ninfluencers and relationship in the data\nto discover how business factors\ninfluence performance we will be seeing\nall the thes practically how this works\nthis will be a very important topic to\nunderstand in this as well we need to\nunderstand predictive forecasting as\nwell we uh by using predictive\nforecasting we can get some early\nwarning system we can use multiple\nmathematical techniques such as data\nmining statistic machine learning and\nartificial intelligence so here in\ndiagram you can see how the predictive\nforecasting is given here for next few\nmonths uh or few years as well we can\ntake this predictive\nanalysis and how predictive analysis in\nstory can be I have already taken one\nvideo practically about this how\npredictive forecasting the link for that\nvideo you can find in the video\ndescription where you can see this um um\nforecasting we have done different\ndifferent types of forecasting as well\nwhich we have done automatic forecasting\nthere are some linear regression and\ntriple exponential smoothing algorithm\nas well that we you can uh\nconsider and when we wanted to build\ndifferent different calculations\npredictive calculation which can be used\nagain and again in different stories\nthen we can make a predictive model see\nhow to create a predictive model as well\nbecause this is important how to create\nmod predictive model we can create\ndifferent calculation type to get right\ndata about the usual data model we can\nuh use as the data source for a new\nstory once model is created that can be\nused to multiple stories we can have\naddition functional to create um the own\npredictive modation as well who consumes\npredictive model whenever we create a\npredictive model there are two\nstakeholders we can say data scientist\nand business user data scientist can\ncreate content with embed productive\nmodels using sap business objects\nPredictive Analytics and deploy them to\nsap business objects cloud while\nbusiness users can interact with the\npredictive contact and complex\nsimulation using filters and parameters\nthey can return the predict model in\nreal time allowing the data generation\nwith the support of generating scores\nprobability anest then zero code\ndeployment there is no need to deploy\nthe code means whatever the complicated\nstories or complicated predictive\nscenarios we are building there is no\ncoding required means for deployment it\nis just a seamless deployment from one\nsystem one environment to other so it\nwill not be going to be uh very\ndifficult and that that to be without\ncoding effort so business values what\nare the business values we can get we\ncan get everyone share their insights\nbusiness users make faster decision data\nsties control the business user\nexperience and it manage with the less\neffort that means cost\nsaving let's learn about smart assist we\nhave seen that what is augmented\nanalytics in our previous videos\ncontinuing to that means we will see\nwhat are different things which we can\ndo with the smart assist but what is\nSmart data discovery that is the one\ndefinition we wanted to see at the first\nplace uh it's smart Discovery is a Next\nGeneration data Discovery capability\nthat provides with business users or\ncitizens data scientists with insights\nfrom Advanced analytics business\nintelligence and analytics leaders\nshould plan for adoption as capabilities\nmature so this is very important to\nunderstand means about the data\nDiscovery because business intelligence\nand analytics things will be going in in\nthis Direction only going forward\nbecause data Discovery will be providing\ndifferent different capabilities to the\nbusiness users or the data scientist\nwhich can\ngenerate insights from uh different\ndifferent data which is actually having\nright now in the business in that way\nonly sap has come up with smart assist\nwhere there are different things which\nwhich we can do and that for this sap\nhas using machine learning\ntechnology which which covers about\nsearch to Insight smart Discovery smart\ninsights time series forecasting R\nvisualization also is important powerful\nthings smart grouping uh smart\ntransformation R visualization is\nsomething we can say it's related to the\ndata science\nso that's what me sap wanted to utilize\nand R is integrated with the sap Antics\nCloud as well where we can build\npowerful visualizations that can be\nuseful we will see this practically one\nby one each uh these uh\ntopics so what smart assist includes\nsmart assist includes smart Discovery\nsmart Insight smart grouping smart\ntransformation uh we will see this one\nby one so smart Discovery will be having\nall kpis core KP which which understand\nthe our main business drivers behind the\ncore kpis and based on that this kpis it\ncan be\nU for business it can give different\ndifferent decisions making data which\nwill be helpful for them to be make the\ndata so it can uncover key influencers\nof KPS by using classification and\nregation techniques interact with the\ninsights and explore hidden structures\nand relationship can find the answers to\nbusiness questions through initiative\ncharts and natural language natural\nlanguage that means users can write\ntheir questions in English language and\nthen the tool sap anti SC Cloud tool can\ncome up with the different visualization\nwithin fraction of time that that's a\npower powerful capability of s Antics\nCloud second point is smart insights\nwhich can develops clear understanding\nof intricate aspects of the business\ndata based on suppose we have created\none column chart or vpsa numeric chart\nor VPI created any other chart like line\nchart or go map based on the that if you\ncan say add smart insights based on the\ndata it can give some uh information in\nterms of English language what are the\ntop contributors for that particular uh\nparticular business or what what what\nwhat is the factor which is affecting\nthe revenue kind of those can give the\nexample here or the explanation that is\nsmart\ninsights smart grouping is we can use\nour technology which is are is an again\na data science language we can say which\ncan automatically create segments on\ndifferent types of data in the\norganization uh which can identify\ncustomer groups automatically in the\ndata and then can provide such type of\nvisualization which will be helpful for\nthe\nbusiness\nusers in this video we will learn about\nthe scripting and practically what is\nscripting and why scripting is needed in\nanalytics application or analytics\ndesign designer it is derived from\nJavaScript but what is the difference\nbetween JavaScript and analytics\ndesigner scripting so this is we are\ngoing to see scripting is very important\nin Antics application or analytics Cloud\nbecause when we wanted to build powerful\ncustomized Antics applications scripting\nis very important and we need to\nunderstand all the topics related to\nthat means so that means if you have\nknowledge on the JavaScript then\nanalytics designer scripting is very\nuseful if you don't have a knowledge on\nJavaScript then please try to learn uh\nJavaScript some some basic concepts then\nwe uh it it will be helpful for anex\nscripting in anex designer so what we\nare going to cover here is about\nJavaScript typing anex designer typing\ndata type conversion how data type\nconversions happen between different\ndifferent data types like number to\nstring string to uh number all the data\ntypes then what what are different Loops\navailable in antic designer like for\nLoops while Loops we will see this\npractically there is an additional Loops\navailable in Antics designer which is\nfor in that will also we will see double\nor triple operators in javascripts and\nanalytics designer that we are going to\nsee JavaScript switch statements how to\nuse in analytics designer and lastly we\nwill see script validation as well where\nhow script validation happens in\nJavaScript and how script validation\nhappens in the antic designer so all\nthese topics we'll be covering one by\none with the Practical example so please\nplease watch this video till the end so\nthat you will understand all these\ntopics which is very important in terms\nof scripting in Antics designer let's\nget\nstarted very first thing is about\nanalytics scripting mean why analytics\nscripting is needed when we create uh\nanalytics applications from here as we\nknow means we can write different\ndifferent scripts on the different\ncomponents script like you can say mean\nwhen we right click or when we C see\nthis we can see edit script on on this\nand we get in a screen of something\nwhich is called on select or so there\nare different widgets me you can write\nsome scripts on uh chart as well where\nuh we can uh select on select or on\nresult change uh events these are some\nof the different things which are\navailable and but and we can do some\ncustomization on analytics applications\nbased on the scripting so when we say\nscripting we need to understand first\nfrom where uh what type of programming\nlanguage is this me from where it comes\nbasically this Antics designer scripting\nis is a subset of JavaScript so as a\nJavaScript is one of the most powerful\nprogramming language in today's world uh\nwebsites or web applications where it it\nis used as a browser based language\nwhere um it uses in in combination with\nthe HTML and CSS so if you have\nknowledge on this JavaScript then you\ncan easily build powerful applications\nin scripting of analytics application if\nyou don't know JavaScript uh then you\ncan learn it from the web online web you\ncan just Google it for JavaScript and\nyou can get it some of the useful online\ntutorials and it is very easy to uh\nunderstand or learn anyone can do it and\nit it is very powerful language in\ntoday's word web but there are some\ndifferences between JavaScript and\nanalytics scripting that U we will see\nhere the very first\ndifference is Javascript is weekly type\nlanguage or dynamic type language there\nare two types of language however\nanalytics designer uh scripting is a\ncompletely Dynamic kind of um scripting\nlanguage we can say so first we need to\nunderstand what is weakly type and what\nis strongly type means so for this let's\ntry to write some uh script here what\nhappens in JavaScript is Java in\nJavaScript if you write this uh line\nlike if you're are declaring one\nvariable so this is where it's it's a\nvariable and end is variable name and we\nare assigning one value to this variable\nhow and when we try to print this with\nthe it's combination of this hello word\nmessage with the N variable so basically\nwe are um concatenating string with the\nnumber uh that that is type convergence\nso this this these two lines are valid\nin JavaScript but not in analytics\ndesigner we will see how to write the\nJavaScript script applications now let's\ngo to uh let's go to uh this is one of\nthe HTML page which I have created and I\ndo have uh script code is added here so\nwhenever we write any JavaScript code we\nwrite we can write it here now uh the\nsame lines if you just put it here uh it\nwill um paste it me if you just uh write\nit it will not give an any error but in\nanalytics designer it will give an error\nsaying that automatic type conversion is\nnot isn't supported type conversion\nmeans it is a conversion of number to\nstring or string to number so this is\nnot supported in anex designer so this\nis major difference but however in the\nJavaScript it can be supported means it\nwill not give any error now let's try to\nrun this so when uh I'm just ran this\nHTML file and I'm just uh have just\nclicked on this and you can see means\nyou can see this is a console where I'm\nprinting a message which is the first is\ntest matches which is just this test\nmatches which is getting printed but the\ntwo lines which is there variable length\nis equal to one that means string and\nnumber one is concatenated uh that means\nit is displayed means this is a weekly\ntype conversion that means it will\nautomatically uh decide means what type\nof runtime convergence happen uh so that\nthat is decided in JavaScript however in\nAntics applications it is not possible\nto uh work work out this we either need\nto convert it to string or number so\nbasically if you wanted to work it out\nhere we can just try uh select as two\nstring or to some other uh data type\nwhich is uh compatible with the hello\nword now you can see means here it will\nwork if you try to run this uh we will\nsee um in the console how it looks like\nnow when we I have written the script on\nthis uh button so when we click on this\nyou can see Hello word comma 1 is\ndisplay now in the an script so this is\na major difference whenever we wanted to\nhave a data type uh convergence we need\nto do it manually with these functions\navailable like two string or two fix\nkind of things uh however in JavaScript\nit will automatically uh do this so this\nis the first difference of automatic\ntype conversion or automatic type c we\nshould be able to understand now the\nnext point is about loops uh why Loops\nare needed and what are the different\ntypes of Loops available in sap antic\nscripting now in JavaScript there are\nfor Loop while loop is available similar\nto the this Loops uh in analytics\ndesigner also we can do for Loop and wi\nLoop now you can see in the JavaScript\nuh program we can we have write for I is\nequal to Zer that is that means I wanted\nto print this hello word hello message\nthree times uh when we wanted to do\niterative uh programming or iteration of\nsome some calculations of some of the\nthe function then we need this kind of\nLoops so for Loop is like this means we\nwanted to display multiple times this\nline so in this case when we wanted to\nsee this when we when we run this now\nwhen we click on this you can see uh\nhello for 0 1 2 3 three times this\nmessage has been printed if there are\nany other operations which we wanted to\nprint based on this trative values then\nwe can use this and now suppose we\nwanted to use similar kind of for Loop\nin our anex application then so let's\nsee whether it is working or not in anex\napplications we will come here and I\nwill just this will just comment out it\nnow now you can see when we type this it\nwill give an error something it is uh\nwhich says this is unknown variable it\ncould not identify what is this variable\nthat means we have to declare it\nmanually or just explicitly uh where it\nwe need to see this where variable that\nmeans this is variable um I is an\nvariable which is uh it would be uh it\nwould understand now you can see in this\nmessage as well this is not again means\nwe cannot use string with the number\nbecause the type conversion is not\nsupported so we have to use something\nwhich is true string similar to what we\nhave done this when we run this\napplication now we will we should be\nable to see the similar type of output\nwhich is in the JavaScript program now\nwhen we select any of these values you\ncan see this this is getting printed in\nthe console which is 0 one to the\nsimilar type of data so we need to\nunderstand this difference that we uh we\nneed we need to declare uh the variables\nlike\nthis and need to make the type converion\nas well with the functions available now\nthe next point is about the while loop\nwhile is again also alterative kind of\nLoops which is available similar to for\nLoop there are some differences now when\nwe we wanted to see um while loop as\nwell when we wanted to use it uh if you\njust wanted to give some\num range means still what time it what\nnumber or what range it should uh\niterate uh this is what we need to use\nand similar this is being used in\nJavaScript as well we can use the same\nthe only thing is means we need to\ndeclare variable in for the for Loop\nwhile loop as well similar to this we\nneed to use it let's comment out this\nnow and now if you just say now you can\nsay me it will start with one but less\nthan three means that will it should\ndisplay one time two times and with the\nincrement increment so this is one by\none it is incrementing now let's save it\nyou can see me when we select it it it\nis just displayed uh two times now if\nyou want it to display three times\nbecause n is declar as one and it is not\nzero if you declare zero and if you\nwanted to make it as four or then then\nit will be it will start with 1 2 3 so\nthis is how while Loops can be used now\nthe next point we will see about the\ndouble equal to operator and triple\nequal to operator and what how to use it\nalso we will see if then L statement as\nwell means how it has been used in this\nthis is one code which I have just\nwritten where I have declared n as a\nvariable which is having value one and I\nusing triple equal to sign here which is\nimportant to understand means when we\nwanted to use it when we wanted to\ncompare compare the value of this to\nthis then we can we should be using\ntriple equal to sign in the the in the\nanalytics scripting uh and if you run if\nyou try to run this application you will\ndo you will see mean this is working\nperfectly now you can see mean it it is\num n is equal to equal to one that's why\nit has displayed if statement here\nbecause that's what it is printed here\nsimilar code if you go in the JavaScript\nas well means you can see means this is\nnot the case means uh we can see means\nif you give equal to equal to operator\nas well it will\nwork and also if you give triple equal\nto sign as well then also it will work\nnow let's see me uh how this works you\ncan see this is also JavaScript program\nalso gives the same St statement now\nwhen we say just if you just in\nJavaScript you just give double equal to\nsign then it will\nit will decide on run time is what are\nthe types of these two variables like\ntwo values this and this whether if it\nis if this is number or and if this is a\nstring then it will automatically decide\non run time that is dynamically it it\nwill decide while the program is being\nexecuted I'm just doing it again and now\nalso you can see mean this is again\ngoing to give the same result now the\nsimilar thing if you do it in the Antics\napplications like instead of triple\nequal to sign we if you give just double\nequal to sign then it it will give an\nerror saying that this could lead to an\nunexpected beavor because of possible\nautotype conversion during runtime so\nduring runtime is when the application\nis run then it will decide me what are\nthe type conversion so suppose this is\nnumber and uh then uh this applic this\nvariable should be also number so it\nwill automatically convert it to number\nnow if I try to run this application now\nyou can see means when it is run means\nif I select this it will it will give a\ncorrect answer because it has on run\ntime it has been decided means which\ndata type is what the conversion has\nbeen happened on run time but this is\nthis is not this is not recommended\nmeans to use this double equal to\noperator when you wanted to use instead\nuse triple equal to so that the type\nconversion will happen before executing\nthe application so this is very uh uh\nimportant thing to remember whenever we\nwanted to use uh this operator\nbecause JavaScript is not that strongly\ntype language it it decides on the\nruntime and that's why it is sometimes\nit throws an exception but at uh while\napplication is run but in antic designer\nthis all validation is done before\nrunning the application and that's why\nwe should be using this triple equal to\noperator here while comparing any\nvalues now there are things which we can\ndo with the program flow as well means\nwhen we wanted to check one condition\nthen we wanted to display like this if\nif then else statement how it should be\nreturn so if one condition is satisfied\nthen do some calculation or do some\ndisplay some message then else if we can\nadd another condition we can do some\nother uh calculation or any other\nmessage to be displayed like this we can\ndo this if then L statement now in\nJavaScript there is another one which is\nswitch statement as well is there so\nthat switch statement is also in\nJavaScript we if you give this so this\nwill not give an error it will work\ncorrectly mean this is again program\nflow how how it happens like means if if\nthe case statement is now you can see\nmeans in JavaScript this is one\nstatement which is written here like\nmean if the value is one suppose we can\npass some values to this as well uh like\num let's say we have variable of one a\nas like four three or two let's say\nmeans and we are just passing to this a\nas here if a is equal to whatever the\nvalue a is having the particular case\nstatement will be executed so in this\ncase two is the value for a then in that\ncase this statement will execute so that\nthat is what means uh the switch\nstatement is to be done now same thing\nmeans if you do uh in analytics\nuh like this I'm just copying it here\nand we'll just try to write it\nhere now you can see it will not this we\nneed to declare it so when we copy this\nwe can see this is what mean so for this\nwe need to just declare this as where\nbecause it will not work it needs to be\nidentified it is a strongly type\nscripting language gentics designer we\nneed to explicitly specify the variables\nfor that particular like we identifier\nfor that particular variables the\nsimilar way means we need to do this in\nantic scripting application and the last\npoint which is there is about um\nvalidation means how the validation\nhappens basically in Antics designer uh\nwe uh the validation or the very syntax\nchecking or any errors that all kind of\ndata validation or syntactical error\nvalidation is done before running the\napplications suppose now you can see\nmeans since I haven't given it here um\nit will immediately say that it is\ngiving an uh it is not correct I mean\njust specify the correct Ed data type\nhere while JavaScript is not like that\nin JavaScript suppose I'm just making\nsome mistake here it will not throw an\nerror now that is not the case in the\nJavaScript suppose this is one code\nwhich I have written and I'm just making\none change instead of this nth variable\nI am just making uh mean I'm just\nchanging its variable name is something\nto like this now and when I'm trying to\nrun basically it should give an error\nhere itself that this variable is not\ndeclar anywhere about this but this this\nPro JavaScript doesn't give that type of\nerrors but it will be validating at the\nrun time is suppose we are giving an uh\nmean we are just trying to run this and\njust click on this you can see this\nmeans this is given an exception at run\ntime mean this n is not undefined not\ndefined so this is what means it's a\ndifference between the antic designer\nand an JavaScript JavaScript doeses the\ndata validation at runtime or program\nvalidation at run time while antic\ndesigner does the validation before\nrunning the applications so this this\nthis is something which is major\ndifference we can say and uh this way it\nwill prevent any unsecure data to go on\nweb when we are using Antics it is\nbetter to catch the errors before um\ngoing over the websites or any other\napplications when we are putting it in\nbrowser so that way this anex\napplications is useful or I think means\nit is good that it is sap has come up\nwith this uh options to have this\nvalidation done before before running\nthe applications that's it from this uh\nvideo I hope you have understood I have\ntried to cover most of the things uh\nabout the scripting the scripting is\nimportant to consider I'll be taking\nsome more examples on the scripting on\ndifferent different our widgets which\nare available uh if you have any\nquestions or comments or suggestions\nplease do let me know in comment section\nin this video we will see about filter\ning the table based on the drop down\nselection uh you can see this is one of\nthe application which I have created if\nyou select any of the measures from this\nuh the corresponding table gets\npopulated with that particular measure\nlike if I just wanted to display\noriginal sales price for that particular\nuh table we can get this original sales\nprice in this video basically we will\nsee how to add drop- down and then how\nto add these major values to the drop\ndown and also see how to filter out this\ndata let's create first an application\nanalytic application where we will uh\ncreate first one uh table simple table\nand then we will add a drop down box as\nwell I'm selecting this model which is\nbest on juice model sample model\navailable here now you can see means it\nis already populated with the account\ndimensions and gross margin now we\nwanted to have a drop- down which will\npopulate different different measures\nwhat so different different measures\nmeans whatever the measures which are\navailable here in this particular model\nnow what we will do we will add one drop\ndown first in this from uh here we can\nadd a drop down box once drop down is\nadded we can add we will add one text\nbox as well here just to the text text\nbox as well we will add it here which\nwill say selected measures now you can\nsee right now when we run this\napplication we will not see any of the\nthings in the top down it will just uh\nhave whatever it is there as a table and\nin drop down will not be populated uh in\nin it we wanted to add some uh drop-\ndown values first in this so This that\nis the first thing for this we will\ncreate one script variable from here for\nthis script variable we will give name\nlike current measure selection because\nthis is what means we can give any name\nbut for now means we will see mean just\nto identify correctly we will say\ncurrent major filter SE is selection and\nwe will give default value because we uh\nwhen when application is run we wanted\nto see its default value something which\nis gross margin because this is the\nmeasure which is getting displayed at\nthe first\nplace so to display cross margin at the\nyou can write like this uh which is this\nis a model name and then its parent ID\nand gross margin if you write like this\nmeans it will come like um gross margin\nand the drop down but now we have just\ncreated this fi uh script variable which\nwe will be creating and then it will act\nas a global variable we can use anywhere\nin this uh applications now to load this\napplication means first thing we we we\nneed to initialize the drop down with\nthe different different values like\ngross margin sales revenue like discount\ndifferent different measures to do this\non the canvas of this canvas screen we\nneed to write edit script and on\ninitialization means when the\napplication is first run we need to\npopulate all the measures at the first\nplace to do that means we need to add\nsome scripting first try to get all the\nmeasures from the tables mean whatever\nthe table we will give uh rename this\ntable to table so that it will be easy\nuh to identify on on initialization of\nthis uh script we will we will get the\ntable do get data source so this is one\nof the measures we are going to create\nand get data source get measures so what\nwhat this will be doing it will take all\nthe measures we can just try try to\nprint this as well in the console me\njust to for our testing purpose here we\ncan uh print that this measures is the\nvariable which we we are where in that\nwe are trying to get all the measures of\nthis particular table so table is having\nassociated with the data source which is\nthe based on juice model and all the\nmeasures which are associated that with\nthat we are getting to that let's see is\nhow this works in the now when we try to\nprint this in console we can see this\nthis is the what it is printing here uh\nwhat what all all these things which are\ndimensions like you can see it here when\nwe we wanted to print this you can see\nthis means all the measures which are\nall available in that account based\nonore sold model that all are coming\nlike this uh which is having description\ngross margin discount original sales\nprice and all these things so basically\nthis is these are the IDS and these are\nthe descriptions so basically in drop\ndown we wanted to display description to\ndo that let's go back in our\napplications and we need to write some\nscript\nhere now what we have done here mean do\nlike selected key is one variable which\nis taken as blank and we we are checking\nmeasures. length is greater than zero\nmeans what is this measures measures is\nnothing but these measures which are\ngetting all the measur from the model uh\nwe we are going to Loop these conditions\nlike for Loop we are applying where we\nwanted to drop down do measures do add\nitem so in the drop down measure so we\nhave the drop down which is here in the\nin that drop down measure we we are\ngoing to add add do item do add item and\nmeasures of I do ID comma measures of I\ndo description so what this will do in\nthis uh drop down it will add the\nparticular measures description uh for\nthat particular data source and what\nthis code will do like if selected key\nis equal to equal blank means whatever\nthe value is selected which is coming as\nfirst as suppose it is getting gross\nmargin then it will be displaying that\nassigning that value to this selected\nkey and lastly we will see um we will\nset drop down measures do set selected\nkey as selected key so whatever the\nvalues which is selected here that will\nbe assigned to that particular drop-\ndown measure so this is what it should\nwe should be doing to add the measures\nfrom the data source now let's try to\nrun this now you can see means by\ndefault this value has has been come as\ngross margin for this drop down as\nselected because we have given that drop\ndefault value in that particular\nvariable and then you can see different\ndifferent values like measures value\nwhich are come here Discount sales price\nprice quantity sold now if you select\nany of the measures it will not affect\nthis table because we haven't written\nany to work on this filtering of the dis\ntable we will work on that now now uh to\ndo this we need script objects means we\nneed need to create one function which\nwill do this um filtering of the data\nmeans whatever the value which is\nselected here in this drop down it\nshould be passing to that particular uh\ntable as a set Dimension filter now we\nwill do this uh we will add one function\nfor this when we add any function we get\nan folder created here and we can rename\nthis as well let's say me I'm just it\nisun name I'm giving we we'll rename\nthis as well set measure filter because\nthis is what we wanted to we we will say\nreturn type we don't want to return type\nwe need one argument because the what\nare the value which is we are passing\nfrom drop- down to uh table filter that\nvalue we will be passing this to uh this\nfield function so for that we will add\none argument here that argument we will\ngive name it as selected ID type will be\nstring because we are passing string\nfrom the drop down so that data type\nwill be string only now we have done\nthis now we need to write some script on\nthis uh filter function so that it will\nbe possible to filter out here uh this\nscript which is table. gate data source.\nremove Dimension filter because whatever\nwhen at the first place application is\nrun the table is displaying gross margin\nat the first place we wanted to remove\nthat Dimension filter so we will remove\nthat and then the next one we what we\nare going to do is whatever the values\nwhich are getting in the function set\nselected ID uh we'll be doing it table\ndoget data source. set Dimension filter\nand this is the model name and then\nselected ID to select selected ID is the\nargument which is getting passed now\nthis is the function and when we run\nthis application it will not work right\nnow as well we need to do one more extra\nstep for that what we will do we we will\ngo to this drop down measures and on\nselect of this script we need to call\nthis function fun which we have\nwritten we will write the functions\nwhich we have just written which is set\nmeasure and we will pass the value of\nthe dropdown which is we are going to\nselect for this we will select\ndropdown do get selected uh key so\nwhatever the value which we are uh\npassing to the drop down that will be\npassed to set measure filter now uh in\nthis set measure filter once this it\nwill come in this function of argument\nand then it will be set to that\nparticular table as a dimension filter\nso this is how it will work now let's\ntry to run this now we can see initially\nit is a gross margin if you select some\nother measures from here you can see\nmeans this gets populated with this\noriginal sales price so this is\nsomething which is we we can do with\nthis filtering of the drop down we can\ndo similarly to this chart as well by\nchart filtering as well from the drop\ndown as well we will we can do multiple\nselections on the drop down measures as\nwell so we will see that in next videos\nso in this video we will see a scripting\ndifference between analytics cloud and\nLuma designer or designer Studio M we\nall know that there is a scripting uh\navailable in Luma designer and design\nstudio and there is a scripting\navailable in analytics Cloud as well but\nwhat is the difference between theage\nthis is important to understand mean\nthere are some uh basic differences uh\nin this uh scripting\nyeah this is uh some of the differences\nlisted here the first one is lumira\nscripts executed on the server me what\nare the scripts which is we are writing\nin the Luma that executes on the Luma\nserver we can say however in ARX Cloud\nthese scripts executes in the browser of\nJavaScript engine that is uh it Lumas\nscripts executes close to the data\nhowever Antics designer scripts execut\nexecutes close to the\nuser and in lum is data sources are not\nhidden or not bound to any widgets I\nmean what wigets are like the drop down\ntable or charts kind of widgets it is\nnot associated with that but here it is\ncurrently HED and within data and must\nbe accessed through G data source so\nthis is one function which we need to\nuse to get the data and then once it is\navailable then it can be used as a\nglobal variables to use in different\ndifferent stories or\napplications there is one major\ndifference is of Auto IC type conversion\nof the data\ntypes in Lum designer double equals\noperator has been used for comparison\noperator while in Antics Cloud it\ndoesn't support this antic type\nconversion but which avoids common\nmistake and which me before before\nrunning the application only it can be\num check it checks the compatibility of\nthe comparison operators or the data\ntypes so it is it is include strict\nequality comparison operator so triple\nequal to operator is the main we need to\nuse whenever we wanted to compare both\ntwo variables or two data\ntypes so these are some of the basic\ndifferences between the lra designer on\ndesign studio and analytics\ncloud in this video we will see about\nsearch to Insight one of the powerful\nfeature of augmented analytics in\nanalytics Cloud we will see how to apply\nthis search to Insight in our\napplication uh now this is one\napplication which we already have and I\nhave just created one button which is\njust I have given the text name to show\nsearch to Insight so search search to\nInsight is uh one functionality where we\ncan give our queries in natural English\nlanguage and the tool automatically can\ncome up with different different charts\nand crafts uh on the\napplications now let's to do this means\nthere is a search to Insight option\navailable here where uh we can create\nsearch to Insight uh or we can go\nthrough this and then uh we will write\nsome script where we will\nsay uh mode one of the variable we are\ngoing to declare then search to inside\ndialog mode so this is one of the in\nbuil component we can say for search to\nInsight and this is the view uh there\nare two modes actually for such two\nInsight one is simple and one is\nAdvanced so we can decide mean so\nsuppose some some of the users are more\nadvanced then they they can have the\nadvanced view of this search site while\nthe end users can just have simple\nsearch to Insight now after we create\nmode here then we can write search to\nInsight one. open dialog basically uh\nwhen we when we write this so search to\nInsight is one function uh component\nwhich we already added here uh search to\nInsite from here we can add it and then\nfor that if we say we have open dialogue\nthere are some other options as well we\ncan say apply apply search to chart or\nclose dialogue get variables open\ndialogue set variable value for now we\nwill say open dialogue and then we have\nso we need to specify some\num like um questions so here let's say\nis we wanted to say gross margin by\nlocation and then next one is the mode\nso already we have selected the mode\nmaybe it's simple or Advanced or then we\nneed to mention whether to clear the\nsearch means whenever user is coming one\nuser is coming he is doing some search\nand on the search to site so that that\nhistory is we can clear it for that we\ncan use true and then Auto search means\nautomatic search we can make it as true\nbecause it would be helpful for the\nindividuals to get the next questions\nnow uh let's try to run this now when we\nclick on this right now means when we\nclick on this you can see means the\nsearch to Insite options will be\navailable you can see the question is\ncome here and the chart has been already\ncome here automatically so this is not\nInu we have created or anything it\nautomatically uh came now there are\nother options recommendation for new\nsearch as well me we can get product\nsold by product this is also we can get\nso these are the some things which are\navailable and we can we can exit search\nto Insight from here or we can just\ndelete all these search results and we\ncan again start uh basically uh we can\ntype some other questions as well like\nthis it is search now uh this is a\nsimple mode and now we will see what is\nadvanced mode uh now advanced mode is\none thing which is\nhere if you just select advance advance\nnow let's means what is the difference\non this now when we click on this show\nsearch to inside here you can see when\nwe say advanced mode there is show some\ndetails like model is been s shown here\nuh bed on use sample model this is one\nmodel it has been because it has been\nshown and if you click on this it will\nshow up all the measures and dimension\nwhen the users like some of the users\nare like more advanced who can\nunderstand the models and their measures\nand dimensions as well they can select\nsee this and then they can get some\nreports from here let's say they want to\nsee the discount that is also they can\nget now see you can see gross margin\nplus discount it is showing here uh\nwhich is uh on on each of these things\nso this can be customized mean based on\nthe users requirement now in this we\nhave just given the static question here\nwe can give some other Dynamic question\nas well we can add some input Dynamic\ninput put text as well U for this let's\ncreate a input field here which which\nwill give some value here where it will\nsay enter text or enter your question\nhere means we can type here once we have\nthis we can just um pass this question\nto this search to Insight option now\nlet's create on this um here so as this\nis a static question we we can we can\nget this static question from here for\nthis we can get where question is uh one\nof the variable we will create and then\nwe will say input field do get\nvalue this value we will see and this\nquestion we will pass it here rest of\nthe options we will keep the same now\nwhen we run this you can see this uh\nthis question suppose I wanted to uh\ntype some question here that gross\nmargin by location and I'm I'll just\nclick on this search show search to\ninside now it will automatically come\nfor that particular if I just wanted to\nuh add some more conditions like I\nwanted to buy so this is what uh it this\nis what it is to be uh implemented like\nthis search toite is one thing where we\ncan add one or more data models to it\nwhen we say this we can add one more\ndata model and then that would be\navailable over there suppose we wanted\nto have this as well we can just\ndo this as well you can see uh the\ndifference show gross margin it is\nshowing like this uh it shows two data\nmodels now for this so this is the way\nme suppose we do have multiple data\nmodels then we can assign that data\nmodels to search to Insite and the users\ncan make uh the use of it to get uh\ninstant uh reports graphical reports on\nthis uh we can export this as a CSP from\nhere as well mean if you want and then\nuh\nthat can be utilized for the next\npurpose so that's it from this search to\nInsight component of the augmented\nanalytics let's learn some of the\nadministrative task about sap antic\nCloud where we in this video we will see\ndefining users teams roles and security\nthis is a theory Concepts where I will\nbe going to tell you about what all\nthings which we need to consider while\nwe uh understand the administration and\nusers and security the very first thing\nis uh when when we say about any\nbusiness we should be uh considering\nusers who are going to use so if there\nare different types of users then teams\nthen roles and security so sap antic\nCloud uses sap Cloud identity as the\ndefault authentication method and single\nSI non authentication is also available\nwhere it can identify provider can be\ncompared using SML 2.0 protocol SCP\nantic Cloud provides basic user\nmanagement including creating deleting\nand changing and role assignment we can\nalso import user data from CFC file for\nactive directory and if you want to\nsynchronize users with other systems or\nmaintain users in the batch\nmode we can have user management create\ndelete change and search where you can\nsee this is one of the screenshot which\nsays displays different different users\nwith their first name last name and then\nthe display name they have email ID and\nall their roles as well so roles are\nimportant to understand means who can be\nadmin who can be end user who can be the\ndevelopers who can be just uh bi admin\nkind of things what are their licenses\nas well which can be spr there so it all\ncomes on under the security and users\nuser role uh creation and approval role\ncreation which can request roles uh\nsuppose someone wanted to Grant some\naccess for some of the modification of\nthe stories or some other changes to\ntheir access they can request loads all\ndefault roles will be selected and can\nbe deselected if you are requesting\ndefault roles a user can select which\nSelf Service role to request user can\nenter comment for on approver so when\nuser regist a request he can or he or\nshe can provide some comments to the\napprover and request notification will\nbe sent to the approver upon completion\nof the\ndialogue there are some other functions\nwhere password creation or reset\npassword is also means it's a basic\nthings which we need for admin admin\nperson this this is important then he\ncan do role management different types\nof role uh creation deletion of the\nroles and assigning roles rights what\nare the Rights created create delete\nread read uh access rights that is also\nimportant execute who can execute who\ncannot execute who can maintain that\nkind of uh rights also it can be\nprovided by the Admin\nperson let's learn how to uh perform\nAdministration task this is a theory\nConcepts which is related to the\nadministrative task where I'll be going\nto cover different things let's say\nfirst Administration task first is\nDefine data access in model basically\nwhenever we create any models so who can\naccess that particular model who can see\nwhat level of details that can be\nassigned on the model what are the model\nprivacy set when the it is created it\nneeds to be have the role include data\naccess levels as well so this is\nimportant to set the privacy of any\nmodels because there may be model\ndifferent different models which you may\nnot be wanted to see some different\nusers so in the business it can be\npossible there are different different\ntypes of users and their data access\nlevel should be different so in that\nperspective we need to set our prior\nprivacy for the\nmodels so that can be done from this\nprivacy settings for that particular uh\nmodel where if it is on then we can see\nme or can give different different\naccesses as this\nthen Rite for property in dimension it\ncan apply to all models that use these\nDimension One model can have more than\none data Access Control enabled\nDimension access defined in the on\nhierarchy node will be propagated to its\ndescendant but will be over written if\nanother access if defined on a lower\nlevel node it can right include read\naccess right control of the publication\nand right access is only for\nplanning access management this is one\nscreenshot it shows how to do the access\nmanagement and how the data is shown in\nthe report you can see what is the read\nwrite permission so for these particular\nDimensions measures there is some who\ncan read so these are some of the users\nname given those only can see otherwise\nthey cannot see it in the\nreport and they don't have any right\npermission as well so this can be set\nspecified for this uh users and you can\nsee how this report data can be is shown\nhere which is just a read it cannot be\nedited kind of\nMoree model bra based privacy settings\nas well we can assign filters to be\ndefined on any property of the dimension\nin the model whenever we create any\nDimension you can see here there is an\noption where it can specify the uh\nfilters for that particular\nDimension there are different\npermissions which we need to consider\nfull access read access update access\ndelete access new documents new folder\nfull access means it they can do\neverything read access they can just\nread it update means they can update the\nmodel delete means they can delete the\nmodel uh new documents mean they can\ncreate new documents or new folders as\nwell they are able to create so these\nare options available where it can you\ncan see here if they are checked then\nthat means they have the access other if\nyou don't want to give the access then\nit can be not the next one is teams in\nuh s so in team is a group of users so a\nuser can belong to multiple teams if a\nrole is assigned to a team then all\nmembers of the team can inherit that\nrole each team has a team folder which\ncan only be accessed by the users in\nthat team so team is very important uh\nthere may be uh if you create one team\nwhich is of same kind of users Suppose\nthere are 10 users who are who need same\nkind of access then we can create a team\nof that particular 10 users and then\nassign access to that particular team\nonly so that all the accesses which has\ngiven to that team that will be\ninherited to the users and that team so\nthis is very useful so better to create\na team whenever for the common types of\nusers how to create team there is there\nis a security and then teams and once\nthe teams screen is open there is an\noption to create a team here and then we\ncan create team and then we can add\nmembers from here where we can search\nfor different different members and can\nadd it\nhere what are the best practices for\nassigning roles to teams uh we can\nassign users to teams we can assign\nroles to teams as well so this is\nimportant when we assign users to teams\nand assign roles to teams that means\nwhat are the roles which is assigned to\nthat particular team that will be\nassigned to that particular users in\nthat particular team so this is useful\nto manage or maintain later when we\nwanted to add or remove any of the users\nfrom a particular team that would be\nuseful to do that what is the content\ndeployment guidelines when we deploy\nanything means from one one one model we\nwanted to deploy to other\nsystems then what are the guidelines so\nas antic Cloud supports easy export and\nimport of content to and from file mean\nit is a very easy export we don't need\nto be writing any code for deployment\nit's just easy things if there are a\ndependencies between the content the\ndependent content is automatically\nselected unless it is a location\nDimension if you have your enrichment in\nyour model basically what are the\ndependencies uh it can be automatically\nselected point of Interest data is not\nexported point of interest is another\ncomponent in the S which is not exported\nexported only public content can be\nexported you cannot import old exports\ninto newer touns so this is important to\nunderstand mean about the old versions\nand the new\nversions content deployment uh when we\ndo content it's just a simple deployment\noption is there in the menu of the\nsantic cloud and Export we can export\nthen we can decide what type of things\nwhich we need to export So Stories what\nare the in the public folder which which\nis there that can be only deployed to\nother\nthings there are some audit logs as well\nwhich which is useful to trace the logs\nof the particular file so whenever we\nwanted to see different different locks\nof of a particular uh deployment things\nwhich we are doing that kind of locks\nwill be uh tore in these lock\nfiles then lastly we can see system\nusages which type of which model is\ntaking more time or which which has\ntaken more uh usage or memory of this\nthat that can be displayed in the in\nthis screen where uh you can see some of\nthe models has more memory like you can\nsay 17 MB or something some of the very\nslow small very small that can be\ndisplayed it here and some of them are\nvery\nsmall it is useful for the performance\nperspective where we can see which model\nis taking more memory when we wanted to\nuh improve the performance of the system\nin this video we will see about some of\nthe administrative features which is in\nthe sap Antics Cloud uh we will see how\nto create users how to assign roles to\ndifferent users how to create teams uh\nthen how we will see some of the\nadministrative performance of the models\nuh system usage and all those things\npractically to do this means you can go\nto this uh uh menu and you can see\nsecurity and security we have users team\nroles request data changes and all those\nthings let's see is what are the\ndifferent users available here now when\nwe say users there are different\ndifferent users and when we can create\nour own users a new users suppose we\nwanted to give access to some other\nusers as a new user then we can do that\nby clicking on this new users and we can\nsee that uh create a new user uh this is\nlet's say 1 2 3 this is one of the user\nID and we can say uh this is a test uh\nuser as so we can give that and uh we\ncan we need to give the email ID as well\nbecause that is what we needed it\nuh let's say this is one of the email ID\nuh then manager if you have anything\nmean then we can give the manager's name\nhere mean it would be uh useful for when\nwe wanted to approve uh the request for\nthe access uh we can give roles so roles\nis important thing is what type of user\nit will be will it be these are the\ndifferent different roles which is\nhaving like you can see application\ncreated which is having analytics\ndesigner access bi admin will have\nadministrative P full privileges uh then\nthere are bi content creator uh bi\ncontent viewer only then PR predictive\nadmin predictive content created and we\ncan create our own U role as well which\nis here I have created so we can give\nthat as well and we can just say that I\nwanted to make it as a developer this\nway we can do it and then we can uh save\nit so this is this is the way but we\nwill see how to create roles now so when\nwe say users instead of users we can\ncreate a different teams and in teams we\ncan say we we can add different users\nteams are required means when we have\nsimilar kind of users who are uh who are\nsuppose developers or just R bi content\ncreated then we can create some similar\ngroups suppose we wanted to have we have\nend users who are just going to view the\nstories for them we can just create a a\ngroup or team and then uh in that team\nwe can add all the end users who just\nview the storage say create one the uh\nthing and we can add some users from\nhere and then just uh click team uh the\nmain usage of the team is just when we\ncreate a team whenever we wanted to give\nan access to or the roles to the\nparticular users then it is better to\ngive in the team uh so that it would be\nuh useful me and it will save the time\nas it now when the other option is roles\nroles are important means what type of\nuh users so depending upon the users\nusers role or users function\nfunctionality or what what type of work\nthey can do we we can create uh the\nroles so basically there are like here\nyou can say there are\nsix roles already available as has given\nfirst one is application um designer\nprivilege and suppose we wanted to\nassign any users in that we can create\nit assign that with the help of this\nmeans you can see these are the access\nfor each of the each of this role me you\ncan see uh different different name here\nand you can say create read update\ndelete execute these are the different\noptions available and based on this we\ncan see me see suppose what type of\nusers fall in this particular category\nso that that we can uh give it here now\nonce we create teams there are and roles\nuh so we will see other roles as well\nhere the admin is having administrative\nprivilege full privileges uh content\ncreated create and update privileges uh\nviewer is just having read privileges\npredictive admin will be having having\nfull privileges then predictive content\ncreator so predictive admin is more of\nrelated to the predictive models I think\nme and then predictive content creator\nas well predictive models and stories\ncustom roles we can create our own new\nrole mean instead of let's see how how\nto create it we can give some test Ro\nname and license type business\nintelligence if you have any other like\nplanning then we can create that as well\nand then uh out of this we need to\nchoose what type of roles mean suppose\nout of this only we we need to select\nbut if you wanted to give some something\nspecial uh then we can give it uh\nselecting blank and then means we can\ngive so here we can say that this user\nwill be having access to only anti\nmodels uh he can create read and update\nmodels but he cannot delete the models\nso this is also option uh we can give\nand he cannot maintain\nso such type of things there are many\nthings currency planning model then kpi\nrole you can say data change log life\ncycle so it depends on all the\nrequirement and when the users are being\ncreated and what type of users they are\nbased on their business role or business\nfunctionality they are doing we need to\nassign this and we can assign the users\nfrom here as well assign users to this\nparticular\nuh role suppose we we have uh we have\nthis assign roles we can we can just\ngive this to particular this um team\nwhich is\nthere now the other thing is about uh\nrequest so this is also important to um\nsame is if there are any new role\nrequest suppose you are admin person who\nare looking after all the users access\nand roles creation the other end users\nor the other business users can request\nsome roles so they can their request can\nbe seen it here and mean then once you\ncan select then you can approve it and\nthen can grant access on this then there\nis deployment is also possible mean this\nis also very simple mean suppose we\nwanted to deploy anything means anything\nwe can uh make it as a export and then\nwe can add it here suppose we wanted to\nadd something which is uh like exporting\nlike Dimensions or connections or\nanything this so we can uh select\nthis and then means or any specific\nthing me we you wanted to uh remove then\nwe can uh remove it and then click on\nexport now once export Suppose there are\nsome other things like UT as well means\nfrom other users you you have got\nsomething then you can uh import it from\nU there as well mean by giving some uh\nfiles and then last one is about the\nsystem performance or system things\nwhich which is there where we can see\ndifferent different system usage who are\nusing the systems and what are the\ndifferent active users you can see\nhistorical usage uh so how much is the\nusage for this um you can see one month\n3 month 6 month year to date as well\nsuppose you just wanted to see one month\nthen we can see we we wanted to see for\nall we can see that as well so this is\nthe number of active users and these are\nnumber of logins so who how\nhow many logins are done so if there are\nmany users then we can see means how the\nsystem is performing and it is useful uh\nat that time then system uses by storage\nas well means how much storage the\nmodels or storage are taking so you can\nsee used by model so these are the\nmodels size you can see 8.42 MB is the\nmaximum here so all of them are like\nthis and then system storage uses by\nuser so if there are hundreds of users\nand we wanted to see the performance of\nthe system then we can do this by by the\nhelp of this\nsuppose some particular user is\nconsuming more memory then we can look\ninto that as\nwell system users usage by user tracing\nthis is a\nlock uh log of this systems so whatever\nit is\nin this video we will see various data\nwrangling features in the model when we\nacquire the data and when we try to\ncreate the data means we can manipulate\nour data based on our requirement there\nmay be some type of data which which is\nnot in the correct format we wanted to\nsplit some columns we wanted to extract\nsome data then that type of functions or\noperations we can perform on the data so\nI have created uh just this model I have\njust imported one Excel file uh in the\nin while creating the model and we will\nsee how what are the different so when\nwe get this model we can see when when\nwe click on this any of the options any\nof the columns uh we can see um there is\nan options uh we um we can either\nreplace some value with some other but\nthere is another option which is create\ntransform where we can see concatenate\nsplit extract replace and change so when\nwe say concatenate means we we can\nconcate two columns suppose we wanted to\ncreate one a separate column which says\nstate and city I wanted to concatenate\nand we wanted to put some uh for put\nsome character in between those so that\nwe can do with this type of so you can\nsee me another column which is got\ncreated here and which say state and\ncity and state name is has been\nconcatenated and you can see me there\nare different\naddresses like phone number or Street\nnumber State these will be storing in\nthe separate separate column then that\nthat columns we can combine in a single\ncolumn so that for that we can use this\nconcate options then uh we can see some\nother transforms as well where we can\nsee split so suppose we wanted to split\nsomething which is uh we can say that we\nwanted we have some uh qu data which is\ncoming in a concatenated way in in the\nin the data then we can split this\ncolumn with with the help of some\ncharacters so we can split with this D\nlimiter which which is a comma in this\ncolumn we wanted to split with this uh\nSt and if you wanted to repeat like\nmeans suppose this is repeat one two\nmeans we wanted to repeat three means\nwanted to create four Suppose there are\nfour commas four values which is there\nwhich is separated by comma then we can\nsee like this now suppose I will show\nyou how this works now suppose we I have\nanother value which is here I wanted to\nreplace this with value with with this\none n and I'm some other\ncountry and some number so this is what\nI'm going to replace now uh you can see\nme this values has been replaced with\nthis and now we wanted to apply the\ntransform function which which will\nsplit based on this\ncolumn comma operator now we can say\nsplit with the help of comma you can see\nfirst\nuh first word before the comma comes in\nthe second and if you wanted to apply in\nmultiple columns like uh let's say means\nwe have three or let's say two then\nsecond will come after this like here\nyou can see mean three if you say three\nthen test country and 1 2 3 has been\nsplitted out like this we we can see\nthis has been applied here so this way\nwe can split out this column values\nwhich which can be extracted and we can\nput it in a separate columns as well so\nthis is this is also can be a\nrequirement where we need to do this\nlet's see the other options which is\nextract so now if you have some um some\ncolumns which you just wanted to extract\nsome value the other feature is about\nextract where we can extract suppose we\nwanted to extract uh after space from\nState one after first occurrence of\nwhere we can say extract number or\nextract\nword after or we can give some other\noperators here after before between\ncontaining equal to First occurrence\nfirst or last occurrence of space now we\nwanted to split for the space then we\ncan do this you can see means once we do\nthis you can see after the first space\nor after the first occurrence of the\nspace space whatever the word it is\nthere we can get it we can make it\nas before as well means before the space\nas well we can extra the word and\nSuppose there is no word then we can get\nthis as well so this is what we can do\nit now uh the other transform is about\nreplace replace is just we wanted to\nreplace something so replace matching\nvalue Suppose there is a blank value\nwhich you wanted to replace with\nsomething which is saying as null if\nthere is a space then we can replace\nwith the null values like this now the\nother one is change so this is also just\na change of upper case to lower case we\ncan make it as lower case or upper case\nor title case as well so this is also\nuseful when we wanted to present our\ndata in a formatted way we can do this\nthese are the some of the transform now\nthere are other options as well here\nwhich says remove duplicates as well\nSuppose there are duplicate rows then we\ncan duplicate this rows as well if there\nare any duplicate rows so it will show\nup what are the duplicate rows has been\nthere so this these are the some of the\noptions which are available so these are\nthe some of the options available um for\nthe transformation of the data wrangling\nand this is useful when we have large\nnumber of data and which comes in a\ndifferent formatted ways and we wanted\nto have some specific type of data for\nour story build so that's it from this\nvideo I hope you you have understood\nthis if you have any question then\nplease uh do let me know in comment\nsection if you like my video then please\nlike it and subscribe to my channel as\nwell thank you for watching in this\nvideo we will see about creating\nhierarchies in the model and how to use\nthis hierar hierarchies in the stories\nthat we are going to use so let's try to\ncreate one model uh first where we will\nbe selecting one uh Excel file I'm just\nimporting this Excel file which is\nhaving some sales related data and we\nwill be creating a hierarchy on product\nand category so there are two columns\nwhich we think means on in a\nrelationship like parent child kind of\nrelationship they are having and we will\nbe creating hierarchies based on that\nand then we will use this so once we\nhave C imported this Excel file now we\ncan see there are different types of\ndata here available and you when when we\nsay there are product and category these\nare the two columns so there are some\nproducts which falls under some category\nand that we can have a parent child\nrelationship or hierarchies when we just\nselect this column and then to create a\nhierarchy click click on this add\nDimension attribute once you say this we\ncan mention this parent child hierarchy\nand we can once we click select that we\ncan select the parent means what is the\nparent of this particular column so we\ndo have category which is the parent for\nthis column\nyou can see it\nhere once we select this you can see the\nicon of this column has been change\nwhich says hierarchy this way we can\ncreate hierarchy there is a this is a\nparent child hierarchy we can create\nlevel based High hierarchy as well like\nyou can say country State uh city as\nwell which uh which we we can have like\nstate city or store uh this kind of uh\nrelationship also we can uh build it\nonce we create this hierarchy we will\njust create this model and by just\nclicking on this create\nmodel now once uh we have created this\nmodel we will just access that model to\ncreate to create the story and we will\nselect that\nmodel and we will go to uh see in the\nstory how it works so now if you say me\nI just uh created this story and will\njust add one uh one chart\nwhich says take the horizontal like\ncolumn bar chart which is there and uh\nwhich says we we just want you to see\nthe gross margin and\ndiscount and we will just add the\ndimension as well for this\nhere which we are going to add is this\nproduct because that is what we wanted\nto select now if you if you see this\nproduct now if you just click on this\nyou can get an feature of drilling\nDrilling L on this which is available\nhere we can go through drill down to the\nnext product like you can see the first\nit will appear as a category so this is\nuh three different categories which are\nthere and we can go uh through this here\nuh as a drill down or we can just click\non this hierarchy icon here and we can\nsay that go to Next Level this way we\ncan uh see the how hierarchies are\nworking and this is useful when we\nwanted to build uh\ndrill drill down or drill up kind of\ndata means to explore the possibilities\nof the data in the OR analysis of the\ndata in terms of displaying the data in\ndifferent different visualization charts\nthis way we can use these hierarchies in\nthe analytics Cloud I hope this will be\nhelpful for you if you have any\nquestions then please put it in comment\nsection if you like my video then please\nlike it and subscribe to my channel as\nwell thank you for watching\n",
