  "text": "Thanks to Wix for supporting PBS Digital Studios.\nHey, I’m Jabril and welcome to Crash Course\nAI!\nSo far in this series, we’ve focused on\nartificial intelligence that uses Supervised\nLearning.\nThese programs need a teacher to use labeled\ndata to tell them “right” from “wrong.”\nAnd we humans have places where supervised\nlearning happens, like classrooms with teachers,\nbut that’s not the only way we learn.\nWe can also learn lots of things on our own\nby finding patterns in the world.\nWe can look at dogs and elephants and know\nthey’re different animals without anyone\ntelling us.\nOr we can even figure out the rules of a sport\njust by watching people play.\nThis kind of learning without a teacher is\ncalled Unsupervised Learning and, in some\ncases, computers can do it too.\nINTRO\nThe key difference between supervised and\nunsupervised learning is what we’re trying\nto predict.\nIn supervised learning, we’re trying to\nbuild a model to predict an answer or label\nprovided by a teacher.\nIn unsupervised learning, instead of a teacher,\nthe world around us is basically providing\ntraining labels.\nFor example, if I freeze this video of a tennis\nball RIGHT NOW, can you draw what could be\nthe next frame?\nUnsupervised learning is about modeling the\nworld by guessing like this, and it’s useful\nbecause we don’t need labels provided by\na teacher.\nBabies do a lot of unsupervised learning by\nwatching and imitating people, and we’d\nlike computers to be able to learn like this as well.\nThis lets us utilize lots of freely available\ndata in the world or on the internet.\nIn many cases, one of the easiest ways to\nunderstand how AI can use unsupervised learning\nis by doing it ourselves, so let’s look\nat a few photos of flowers with no labels.\nThe most basic way to model the world is to\nassume that it’s made up of distinct groups\nof objects that share properties.\nSo, for example, how many types of flowers\nare here?\nWe could say there are two because there are\ntwo colors, purple and yellow.\nOr we could look at the petal shapes, and\ndivide them into round petals and tall vertical ones.\nOr maybe we have some more experience with\nflowers and realize that two of these are\ntulips, one is a sunflower, and one is a daisy,\nso there are three categories.\nImmediately recognizing different properties\nlike this and creating categories is called\nunsupervised clustering.\nWe don’t have labels provided by a teacher,\nbut we do have a key assumption about the\nworld that we’re modeling: certain objects\nare more similar to each other than others.\nWe can program computers to perform clustering\ntoo.\nBut to do that, we need to choose a few properties\nof flowers we’re interested in looking at,\nlike how we picked color or shape just now.\nFor a more realistic example, let’s say\nI bought a packet of iris seeds to plant in\nmy garden.\nAfter the flowers bloom though, it looks like\nthere were several species of irises mixed\nup in that one packet.\nNow I’m no expert gardener, but I can use\nsome AI to help me analyze my garden.\nTo construct a model, we have to answer two\nkey questions.\nFirst, what observations can we measure?\nAll of these flowers are purple, so that’s\nprobably not the best way to tell them apart.\nBut different irises seem to have different\npetal lengths and widths, which we can measure\nand place on this graph with petal length\non the Y axis and width on the X axis.\nAnd second, how do we want to represent the\nworld?\nWe’re going to stick to a very simple assumption\nhere: there are clusters in our data.\nSpecifically, we’re going to say there are\nsome number of groups called K clusters, but\nwe don’t know where they are.\nTo help us, we’re going to use the K-means\nclustering algorithm.\nK-means clustering is a simple algorithm.\nAll it needs is a way to compare observations,\na way to guess how many clusters exist in\nthe data, and a way to calculate averages\nfor each cluster it predicts.\nIn particular, we want to calculate the mean\nby adding up all data points in a cluster\nand dividing by the total number of points.\nRemember, unsupervised learning is about modeling\nthe world, so our algorithm will have two\nsteps:\nFirst, our AI will predict.\nWhat does the model expect the world to look\nlike?\nIn other words, which flowers should be clustered\ntogether because they’re the same species?\nSecond, our AI will correct or learn.\nThe model will update its beliefs to agree\nwith its observation of the world.\nTo start the process, we have to specify how\nmany clusters the model should look for.\nI’m guessing there are three clusters in\nthe data, so that becomes the model’s initial\nunderstanding of the world, and we’re looking\nfor K=3 averages, or three types of irises.\nBut to start, our model doesn’t really know\nanything, so the averages are random and so\nare its predictions.\nEach datapoint (which is a flower) is given\na label as type1, type2, or type3, based on\nthe algorithm’s beliefs.\nNext, our model tries to correct itself.\nThe average of each cluster of datapoints\nshould be in the middle, so the model corrects\nitself by calculating new averages.\nWe can see those averages here, marked with\nXs, which gives our updated model of the three\n(or so we guessed) types of irises.\nThe graph is still pretty noisy.\nFor example, it’s a little weird that there\nare type2 flowers so close to the average\nfor type3.\nBut we did start with a random model, so\nwe can’t expect too much accuracy.\nLogically, we know that irises of the same\nspecies tend to have similar petals, so those\ndatapoints should be clustered together.\nSince we just did a correction or learning\nstep, we can repeat the process, starting\nwith a new prediction step.\nLet’s predict new labels using the Xs that\nmark the averages of each label.\nWe’ll give every datapoint the label of\nits closest X -- type1, type2, or type3 -- and\nthen we’ll calculate new averages.\nThat’s better, but still not the cleanest\nclusters, so we can repeat the process again:\nPredict, Learn, Predict, Learn.\nEventually, the Xs will stop moving and we\nhave a model of iris clusters created with\nunsupervised learning!\nNow the ultimate question is, did we find\nmeaningful patterns about the world with our\nAI?\nWe made an assumption that there were three\ntypes of irises, and we assumed that they\nhave different petal lengths and widths.\nWas this true?\nLucky for us, I have a friend who is a master\ngardener.\nI showed him the real-life flowers closest\nto each of the three averages and he said\nthat type1 is Versicolor, type2 is Setosa\nand type3 is Virginica.\nThree different iris species!\nWe learned about the world from observation,\nwhich is what makes this unsupervised learning,\neven though we relied a tiny bit on a teacher(the master gardener) for confirmation and help.\nNow that we’ve learned the basics, we can\nexperiment with harder examples.\nLet’s say we want to use an unsupervised\nlearning algorithm to sort a bunch of different\nphotos, not just three iris species.\nFirst, what observations can we measure?\nHow much green there is?\nWhether there’s a nose and fur?\nTo have a computer make these observations,\nwe need to measure thousands of red, green,\nand blue pixels in each image.\nSecond, how do we want to represent the world?\nBefore, we were only working with 2 features,\nso we could just use averages of the clustered\ndatapoints and get meaningful abstraction\nfrom it.\nBut when dealing with images, we can’t use\nthe same method, because we won’t get much\nmeaning out of averaging colored pixels for\nwhat we want to accomplish.\nSomehow, we need the model to create a representation\nthat tells us if two images are similar.\nThere are meaningful patterns in the data\nthat are more abstract than individual pixels,\nand finding them across many images is called\nRepresentation Learning.\nThese patterns help us understand what’s\nin the images and how to compare them to each\nother.\nRepresentation learning happens both in supervised\nand unsupervised learning models, so we can\ndo it with or without labels to find patterns\nin the world.\nTo understand the basic idea of representation\nlearning, check out this experiment: I’m\ngonna look at a picture really fast and then\ntry to draw it.\nReady, Set, Go!\nWoah. That was 5 seconds?\nMy eyes took in the picture and remembered\nimportant features, so I’m building a representation\nin my mind.\nBut I can’t just show you my thoughts to\nget feedback on what parts I misremembered,\nso I have to produce a reconstruction, or\ndraw the original image from memory.\nAlright, so this is what I’ve got.\nNow let’s compare my drawing to the original image.\nLet's see round plate, triangle slice of pizza, some cheese, some crust, tablecloth. Pretty good.\nFor an AI, making a reconstruction would mean\nproducing all the right pixel values to make\na reconstruction.\nOur K-means clustering algorithm from before,\npredicted classes for flowers based on how\nclose the datapoints were to the averages.\nFor images, we will have learned image representations\ninstead of averages.\nAfter that step, just like before, the AI\nwill have to correct itself.\nPreviously, we updated the K clusters based\non how well our predicted labels fit the data.\nBut for images, we’d have to update the\nmodel’s /internal representations/ based\non its reconstructions.\nThere are different ways to use unsupervised\nlearning in combination with representation\nlearning so that an AI can compare images.\nLike, for example, there’s a type of neural\nnetwork called an autoencoder, which uses\nthe same basic principles of weights and biases\nto process inputs, pass data onto hidden neuron\nlayers, and finally to a prediction output\nlayer.\nIf John-Green-bot was programmed with an autoencoder, the input would be an image, the hidden layers\nwould contain representations, and the output\nwould be a full reconstruction of the original\nimage (which gets more accurate the more we\ntrain his AI).\nTheoretically, I could give John-Green-bot\na representation of a pizza and he could reconstruct\nthe original pizza image.\nWhat’s so powerful about unsupervised learning\nis that the world is our teacher.\nBy looking around, taking in a lot of data,\nand predicting what we’ll see and hear next,\nwe learn about how the world works and how\nit should be represented.\nWhen asked how AI will fulfill its grand ambitions,\n2018\nTuring Award Winner Professor Yann LeCun,\nsaid: “We all know that unsupervised learning\nis the ultimate answer.“\nSo I guess we better keep working on it!\nUnsupervised learning is a huge area of active\nresearch.\nThe human brain is specially designed for\nthis kind of learning and has different parts\nfor vision, language, movement, and so on.\nThese structures and what kinds of patterns\nour brains look for were developed over billions\nof years of evolution.\nBut it’s really tricky to build an AI that\ndoes unsupervised learning well because AI\nsystems can’t learn exactly like human often\ndo, just by watching and imitating.\nSomeone, like us, has to design the models\nand tell them how to look for patterns before\nletting them loose.\nNext time, we’ll look at applying similar\nconcepts to AI systems that find patterns\nin words and language, in what’s called\nNatural Language Processing.\nSee you then!\nThanks to Wix for supporting PBS Digital Studios.\nCheckout Wix.com if you’re looking to make\nyour own website.\nWix is a platform that allows you to build\na personalized website for almost any purpose\nfrom promoting your business or creating an\nonline shop to a place for you to test out\nnew ideas.\nTheir technology allows you to create something\nunique no matter your skill level with templates\nand all in one management.\nIf you’d like to check it out you can go\nto wix.com/go/crashcourse\nOr click the link in the description.\nCrash Course AI is produced in association with PBS Digital Studios.\nIf you want to help keep Crash Course\nfree for everyone, forever, you can join our\ncommunity on Patreon.\nAnd if you want to learn more about the math\nof k-means clustering, check out this video\nfrom Crash Course Statistics.\n",
