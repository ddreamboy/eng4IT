  "text": "happy\ncoding hey there and welcome to the next\nvideo in our series of intro to webdev\num right now we are sort of in the\nmiddle of learning about libraries and\nin the last video we learned about\nloading a library in your um HTML file\nand then using the functions that the\nlibrary offers in your JavaScript um and\nin this video I am excited because now I\nget to talk about my favorite JavaScript\nlibrary and that is a library called\np5.js um so yeah I'm going to walk\nthrough it and uh sort of introduce uh\nthe library itself and then sort of show\nyou uh how to use it and uh all that\ngood stuff so let's see so first off um\nI want to maybe just introduce a a\nconcept um it's not a huge deal but it's\nthe fact that like creative coding is a\nthing um so if I just type creative\ncoding into my search\nengine I see a bunch of results and um\nyou know you can click through them to\nlearn more but essentially this is the\nidea that you can use code to be\ncreative and hopefully by now that's not\na surprise to you because a lot of what\nwe've been learning about um is all\nabout creativity and finding ways to\nexpress yourself and and do stuff that's\ninteresting to you um but this is a\npretty broad category that ranges from\neverything from like um like digital art\nto uh things like special effects in\nmovies to uh like if you've ever been to\na Conor and there's like a Trippy like\nbackground uh that's all written using\nCode um\nand so there's this idea that you can\nwrite code that helps you be creative\nand there's a bunch of ways to do it and\nin fact this Wikipedia article um has a\nfew libraries that um are in a bunch of\ndifferent languages and the one that we\nare going to focus on is\np5.js um the other way that you might\nfind p5.js is I don't know if you were\njust typed like creative coding\nJavaScript library into a search engine\nand you'll get a bunch of results and I\nI've never played with\nand just like any other JavaScript\nlibrary the first kinds of things I'm\nlooking at well first off you know I'm\nlooking at their homepage and stuff\nwhich they actually updated since the\nlast time I saw it so this might get\ninteresting cuz I'm not sure if I'm\ngoing to know exactly where to go um but\nthe idea is that you're reading through\nyou're learning more about the uh\nLibrary just on their homepage and then\nwhat you're looking for is some\ndocumentation around how to use that uh\nlibrary and a a URL to load the library\nin the first place so let's see um I see\ndownload p5.js I see donate um so sure\nlet's go to download and I'm either\nlooking for a file that I can download\nand looks like I can do that if I want\nto um or I'm looking for a URL like this\num so this is a URL that I can use and\nload that directly into my index.html\nfile um so let's uh yeah let's do that\num so I have a glitch project here it's\njust sort of a bare bones uh I haven't\ntouched anything yet uh project in\nglitch and let's load the JavaScript\nlibrary so I'm going to use a script tag\nand I'm going to say Source equals and\nthen I'm going to paste in what I just\ntook from the p5js uh web\npage and then I'm going to close it out\nand close out my tag okay so now I have\nloaded the\np5.js library in my index. HTML file and\nI can now start to use it I haven't\nactually done that yet um but I can do\nthat and so what I would do if I wasn't\nwatching this video is to learn more\nabout p5js uh first off there's a bunch\nof like tutorials that you can uh work\nthrough um there's a reference that\ngives you a big old list of here's all\nof the functions that P5 gives you um\nthe other place you can go is happy\ncoding. my little web page and there are\na bunch of p5.js tutorials um on there\nso you can click through here and some\nof this will be um kind of review for\nyou um since you have already been\ncoding in JavaScript but um this is a\ngood way to sort of introduce yourself\nto like the things you can do in the\nlibrary so you can do sort of like\nvisual uh things and here's a bunch of\nlike example projects that I've put\ntogether um exploring different concepts\nin in p5js\num but I think because I am you know the\none recording the video I guess I will\njust sort of show you how I would start\na p5.js\nproject so the first thing I'll do is\nI'll go back to my um my glitch project\nhere and again so far the only thing\nI've really done is load the JavaScript\nlibrary load the P5 Library so the next\nthing I'll do is uh I'll create a a\nscript.js file of my own um this is\nwhere my code will go you can call this\nwhatever you want um often uh folks who\nare coding in P5 call this sketch. JS\nbecause you're usually like creating\nsome kind of sketch but it's really up\nto you that's just one convention you\ncan call it unicorn. JS if you really\nwanted to U but I I tend to call M\nscript.js because that's pretty common\nuh name so I'm going to say script uh\nSource equals uh script.js here and so\nnow I am loading both the P5 library and\nthe um in my own JavaScript I haven't\nactually done anything yet but I'm just\nloading the file\num so again you could go read the uh P5\ntutorials but I'm just going to kind of\ndive into the code here um so the first\nthing that P5 is going to want is a\nsetup function and usually a draw\nfunction and the way that looks uh is\nyou just Define a function called setup\nand then in here goes some code this is\nusually setup code um\nand I'll just kind of get started so\nI'll call a function called create\ncanvas and this is a function that the\nP5 Library gives me and I'll give it a\nsize of I don't know 400\n400 and maybe just to get something\nworking I'll give it a background of\nlike red uh just to just to see it um\nand there it is there is my my Red\nCanvas it's right there I guess I'm\ngoing to get annoying cuz my face is\ngoing to be in the way but um there is\nmy my canvas which I have drawn a red\nbackground it is pretty annoying that\nglitch doesn't recognize these as\nfunctions because they are in the\nlibrary um but you can I guess just\nignore those uh errors for now because\nthey're not really errors um as long as\nit works over here you're\ngood so uh how did I know to call create\ncanvas and background so first off like\nI have used P5 quite a bit um just cuz I\nthink it's a really fun Library um but\nthe way I Learned was by going through\nthese tutorials and going through this\nreference so um this reference contains\npretty much every function that P5 gives\nyou and so let's see if I can find the\ncreate canvas uh\nfunction\num you always do like a contrl f or\ncreate\ncanvas there it is under rendering so if\nI click that I will get more information\nand you can read through and learn more\nbut essentially what you do is you call\ncreate canvas which creates\na a canvas a square usually or a\nrectangle um that you can then draw to\nand currently I am just drawing a\nbackground to it um so similarly you can\nread more about the background function\nif you want um so here's background and\nyou can read all about the different uh\nparameters it can take and uh how to set\ndifferent colors this is going to be\npretty similar to some of the CSS stuff\nwe've done um but it's it's a start um\nand then from here I can start to draw\nmaybe like shapes so uh maybe I'll draw\na circle so I can find a circle function\ndraws a circle sure and I can read\nthrough this here's some example code\nwhere it's uh creating a canvas drawing\na background and then drawing a circle\num you can usually um ignore this\ndescribe uh this is for things like\nscreen readers and if you want to\ninvestigate that that's totally cool um\nbut a common sort of misconception is\nthat the describe function tells P5 what\nto draw and it it doesn't um this is a\nway for you to describe your sketch to\npeople who who who can't see it um so\nanyway we're going to focus on this\ncircle function and you can learn more\nabout like what exactly those numbers\nare so x y and d and that's the location\nand then D is its width and height okay\nso if I go back to uh my code here I can\ndraw a circle and I'm just going to put\nsome kind of random numbers in there so\nI'm going to say like I don't know\n20050 maybe and there is my circle and\nwithout even really reading in a ton of\ndepth about like exactly what parameters\ndo what um you can just play around\nthat's one of the things I really like\nabout P5 um and like coupled with this\nglitch editor I think is a really good\ncombination um cuz I don't know what\nhappens if I change this 100 to a 150\nlet's\nsee and it moves down a little bit if I\nchange it to a\n200 moves down even further if I change\nit to like a 250\nmoves down even further and same thing\nover here if I change this to a 100 what\nhappens moves to the left if I change it\nto I don't know like a\n300 uh moves to the right and then\nfinally if I change this to I don't know\n100 gets a little bigger if I change it\nto I don't know like\n10 uh it gets teeny tiny still in there\nbut it's pretty small um so you can kind\nof learn what these uh parameters are\nfor and this is the X uh value so left\nto right you're saying put this 200\npixels over um the second one is your y\nposition which is like from top to\nbottom so top is actually zero which is\na little weird but um if you think of\nthe top as where like the web page\nstarts then it makes a little bit more\nsense um and then finally the size just\nthe how wide it is um so if I change\nthat back to 100 it gets a little bigger\num okay so then from there it's a matter\nof like figuring out what other shapes\nyou can draw what other things you can\ndo and for that your best friend is the\nP5 reference and so you can draw all\nkinds of stuff you can draw uh sort of\nthese primitive shapes like triangles\nand rectangles you can also get really\ninvolved and do things like you know 3D\nuh sort of modeling you can draw uh\ndifferent kinds of colors you can use\ntypography to like have different fonts\nand um like text sizes you can show\nimages all this good stuff and you can\nget really involved um in in like really\nAdvanced like visualizations um and it's\nreally fun um but the next thing I want\nto sort of show you is another concept\num so I could add a bunch of triangles\nand stuff but instead of that I'll\nintroduce you to uh something called the\ndraw function so the thing to sort of\nnotice here is that I defined the setup\nfunction but I never actually called it\nanywhere right so like in my\nindex.html you might expect like body on\nload equals setup or maybe a button on\nclick equals setup but I don't have that\nand I don't need it because P5 is\nactually calling it for me um so P5 has\ninternal logic that I don't really need\nto worry about that automatically calls\nvarious\nfunctions and setup is one of them um so\nif I go to reference I'm sure setup is\nin here um yeah setup so you can read\nmore about that but this is uh\nautomatically called by P5 one time at\nthe very beginning um there are many\nother functions that P5 calls\nautomatically at different times and one\nof the the most common ones is the draw\nfunction so if I have\nfunction um\ndraw and let me maybe move some of my\ncode maybe I'll move my circle into\ndraw and you'll see that my circle is\nstill there so P5 is calling the draw\nfunction um and where it gets\ninteresting is okay so what I should say\nis and if this is already enough for you\nyou're like okay I can draw different\nshapes and that feels that feels like\nenough and um if you're excited about\nlike okay let me just draw a bunch of\nshapes and like let's just get something\nworking on the screen that's totally\ncool and you can you can sort of stay\nthere and hear some examples like if you\nwant to draw an animal here's an example\nthat draws an animal if you want to draw\na Jacko Lantern here's an example that\ndraws a Jacko Lantern so if I go here to\nthat code um here it is I'm calling a\nbunch of P5 functions pass in arguments\nand parameters to um draw in this case\num a cute little pig um but you could\ndraw you know whatever you want um so if\nthat feels like enough that's cool uh\nyou can stay there uh however where P5 I\nthink gets uh extra interesting is the\nfact that this draw function is called\n60 times per second um so you actually\nhave uh like a 60 frames per second uh\nrender Loop it would be called um which\nis how you can end up creating\nanimations so I don't know let's see\nwhat's a what's a good way to do this um\nso instead of drawing it at like a\nhardcoded 200 200 which is right in the\nmiddle of my canvas um I want to draw\nthis where where the mouse is for\nexample um so if I didn't know how to do\nthat I could go to the reference and\nfind um like an input section maybe they\nchanged this around a little bit so I'm\nkind of getting used to it okay here it\ngoes so Mouse\num so I have Mouse X here that's a\nvariable that the P5 Library gives me\nand mouse y so if I go uh back to my\nproject here and what I'm going to do is\ndraw my circle at Mouse X and mouse\nY and right now the circle is drawn sort\nof in the upper left corner because I\nhaven't really moved my mouse onto the\ncanvas yet so it's just 0 0 which is the\nupper left corner but but if I move my\nmouse into my canvas the circle will\nsort of follow me\naround and\nooh\num and even with you know just like 1\ntwo three you know maybe five lines of\ncode I have this like super like\ninteresting looking uh uh little little\nart project here\num and so that's kind of the power of P5\nis you can start to have these like\nreally interactive really visual\nprojects um and it's just from functions\nand variables that are in the library um\nso one thing I want to call out is right\nnow uh Let me refresh this um the\nbackground starts out as red and then I\nmove my mouse around and it sort of you\nknow fills up the screen and they they\nstick around the old circles stick\naround\num and that is because if you think\nabout how this code is being called or\nwhen this code is being called setup is\ncalled one time at the very beginning\nwhen you first load the page and so it\ncreates a canvas which adds this uh sort\nof rectangular area to the page and then\nit draws a red background and then it's\ndone um and then immediately after that\nthe draw function is called 60 * per\nsecond and 60 * per second um this code\ndraws a circle wherever the mouse is so\nit's just on top of whatever was there\nbefore so if I wanted to change this so\nlet's say I wanted to only show like one\nCircle not have them sort of add up in\nthe background like that uh I can move\nmy call to background um so instead of\ncalling it only one time at the very\nbeginning I am going to call it every\nframe so now at the very beginning in\nsetup I create my canvas and that's all\nI do I just create my canvas and and I'm\ndone and then 60 times per second what I\ndo is I paint a red background which\nPaints the whole canvas red and then I\ndraw a circle where the mouse is so\nlet's look at what that\ndoes and now I only have a a single\nCircle um which follows the mouse round\nbecause I am using the mouse X and mouse\ny variables um but the background clears\nout the old circles essentially um every\nframe um so this is you know it kind of\ndepends on exactly the uh sort of effect\nyou're going for whether you want your\nold frames to like Stack Up and kind of\npaint over top of each other or if you\nwant to clear out the frame every time\nand and draw a new scene um so that is\nsetup and draw there are other functions\nso let's see how do I want to explain\nthis there's functions like uh let's say\ninstead of always showing a circle\nwherever the mouse is let's say I wanted\nto show it only when I clicked so uh I\ncould read more about this in the\nreference but uh here we go uh Mouse\npress or Mouse clicked um yeah Mouse\nclicked is here or Mouse pressed you\nknow it's kind of up to you whether you\nwant it to be like when you first press\nor after you click the whole thing you\ncan play around with with both but let's\nsee an example of what that looks like\nso if I instead have like\nfunction um Mouse\npressed and then in here what am I going\nto do I'm going to draw a circle where\nthe mouse is so I'm going to take this\nput it there and then the other thing\nI'm going to do is move this background\nback to set up so that my um old frames\nare not cleared out so now I don't show\nany circles yet I'm moving my mouse\naround but I don't see a circle but if I\nclick then I do draw a circle so I can\nclick around and I can sort of draw with\nmy Mouse um using like a really small\namount of code because we're relying on\nthe P5 Library uh so you can explore\nother functions there's other functions\nuh and it's interesting like if you're\non a phone you have other um sort of uh\nfunctions available to you so you can\nget like the tilt of the screen the\naccelerometer stuff like that um but\nMouse press will get you pretty far as\nwell if you're just kind of clicking\naround um so that's the idea of using\ndifferent functions in P5 these are\ndifferent callback functions and the\nnext thing I will talk about maybe the\nlast thing we'll see uh is um okay I\nhave two more things um one is first I'm\njust going to get this sort of back to\nback to normal without any Mouse pressed\nso I'm just drawing a circle um one of\nthe things I really like about P5 is\nthat it's a really fun like environment\nto play around with the concepts that\nwe've been learning this entire time um\nso if you're like hey I remember that we\ntalked about like variables and sort of\nchanging variables over time and I want\nto play with that idea um you can so\ninstead of having like Mouse X Mouse y\nmaybe I'll create a variable so I'll say\nup here I'll say like let I don't know\ncircle y equals 0 at first and then I'm\ngoing to draw a circle at Circle Y and\nmaybe I'll just hardcode uh actually\nthat needs to be like that's the X and\nI'll call this circle y\num so right now I am just drawing my\ncircle at a hardcoded value of 200 so\nit's like halfway across the screen and\nthen a value of circle y um Circle Y is\njust zero for now cuz that's all I've uh\nset it to um but here's where the magic\ncomes in if I change the value of circle\ny over time I can now create animations\nso let's do that so I'll just say like\nCircle Y plus plus so I'll add one to\nCircle Y every frame and we see the uh\nthe the ball dropping um and that's\nbecause if you think about how this uh\ncode is being called Draw is being\ncalled 60 * a second so 60 * a second I\ndraw a background which clears out every\nuh previous frame and then I draw Circle\nat Circle Y and then I increase Circle Y\nby one so then 1 160th of a second later\nuh Circle Y is now 1 and I draw a circle\nat\n2001 which is 1 pixel lower than it was\nthe last frame um then next time around\nit's two next time around it's three um\nso you're increasing Circle Y by one\nevery frame which lets you sort of have\nthis this effect where the ball is uh\ndropping over time um because you are\nincreasing that variable and this is\nlike a just a fun interesting way to\nplay with the idea of in this case\nvariables but you can play with lots of\nConcepts so just another example um\nlet's say I wanted to play with if\nstatements so we learned about if\nstatements before\nand you know we we used them in a sort\nof like I don't know website driven way\nwhich is fine cuz here we are we're\nlearning about web development but you\ncan also play with if statements in this\nmore like visual way uh and so let me\nsee let me just throw together an\nexample um so I'm going to create a\ncouple more variables so maybe I'll say\nlike let um maybe like Circle speed\nequals\n1 and uh maybe that's enough actually\nwe'll see um so what I want to do is now\nI have my circle y and it's increasing\nby one instead I'm going to increase it\nby Circle speed um so Circle\nspeed so this line of code is increasing\nCircle Y by Circle speed which is still\njust one so this is hasn't really\nchanged anything but what I can do is\nadd an if statement and I can say if uh\nCircle Y is greater than what if it's\ngreater than the the height the the\nbottom of my frame uh or my my canvas\nwhich is at this point 400 pixels um or\nI can go to the reference and is there a\nway for me to get the height and sure\nenough there is a variable called height\nthat the um P5 Library gives me so I'll\njust use that so if I go here so if\nCircle Y is greater than height then I\nwant to uh maybe multiply Circle speed\nby-1 so time equals -1 and let's see if\nthis works I actually don't know if this\nwill work let's find out so it's going\ndown and it's you know hitting this line\nof code where it increases by one and\nthen eventually it triggers this if\nstatement because Circle Y is you know 0\n1 2 3 4 all the way to 396 397 398\n399 400 and then it hits 401 and then\nthis if statement triggers and 4001 is\ngreater than height which is 400 and so\nI reverse the speed of my circle so I\nbasically just switch this back and\nforth between um from 1\nto1 um so I could also just say like\nequals negative 1 here but um you know\nif I have this to be like a five you\nknow if I speed it up this should still\nwork um yeah okay but I like it I like\nit to be slower than that I think um and\nthis is you know another like sort of\nplayground to play with the idea of if\nstatements this is the exact same\nconcept that we were using before but\nnow in this sort of interactive visual\nenvironment um so I can also sort of add\nsome logic here so I can maybe say like\nif Circle Y is less than zero or uh\nCircle Y is greater than height so now\nit should bounce off both the bottom\nwhich should do in a second yep okay and\nnow it should also bounce off the top\nlet's see\nhopefully and yeah so it's switching\nback and forth between one and negative\n1 or if I increase this it would be like\nbetween two and negative2 or whatever it\nwas um so this is really powerful and\nyou can do lots of things with this um\nand I could sit here and say oh you\ncould also use for Loops or arrays or\nobjects um all of the concepts that\nwe've learned about so far but instead\num if that sounds interesting to you I\nwill direct you back to uh this page uh\nthe\np5.js tutorials on happppy\ncoding. and there's a bunch of uh\nexamples here so if you wanted to play\nwith like using variables here's a way\nto practice that with some examples um\nif you wanted to practice I don't know\nhere's a couple with if statements uh\nhere's more about animation so if you\nwanted to I don't know it's almost\nHalloween so I can I can use my\nHalloween examples so here's an example\nthat shows a little ghost that sort of\num goes back and forth using some of\nthose Concepts that we talked about and\nuh if you look at the code you can see\nhere's things like here's an array that\nwe talked about before um here's some\ntrigonometry if you uh want to get into\nthat but um these are all Concepts that\nwe've we've talked about before calling\nfunctions using a for Loop um using an\narray these are all the concepts that we\ntalked about before just kind of in this\ninteractive environment\num so you can play with all kinds of\nstuff getting input or here's for Loops\nexamples\num or you know arrays objects you know\nall of this stuff you can go pretty deep\ndown the rabbit hole and there's lots of\ncool stuff that you can do um and\nhonestly like I love this stuff like I I\nnerd out about this stuff a lot um and\nit's a way to just sort of have fun with\ncode um in a way that you're not like\nnecessarily like making like a website\nfor a business you're just messing\naround around with code and I I really\nlove\nthat um okay let's see so the last thing\nthat I want to mention is I've sort of\nalluded to this a little bit but we\nhaven't really left like the environment\nthat we have been in this entire time so\nwe are using HTML we are using CSS and\nwe are using\nJavaScript the main new thing is we're\nusing JavaScript libraries um but\nhopefully that idea is is relatively uh\nstraightforward where you're calling\ncode that other people have written so\nyou know someone else wrote this\nbackground function someone else wrote\nthis circle function you don't really\nneed to worry about like exactly how\ndoes that work behind the scenes um you\ncan just use it and say okay cool I have\na background and I have a circle um but\nyou are still in your like standard web\ndevelopment environment so uh I haven't\nreally changed any of this text but you\nknow I could there's nothing stopping me\nfrom doing that um so if I go here I can\nchange that so I can say like I don't\nknow bouncing circle\ncircle and I can change this to whatever\nI want like watch the circle bounce and\nlet's see I can also do things like have\nyou know other HTML elements so I could\nhave I don't know my UL Li example in\nhere so like\nLi um you know I I don't know I'm not\ngoing to think too hard lies tigers\nbears that's my go-to tigers and bears\nand this is just HTML it's it's just\nnormal HTML that you've been learning\nthis entire time but it's now like in\nthis web page alongside this this canvas\nelement that P5 is giving you um I can\nalso use CSS so let's see if I wanted to\num add a style for I don't know my my\nH1 I could give it I don't know maybe\nI'll color it red\nand I have my my red H1 I'm just using\nCSS just like we have before uh I can\nalso uh style this canvas itself um so\nif I I don't know if I inspect this and\nI pop up my developer tools popped up in\nits own window um this is an HTML\nelement oh like got way too big um and\nhere it is you can see that this is what\ngets added to the page it adds this\ncanvas element which is a normal HTML\ntag that lets you draw to it uh using\nJavaScript um so it looks like this has\na class of five canvas and uh an ID of\nokay default canvas zero there's\nprobably ways to customize that but I\ncould also just use an element selector\non my canvas so let's try that so if I\nsay canvas and I don't know I want to\ngive it like a border of like a thick\nsolid black\nborder and there we go now it has a\nborder and so what we're doing is we're\nmixing all of the things that we've\nlearned about into a cohesive project\nwhere we're using HTML we're using CSS\nand we're using Java JavaScript and\nwe're even using JavaScript libraries to\ncreate this end result so if I wanted to\nI don't know set the background to an\nimage I could do that if I wanted to add\nsome more like descriptive text around\nmy sketch here I could do that and it's\nthe exact same Concepts that we've been\nlearning this entire time but um in this\nlike more like I don't know artistic or\nvisual or interactive uh project um okay\nso that is that's p5.js uh now that you\nhave learned about JavaScript libraries\nyou can use my favorite JavaScript\nlibrary and you can go down the rabbit\nhole and I I think it's a really great\nuh environment to to learn about the\nlike foundations of JavaScript um so\nthat's one of the reasons I really like\nit it's just honestly kind of fun um and\nI find myself just sort of playing\naround with it every once in a while to\nbe like oh could I do that could I draw\nthis like thing that I have in my brain\nusing P5 um and you know I'm not an\nartist but um I think it lets you be\ncreative and I think that's really fun\nso yeah from here you can check out the\nP5 tutorials if you want to go uh more\nin that direction or you could check out\nthe P5 reference in fact I recommend\nchecking out both and scrolling around\nand finding interesting looking um\nfunctions and variables and seeing what\nthey do and playing around uh you can\nalso uh if you like have an idea that\nyou want to implement in P5 hit me up\nand I'd love to chat through it and like\npoint you in a direction to like oh\nmaybe check out this this function or oh\nmaybe check out this other thing um so\nI'm always happy to nerd out about that\nstuff uh all right so I'll leave this\nvideo there um the next video will\nintroduce a a project in P5 but for now\nyou are now uh armed with the knowledge\nthat you need to start creating your own\nP5 projects uh which is really fun all\nright thanks for watching and as always\nof course until next time happy coding\n",
