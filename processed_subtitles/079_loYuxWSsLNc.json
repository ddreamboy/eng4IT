talking data visualization\nin today's day and age visuals are your\nbest friends when it comes to presenting\ndata spreadsheets powerpoints and\nlengthy word documents are no more with\naverage attention spans seeming to\nshorten by the day you must be able to\ntell your story through data in a manner\nthat's easy for the consumer to\nunderstand but how can you do that\nhi\nvisby and i are here to help and in this\nvideo we're going to answer all of your\nquestions regarding data visualization\nwhat exactly they are how you can use\nthem different examples and more get out\nyour pen and paper and let's begin\nshall we\nlet's start with what data visualization\nis while the term sounds scary a data\nvisualization is meant to make\nunderstanding information easier it's\njust a graphical representation of data\nrather than presenting data in a complex\nspreadsheet you can create an image that\nwill illustrate the information in a\nsimpler way viewers don't have to scour\na fact sheet looking for the story they\ncan easily scan and quickly find what\nthey're looking for and you don't have\nto be a data genius to create them\nanyone and everyone can create them no\nmatter their profession marketers\nteachers health care professionals\nconsider this infographic here your\nprofession is not an excuse to not\ncreate data visualizations you can\ncreate so much value for your audience\nby spending just a little bit of extra\ntime building them\ni just mentioned creating value for your\naudience let's dive into four ways of\ndoing so\nthe first reason is how easy it makes\ndata to digest you can write a full\nreport if you'd like and hope that your\naudience reads it all the way through to\nunderstand your point or you can create\nan infographic like this which is still\nsomewhat complex but simplifies the\ninformation in an easy to understand\nmanner imagine if all of this was\nwritten in paragraph form\nyikes\nthe second reason is the ability to\ndiscover patterns easier trends emerge\nfrom data over time and if you monitor\nthat data through graphics they're much\neasier to notice scatter plots or charts\ncan help you identify them and then once\nyou do present them with an infographic\nsimilar to this one i haven't mentioned\nthis yet but all the examples you'll see\nin this video are templates you can edit\nin visme right now so keep them in mind\nif you've been learning or gathering\ninformation for a long period of time a\ndata visualization can help you compile\nthat information into one place it's\nmore engaging and an image is always\neasier to remember than text alone\nwhich is our fourth reason the visual\nnature of a data visualization helps\nviewers understand and remember it\nbetter they'll soak in that image like a\nsponge and will be able to recall the\ninformation that went with it this is a\ndetailed infographic about\nbioluminescence in australia the\ngeographical image makes it easier to\nremember where it's present in where\nit's not along australia's eastern coast\nall right we have our feet wet in the\ndata visualization pond let's get a\nlittle bit deeper now and explore five\nways data visualization can be used one\nis to plan schedules are you familiar\nwith google calendar well that's become\na data visualization you can layout a\ntimeline or project plan for your days\nor months whether through google or on\nyour own if you're on deadline a\nvisualization showing what needs to\nhappen before the big day is a great\nidea i suggest starting at the end and\nworking backwards\nanother way data visualization is used\nis to pinpoint relationships how are two\nor more things related this is when a\nscatter plot becomes your new best\nfriend\nif time is one of the variables in your\ndata a graphic can help share changes\nover that time period by recognizing the\ntrends from the past your data\nvisualization will help you predict what\noutcomes to expect in the future\nfrequency falls in line with predictive\nability as well after you've compiled so\nmuch data you'll have an idea of the\nfrequency you can expect something this\nwill require a lot of research but will\nbe helpful for both yourself and your\nviewers\nand our last way that data\nvisualizations are typically used is to\ninterpret value and risk rather than\nsorting through pages of information a\nsimple data visualization can help you\nassess a situation and determine if\ntaking action is necessary your brain\ncan process multiple variables much more\neasily in an infographic than it can in\na page full of text\nall right you've heard me touch on\nvarious types of data visualizations\nalready to haunt any confusion and\nanswer any questions let's touch on some\nof the most popular\nstart with graphs let me preface this by\nsaying there are dozens of graphs you\ncan choose from for the sake of this\nvideo i'm only going to share a couple\nof the most popular pie charts were our\nbest friend in third grade and well you\nshould reconnect after all these years\nif you have seven or less percentage\npoints and their differences in value\nare wide use a pie chart they're simple\nand everyone understands them\nbar charts are another good example for\neasily understood data visualizations\nthey mostly speak for themselves and i'm\nsure you've seen them before again
