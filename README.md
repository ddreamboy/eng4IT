# eng4IT

Eng4IT is an innovative application designed to enhance language learning through interactive chat exercises. Modeled after Duolingo, it allows users to engage in dialogues where they must respond by selecting words in the correct order. This project leverages advanced AI models to provide context-rich responses and real-time translations, making language learning both fun and effective.
