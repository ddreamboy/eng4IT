uipath is the most advanced RPA tool in
the world I'm anus Jensen a professional
RPA teacher and a two-time UI path most
valuable professional let's learn some
uipath
to install uipath you go to uipath.com
then click try uipath3 in the upper
right corner
here we want to install the full
automation Cloud for community that is
the free full version so click the get
automation Cloud for community
fill in your email
and a password and click create account
now you will be sent a verification code
on email so let's go check our email
it's already there
so I'll copy this number here
and I'll go back to the setup and paste
it in and click continue
here I'll put in my full name
and my country I'm from Denmark so I'll
go find out
and click next
then I want to put in my organization
name mine is called anasians and orc and
I'll create the organization
then a few seconds will went by
that's it then we'll download uipath
Studio by clicking up here
we will wait before the 800 megabyte is
downloaded
that's it we can start it
here we will choose the quick setup this
is the version that you want to use
click I accept the terms in the license
agreement and click install
if you click ok to this you'll lose this
YouTube video because it will close all
your browser windows
please go up to the UIL of this video
and market and copy it so you can find
it after you clicked OK here
then when you have the address of this
video you can click OK here
then you will click ok to force close
all windows like that
and we have completed the setup
here we can press launch uipath Studio
to Startup UI path Studio
now click sign in
that will take you to the cloud
uipath.com where we can automatically
verify our installation
first of all I want to say open uipath
here
then we are automatically verified I
also want to restore the pages from
before so I click restore here then we
are back at the uipath so let's go down
to Studio again you can find it here
Studio or Studio X we want to go with
Studio always studio studio X is a light
version of uipath very few people use it
you will find very little documentation
and help so please go with uipath Studio
click here
this is uipath I will just click don't
show here and close and let me maximize
first I want to go to tools over here to
the left so I'll click it
click uipath extensions if you want to
install browser extensions for example
for Firefox you can do it here that is
if you want to automate that browser
we have installed Chrome and Edge for
the matter so we're good we will let
this be
then click settings go to design
scroll a little bit down to use modern
for new projects the default is yes but
if you had an older installation of
uipath this will not be default so you
just need to make sure that this is yes
we are to go
we also want to inspect the uipath
assistant
you can find it out here in the tray it
looks like this I can double click it
the UI path attended manager here we can
start and start Automation and inspect a
lot more
if you see this green light up here that
means that you have connected uipath to
the uipath assistant
if for somehow it is red gray or blue it
might look like this let me just sign up
then I go back here you can see that
this is gray I just click sign in here
and again I will just click open UI path
and we're signed in
if you want to find the uipath assistant
if it's not down here in your tree then
you can go to your Windows start menu
and search for uipath assistant and
start it right here however we're good
so let's start building our first robot
I'll close down the uipath system and
let me close down some of these browser
veins
I can also close down this Outlook I'm
not going to use my email for now
then we go back to wipe Studio you can
always start uipath studio in your start
menu as well by searching for uipath
studio and you can of course make
shortcuts such as sending it to the task
bar
go back here so when you start up uipath
Studio it will start on start and to
create a new process you go up to new
project process
and then we'll give it a name I will
call this one uipath
beginners course we can specify a
location to default your uipath code is
in your documents you can change it by
clicking this folder here and choose a
folder elsewhere it's good for now one
thing that I would like to talk about is
whether or not you should use VB Visual
Basic or C sharp it's both under the.net
framework and you might be inclined to
use the C sharp because that's the most
common language compared to Visual Basic
but uipath used Visual Basic since its
beginning that means that every
documentation page every tutorial videos
everything is in Visual Basic so unless
you have a very good reason to don't
choose to see Sharp I'll click create
let me skip this tour
yeah
and I'll open up the main workflow
this is where our activities go
we'll drag him into this canvas it's
called Main and it's the default
workflow sequence the dependencies that
refer to packages linked to this project
these ones are default but we can
install more
here you also see our main
if I click activities down here here are
our predefined code blocks
I can drag and drop these code blocks
into my main sequence
for example I can just use a right line
here and I can enter the term text so
here I can say hello in quotation marks
and I can run the robot this is our very
first robot
that's it you will not see anything but
if you go down to the output you can see
our little message down here make the
output again to minimize
you will find a lot more actions down
here we can expand for example the UI
automation we can go into the
application and you can see a lot of
actions here
for example I can't drag in a use
application browser here then I'll need
to point to an application to automate
let's say I want to automate the
calculator so just open this this could
be literally any application
then I'll say indicate application to
automate here
and you can see it turns green
then I will click it now we will open up
the windows calculator
and if I click this use application
calculator then I go over here to the
right click this little wrench here that
the properties and here you'll see some
properties
her default our automation will close
down the application if it's opened it
I'll choose never here and that's only
because I want to see what's going on
oh let us close down the calculator once
more try to run it
there you go you could see that the
application called calculator opened in
the background
let's also say I want to click a button
and I go back here I could of course
find that click action down here in all
these actions but I could also go up and
search activities and search for a click
don't worry you will get used to all
these actions when you build that's why
it's so important that you build build
with me you will learn much more than
just passively watching so if you
already haven't started your uipath
studio please pause the video and start
it up and build these things with me
then we'll take a click and drag it in
this do container
here you can see that uipath actually
guides us it says indicate in app
calculator so if I click here I can
choose all these ones here say I want to
choose number five I simply just click
left with the mouse and uipath
automatically creates an address for
this button I can click confirm
now let's try to see it works and for
Simplicity I'll close it down I run over
here we have the debug and if I click
this drop down I can choose run file
debug or run I'll usually just go with
run file that's the fastest one if we
want to
debug our code that is to make it
correctly looking so there will be no
errors then we'll use the debug we might
use it a little bit later
so I'll click run file
now we'll open up a calculator and we
press number five that's it that's how
easy it is to automate uipath
let's build an end-to-end project where
I will teach you all the best UI path
practices
so let's delete what we have built so
far you just marked as use application
then you press delete on your keyboard
you could also Mark it or right click
and then click delete
so now we just have our main sequence
let's download the course materials
to open up a browser
and let me just close this one here here
it is I created this course page for you
the link is in the video description
below
here I want to click this gray button
download course materials
that will take you to my OneDrive where
a zip folder with the things that we
need
click the three dots and then click
download you of course also welcome to
create these things yourself
let me just do this the calculator I'll
place it in my desktop
here I will right click and I will
extract everything
that is fine I will extract it then I
can delete the zip file to not confuse
myself
let's go inspect the project folder so I
double click it and I'll drag it in from
my other screen
we have two folders in it we have an
input and we have an output
in the input you'll find an Excel book
products to be scrape
I'll open it
that's it
we have a sheet called products one that
is the sheet that we will work on first
here we will look at the two products
Nike t-shirt and Asic Gel later on we
will take products 2 and face more
challenges
again open up uipath Studio download
these course materials I'll promise you
that you'll learn UI path much much
faster
now close this
then we go back to the project folder we
also have an output folder in it and if
I double click here it is empty we will
fill in the things ourselves
so I'll close this
I'll also go to the project folder I'll
need the path to this folder we will use
it in uipath and I just hover my mouse
over press shift in right click and
you'll see this copy as path emerges it
only works if you press shift on your
keyboard right on your mouse at the same
time then I can click copy as path I'll
go back to uipath make sure you click
the main sequence go down to variables
here we will create a variable
the variables manager will open when you
click variables I can click it again
closes now it opens
we will go up to name and then we will
give our variable a name since this is
our project path I will call it project
off
it will be of the type string that's the
most common variable type
in uipath a variable is a container for
a value that means that we give it a
value and then we can use the name
project path to get that value it will
be very easy when these values changes
and it's also best practice to use
variables when things can change a lot
and here in the default I'll press Ctrl
V that will be our path
a string variable in uipath is always
surrounded by quotation marks and we
will have it here
as I said this could change a lot this
is because we will use the project
folder right now on our desktop but
imagine that we move this project into
production it will definitely not stay
on our desktop
but for now it's fine I'll just close
this variables manager again
we want to open up a web page
so if I go down here
and I go to the course materials again
we will use the global jdsports.com that
is just a simple sports apparel website
it will mimic all the websites that we
can use for example an Erp cloud system
a CRM system anything where we search
and we want to get data out we'll also
close this downloaded thing here so
we'll have maximum of screen
with that open you either need to click
the link on the course page or just go
to
global.jdsports.com we can go back to
uipath
again we want to open up an application
or a browser
we use that with the use application
browser with the calculator so we can
find it here in recent we could of
course also find it down here and let me
just collapse this so it looks a little
bit nicer or I can search for use
application slash browser we have it
here but it's in the recent so I can
just do this
I want to indicate it
so I click here and here you can see our
browser if it is orange like it is here
it says that we cannot communicate with
our browser we simply just need to press
escape and fix it so go back to our
browser we want to look if we have
installed and activated the Chrome
extension so go up here to extensions
click manage extensions
then scroll a little bit down here you
can see the uipath web automation you'll
need to enable this
this also means that we can now grab the
browser I'm going to close down these
extensions I might need to refresh the
browser but let's go try it again so if
I click indicate application to automate
you can see it turns green now I can
click with the mouse and this means that
we are now working at the global
jdesports.com everything we need to do
in that browser will go in this do
container
again we can try to run it so if I click
this drop down I can click run file
you'll see that nothing really happens
and that is because of some properties
let's try to figure out what happened
so if I have marked this make sure you
click it here so the properties belong
to that one we'll go over to Open click
this drop down here I can say I will
never open up a new browser that's a
setting that will really use because we
want to open it
we can also say that we always want to
open up an instance or the default
settings is that if it's not open but
because we had it open it did not open
if I choose always here then it will
open up a new window that's sometimes
optimal
here in the close I click this drop down
here it will close down the browser if
uipath opened it that's the default
that's this one I want to see what's
going on I'll just manually close it
while we develop here in the beginning
so I'll choose never
let's try to run it again so I click run
file
now you see that it went really fast but
we opened up a new window
I go back to uipath
let's try to do a search on this site so
I go up here to activities then I'll
find a type into and I'll drag it into
the do container
again I need to indicate where I want to
type into
I click the indicating crew here I want
this search buckets up here you can see
that this box there's a green border
around it that's the one I want to pick
uipath automatically
create an address for us it's called a
selector and we have multiple selector
types you don't need to understand it
now you just need to know what it is you
have a strict selector we have a fussy
selector and we have an image selector
each one of these uipath will determine
which one of these are the strongest
It's usually the fussy selector and then
it will use if it cannot find that it
will use the image as a second result
we will look much more into these
selectors and descriptors click on
just click confirm
so now we told you I path where we want
to type in
best practice is to rename your
activities
you can see that this says type into
input SRC input
go down here and double click
and then instead of type into input
whatever that is I'll delete this and
then I'll say search field and click
enter it's always best practice to
rename it up here it says use browser
Chrome JD Sports Global shop online now
that looks fine
then we can say what do I want to search
for
now I'll just hard code in the value
that means that I will not use a
variable I'll just use a string that I
type in here and again a string and
uipath need to go into quotation mark
so put in a quotation mark a new iPath
automatically put in the second one yeah
I'll search for Nike t shirt like this
I also want to send an enter click
because it's not enough just to type
this in I want to do the search as well
so I can place my mouse in the end I can
click this drop down and here I can find
some keyboard clicks I can find the
enter one and UI path automatically put
in the code for and enter click that's
it
try to run it again so I go up here run
the file and you'll see that we open up
a new page and we do a search
if I go back to the browser you can see
that we now search for night t-shirts
and these are our results
here I want to extract all this data
what I want here is the title the price
and the UIL because each one of these I
can get inside
and have more details so I want the URL
tied to it one challenge is that you can
see here we have a normal price but on
some of the products it looks a little
bit different and that is a challenge
that we need to face so let me scroll
all the way up go back to uipath Studio
now we want to scrape the data first
let's make sure that we only have one
web page open just to make it easy for
ourselves here I have the search result
and this was the initial page let me
just close that one here it's only to
make it easier for ourselves uipath can
find handle it I go back to uipath this
is structured data and it looks look at
it again here I want to extract each
element and I go back to UI path uipath
have an extraordinary wizard for this
and that is the table extraction so I go
up here and click the table extraction
I first want to pick the title so I'll
say add new column
here we can pick the title easily I can
pick the outer or the inner I want to
pick the inner because that's the most
narrow one it usually doesn't matter I
like to pick the most narrow one that
suits our selection here I can extract
text or URL I'll pick text because
that's what we want to extract first
that will be our title
uipath automatically says well this
title the all these has the same
properties as the one you selected I'll
go scrape these structured data isn't
that clever click confirm then I'll say
title I'll also and then I can say enter
I'll also add a new column with the URL
so I'll click add a new column and then
I'll pick the URL this is the same place
as before so I'll just go click here
extract URL
you can see that uipath automatically
says this is called title UL that's
because it's the URL tied to the title
now I want the price
and here you can see that there's a
regular price for example 33 and 18 and
there's a sales price because those two
are different formats that means that I
can choose two strategies I can either
choose just to have this narrow one but
then we might not have this one with us
so what I will do is to grab everything
in the price area I'll say add new
column
and I'll grab everything I will not grab
a price here not this not this but
everything here I'll just click and now
you can see that we grab everything it
also means that we will do some jaded
gymnastics to get the right data out
whenever we have a sale but that's just
a nice challenge for us click confirm
here we will call this price and click
enter
now we have the data that we want but
let me scroll down we have data on
multiple pages
here we have five pages I want to scrape
data on each one of these five pages so
up here in the extract data for multiple
Pages I'll take it yes and then I'll
need to find a yes button next button
sorry is this one I'll click it uipath
automatically creates a selector for us
this one I can reveal that we will face
some challenges with it but these are
challenges that we face as an RPA
developer so I really want to show you
what we can do to fix all these things
because you'll learn a lot just do what
I do now we're done I'll click save and
close
so if I scroll a little bit down you can
see uipath automatically creates a data
table called extract table data table I
can see that if I click here go to
variables and we have created an extract
data table called data table that is
where uipath save the results too a data
table looks and appears like an Excel
sheet except that it only exists in the
robot's memory that means that when we
start the robot and this get initialized
it will be there but when the robot ends
and this is actually right after this
the data will be gone so we need to save
it and this usually needs to be saved to
an Excel sheet a CSV file or similar no
problem we'll do that I'll minimize this
make sure you have this activated by
clicking one again up here in properties
in the timeout the default is 30 second
this means that it looks for the next
button for 30 seconds but that might be
a little bit too long I have a fast
internet connection so I'll choose five
here you can do the same to speed
everything a little bit up in case you
have a slow internet connection you
might just want to go with 30.
now let's write this data table back to
an Excel sheet so I go up to activities
and then I'll find a right range I can
choose the Excel activities those ones
are good because they are easy to figure
out the workbook activities though those
ones are two separate branches the Excel
and the workbook the workbook has the
advantage that here we can do it without
having Excel installed let's start with
that and let's go back to the Excel ones
later in the lesson so I'll find the
right range workbook and drag it in here
we can fill in the data table first
because that's the data that we want to
write back to Excel and here we have the
extract data table so that one is easy
to fill in I could start to write it but
press controls based on your keyboard
and you will have the intellisense auto
completion on press tab
then I can specify what sheet name do I
want to put it in this will be in the
string format so I'll have a quotation
mark uipath automatically creates the
second one
I'll call it Nike
teach it for now then we need a workbook
path let me minimize this minimize this
and this we have our project path and
let me double click to open it I want to
save into the output one so we'll need
to find the project part we saved that
as a variable in the beginning remember
then I'll go into the output and I'll
Define what Excel name I want to save to
it will look like this so I go up here
press Ctrl space again and then find the
project path press tab
then you want a plus now I need to type
something in so again you guessed it
quotation marks then I want to say
backwards last because I want to go into
the output folder and then I want to say
what Excel name do I want I can type
everything I want here I'll just call
this
scrape data dot xlsx that's important
because this will be in Excel file
that's sufficient and if I just click up
here you'll see that this warning
disappears
you want to go to properties and also
add headers that's it I can click save
but our workflow is also saved when we
click run file you can see it is a steer
risk next to the main that means that we
have unsaved changes
I revealed that we had a problem but let
me just show you what that problem is
so now I run it I'll open up the JD
Sports search for it you can see up in
the URL that we
easily moving with the next button
280 Now we move back and forth between
two sides so this selector for the next
button is not created well something is
wrong no problem we work with these
selectors that is the addresses of the
elements a lot
let me go back to uipath so I go back
here click stop
then we want to say I want to modify
this and to do so Mark the extract data
table click this ribbon here edit
extract data then we will have this
wizard pack
to fix the next page next button
selector I'll click this wheel here and
here you can see that we have something
that we might not want that is this from
72 we even have an image usually we want
to go with the strict selector when we
want to narrow the things down a fighter
selector is a more generic one that can
take more things that look like each
other whereas a strict selector will
only select one or at least select fewer
things than if I selector
so mark this untick the fossil untick
the image click this blue one here and
that will open up the UI Explorer which
is a really nice thing so if I open up
here I can see that this ID I don't want
it and I can also see the header here
the parent here is called chrome.x and
then a title called night t-shirt that's
the one up here if I scroll down here I
can see this child that is the actual
identifier to the next button here let's
get rid of the ID
right now you can see that the next
button is there and we can actually
validate it right now because since we
changed it this one turns yellow uipath
doesn't know whether it's present or not
it should be present now so when I click
here you can see that this turns green
and it we have a check mark it's there
similarly I can press the 5 let me go
down here I press the five now we
shouldn't have it and it uh we can
validate here
and that's it it turns red make sure you
go to the one again otherwise UI path
will back so I can just validate once
more that's fine we have built a stable
selector for the next page button it
says that Target element is not visible
on the screen we know that it is so we
will just click OK here and I'll click
confirm then we'll click save and close
and we will try to run the bot once more
to see that this next one works
here we navigate to all the pages it
will take five seconds before it it
looks for the next button now at the
last page and then it will finish
let's go to the output folder here you
can see we have created an Excel book if
I double click it
there you go we have our data we have a
lot of them we have like
294 rows the first one is headers though
and you can see here we still have some
work to do we get the prices out right
here that's fine but we also have some
gymnastics to do here because I want to
get the now price of all these sales but
these ones are just nice challenges for
us
so let me close this one again and we
will move on
now we want to instead of just searching
for a night t-shirt we want to extract
multiple search results and multiple
Pages let us go back to the project
folder I'll go into the input
open up this input sheet I want to look
at this input sheet called products to
be scraped and I want to go into
products one right now I want to search
for First Night t-shirts and then Asic
Gel so we'll create a dynamic solution
it's very easy to do as well so let's
get started
to pay attention to that deprived column
header is called Product I'll close this
one here and go back here
here we can use the workbook activities
again but I promise you to show you the
power of the Excel once
I'll go up here in this start
let's search for an Excel process scope
an Excel process scope is the one that
surrounds all RXL activities so I'll
drag that one in the beginning it
doesn't say much but what I want to do
is to mark it then go over here the show
Excel Window do I want to have Excel
visible Wildlife robot works I don't
really want to so I'll just click false
but if you like to see your Excel sheet
gets updated you will not click faults
here but usually this is just a
distraction and a performance a little
bit it will it will create a little bit
of lag in performance
so then we will use use Excel file
that is this one here and again you will
learn these actions I'll just use them
for now and I'll promise you that if you
build these things with me and if you
start building your own projects this
will be very easy for you
first of all we will need Excel file and
here we will need to put in a workbook
path we still have our project path so
press control space and find the project
path which is here then we'll say plus
again as we did with the output I'll
have a quotation mark then I'll have it
backward slash I'll have the input and
then another backward slash now I want
to fill in the actual name of the Excel
one here and this is product to be
scraped xlsx
to make sure I don't miss bill I'll just
click here and make sure I Mark
everything if you don't have the
extensions you will just add it manually
in uipath so I Ctrl C I copy this and
then I'll go back here now move in here
I'll just Ctrl V paste it in this is
what I'm going to read when we want to
refer to this Excel file we refer to it
as Excel
we're not going to create it if it
doesn't exist that means that if this
sheet doesn't exist UI path will create
it per default we're not interested in
that because if it's not there we don't
want to read something some blank one
here so I'll just untick the create if
not exists
now I will read this data into a data
table so I'll go up to activities once
more and then I'll find a read range and
I'll drag it in here
the range I want to read let's talk a
little bit about that here I just want
to read an entire sheet and let us just
be 100 sure which sheet we're going to
reach so I'll double click here
that one was called products one so back
again to uipath what I can do here is to
go over here in range I can go over to
the plus kick plus I can say Excel I can
say custom input
I can say sheet and worksheet name in
quotation mark that one will be
products one
then I'll click save
now you can see that uipath creates this
expression for us that's the Expressions
that the Excel activity use you could
write them yourself say Excel that is
this reference up here dot sheet and
then in quotation mark and a parentheses
you will have the actual sheet name
then we'll go down to save tune now we
will save it into a data table so we'll
need to create one we could of course
create a down here in variables but a
smart trick is to press Ctrl K that will
create a variable when we start typing
I'll call this one
products and when you click enter here
we have created a data table variable so
again when you are here in the blank one
press Ctrl K and you can see down here
we have created a variable called data
table
and it's mt4 now but when we start the
robot we read the Excel data to hit
now I'm going to iterate to each one of
these rows in the products data table
remember that's the one that we scrape
from up here we only have two goods that
was the Nike t-shirt and I think it was
some Asics huge shoes doesn't really
matter it was too good that we want to
iterate true but this solution will work
if we had 100 rows in our Excel sheet
so go up to activities and then you'll
find a for each row in data table since
this is a data table
and drag it in here you'll see that this
q and row this is just a name for
reference you can say current production
email q and car whatever your date is
current row is fine for now but it just
referred to the to the row that we're
entering through because if for each row
and data table take the rows in the data
table one by one and do something about
it so over here again I press Ctrl space
and here you'll find the products that
is our data table so for each one of
these products what do we actually want
to do well what we want to do here
is that we want to do this search and
the web scrape
so and I will only open the browser once
so I'll first mark this use browser and
then I'll drag it up here just before
the for each row so I'll drag it up here
can you see right here at the plus I've
placed it in
so what I then want to do I could of
course have designed it otherwise but I
want to show you how you move these
things around then I want to say in this
browser instance we're still in this
Excel one then I want to have the for
each row in data table so mark that and
we want to drag it in the first just up
here
so now we have it into the browser and
we only open the browser once but we're
going to type for each one of the
products and that is what we do down
here so press it now you press Ctrl n we
also want to do an extraction for each
product and we want to write to an Excel
sheet so what you will do here is that
you will Mark everything and then you'll
press Ctrl X then you'll go down here
press Ctrl V now you can nav you can cut
and paste these activities throughout
your flow and let us just see what's
going on we're reading the Excel we're
using a file then we read it into a data
table we open up our browser then we're
entering to each one of these we only
have two products and then we will do a
search for that product we will extract
the data and write it out to a sheet
right now these ones will just be
searched for night t-shirt twice and
we'll override it so let's go fix that
up here we will not have this Nike
t-shirt we will still have this K enter
so let us just delete the night t-shirt
and then so we will I'll just have a
space I'll have a plus here in the first
one and spaces will just be ignored it's
just an easier way to represent data now
I want to refer to the product in this
iteration so I'll refer to the cuned row
up here and then I'll say what column do
I need to log in we only had one column
remember it was called Product
again let me just open it so what's
going on
that was in the products one we have
this column it was called Product and
here I just want to take this one first
and then this one and do searches and
data scraving so what we will do here
move in here
go to the big beginning I'll just do
this control space current row and I'll
say dot item item is the column and I'll
say parentheses start quotation marks
and then I'll say product quotation mark
parentheses and since this is an object
I'll say dot to string this is the net
method to string this will make it a
string so we can use it in a type in two
so now we search and we press enter but
we do it dynamically in regard to what
product we have up here so that one is
fixed the data is scraping that one was
the dynamic and remember we removed the
Nike from the next button then since I
have the product expression here let me
just grab it up here so Mark everything
here Ctrl C and we will use the sheet
name of the product so it will just look
like this
now and let me try to close these things
here just to make completely sure that
we actually scrape the data that we want
so now I'll do this
we're opening up the browser we're doing
one search Nike t-shirt and then we're
navigating through each one of the
actual ones so here we're taking
page 4 page five then it will end now it
should write to Excel and then we should
do our new search in a little while
it will be sxtl there you go
and I only think there's one page here
so it will just stop let us just inspect
that one first I'll go here you can see
we only have one page so just start
there that was nice let's also make sure
that we have the right data in our
output folder double click here now we
have overwritten the script data
of course the Nike one will be all the
same but I have a Nike t-shirt now that
one looks the same as before let me go
up but I also have an Asics Gel these
ones are the Asics Gel now we have done
Dynamic scraping
I have a problem so let me close here
this scrape data gets overwritten from
time to time I usually just don't want
to override data this bot could run say
one time each day 10 times each day and
then I want to save the data from each
one of the runs
so I go back here let me instead of just
testing in here let me introduce you to
a nice concept as an RPA developer if I
go to the project here you'll see the
project will have the dependencies here
that's the packages that uipath by
default users will have our main this
main is this one here I usually just
create a test sequence instead of this
main so I go up here click new sequence
and here I'll call this one test
I will click create
so you can see it shows up here it has
nothing tied to to the main this is just
a playground for me to do nice things
and test things what I need to remember
is that in the end when we deployed this
to production then we want to make
completely sure that we don't have tests
because that's just fill and disturbance
but for now it's nice to have a
playground and I all I always have this
when I develop these robots
so I marked this test I go to activities
let's find a message box so I'll search
for a message box and I'll drag it in a
message box is nice for debugging it
pops up a message to the user it will
pause the robot until we click ok so
it's nice when we want to inspect things
I want to use the date and time for
doing the file naming so I go down here
press control space then I want to say
date time this is again a visual
basic.net
coding so you need to know a little bit
about that make sure you stick to the
end of this video where I'll recommend
books about uipath and especially this
coding so here I'll say now that will
get me the time of now
and then I'll say to string because this
date time now will be in the date time
format so we can really print it out to
a message box unless we apply the.net
method to string
let us try to run this again and again
this is just in our chest so it'll only
open up this message box now we have a
nice date time but we have a problem and
that is because we cannot use this in a
file format we have forward slashes and
colons so let's make it nicer to look at
I'll click OK this is also a nice
exercise in working with date and times
so I can Define the format by going here
I can have a parentheses and now you can
see I see that this help says that we
need a provider and here I'll just have
quotation marks and then I'll specify
what format I want it out in
I want the years that'll be four wise in
case you want to know what these y's
stand for it looks a lot like the ones
that you use in Excel then you can
google.net custom date and time format
strings
so then I'll have the month days are
hours minutes seconds I'll use the
seconds in the file name and that is if
the robot ran during this same minute
this will not get overwritten at this
time as well so let me try to run it
again
and C show you that we can now use this
text in a file format this will be
unique down to the last second you could
add middle seconds as well and in case
you only run runs a day you could get
rid of these hours minutes and seconds
for us it's quite nice so what I will do
here
is that I'll use this expression in our
main so I'll copy this one here and go
to the main what we will do that in the
beginning when the robot starts we will
get the current date and time we could
do it in the variables manager but for
visibility I'll put it in here in the
end in start drawing then I'll go up
here I'll press Ctrl K this will create
a new variable when it is in the sign it
will just create a string variable I'll
call this now
and then we will give it the value that
we just had so I'll press Ctrl V now we
have this one in a variable called now
then we can use it down here when we
save the data so in the right range
workbook I can put in the now after this
output and before the script data so
what this will look like now we need to
combine again as we did before with
combine the variable with some
hard-coded things so I'll end this
output with a quotation mark then I'll
say plus and I'll pick the now I'll say
plus and a quotation mark to start this
one here I might also want to go in here
and have an underscore so I can run the
robot once more
here we will open up the web pages and
do the searches once more but now we
will not overwrite data because the date
time that is a unique
string down to the second and of course
our robot will not run during the same
second
here you can see that you have finished
now we have the Asics Gel and we only
have one page
it will finish in five seconds it looks
for the next button that's it and if I
go to this one here there you go we now
have Dynamic file naming everything in
the output folder will never be
overwritten
instead of the right range workbook we
could go completely Excel activities it
works this is fine but you might want to
go with these Excel activities those
ones will be the Future these are so
easy use uipath started to implement
them in studio X and are now using them
here in studio
so if we go over here
since we're going to use a new Excel
file we're not going to
um we cannot use this use Excel file up
here so what we will do is down here we
will have another use Excel file
I'll drag it in here so the workbook
path well we just created it down here
so I'll just Ctrl a Ctrl Z paste it up
here so now we have a workbook path
we will not reference it to excel
because we already chose that one up
here so we can just call this one Excel
result
we want to create it if it not exist
that is because the first time it will
not exist so we will create it and
furthermore we will just overwrite it or
sorry append to it because it already
exists with this name
now we will write the data to this Excel
sheet that will be the data from here so
go up here and then you'll find a right
data table to excel drag it in here
want to write well that will be the
extract data table so I will just find
it here
now go down and copy this one here so we
have copied this is the sheet name and
here we will use the same sheet
expression as we did up here in where we
refer to the sheet let me just find it
that will be this one here so we could
write it or we could be lazy again and
make sure that we don't make any
mistakes so if I go to destination I'll
go to plus sign make sure you pick the
Excel results because that's the one we
refer to now I'll take custom input I'll
take sheet
and here I will paste this one in this
will not be in quotation marks since
this is not a string a hardcoded string
so now you'll see that I want to use the
Excel result sheet and then we will use
the Q and product name as the actual
sheet name now I can delete this this
will also work so if I save it and run
the file I could again just run file
it's an old habit just to save it here
and there now we run the robot and we
could start to close down the browser
instances because we are not closing in
we wanted to let them stay open because
we needed to see what what's going on
and when the robot fails we wanted to
see what might have went wrong but now
we can see that everything works we have
built a nice robot that scrapes multiple
products it's great multiple Pages it
writes down to excel with these few
actions let me just show you how little
we just did we just did these I think
this we have like six or seven actions
and we accomplish this much we still
have work to do but one step at a time
and let me just minimize this let's
close down some of the browsers well
that wasn't too much
that will be this so if I go to my
scraped results this will be the last
iteration we'll see that this works as
well I have a problem because my price
can take two formats one that looks well
we might want to move the bridge pound
sterling and one that is really not too
well or at least we want to get the now
result
we can do this in several ways a very
cool way to do it and a thing that you
will practice a lot as an RPA developer
that is regular expressions or regex so
if I go to a browser then you want to
search for regex
101.com
reg X is a series of characters that
defines a search pattern
first thing you'll want to do is to
click this.net c-sharp that is because
we use the.net engine then we need our
things that the two formats that the
price can take if I go here I'll first
just pick one of these regular ones we
can take the first one
go here paste it in in the test string
then you can have an inter-click doesn't
matter how many I'll pick one of the in
irregular ones so Ctrl C copy it and
paste it in here
if we wanted to extract any British
pound out of this then we could start to
write we could say British pound sign
you can see that we can now find it we
will use this search pattern in uipath
to extract the things out then I can say
then I want two digits for example
digits here and then two have two I can
either put in another d
but I'll check this one here now we have
two digits and I want to Dot and another
two digits so and these ones are Escape
both the digit sign and the DOT sign I
don't expect you to learn regex but I
expect you to do an effort in
understanding this because this will
improve your career if you don't already
know what regex is so please learn this
with me just do these things you will
already learn a lot after this lesson is
done so this is how we could extract any
British pound amount
but it will work up here but we'll have
a problem here because it cannot
determine whether it was a was or no
so let's just first pick the regular
price so what I will do here is that
I'll delete everything I want to save
and look at the start of a line and
maybe I want to say do I want the pound
sign or not I'll not use it because I
know that there will be a pound sign in
front of each of our prices but we can
easily say that we wanted it in here
I'll say parentheses and I'll have
something that is called a positive look
behind what this is is as datum can say
look behind something and let's move in
here to the equal sign let me just again
say what we do we have a parenthesis
question mark
then we have this
smaller than and then equal and then we
can say what do we want to look after
here I want to look after a pound sign
it will look like this we haven't picked
any character now but we created three
angles you can see now we look after a
pound sign we only wanted to and you can
see these ones here those ones are not
so good because we don't want the Russ
so in case we said we want only a pound
sign at the first of a line that will be
if a line starts then I move in front of
the pound signed then I'll make a hat
like this now we only have picked the
one where pound sign is the first one at
a line so very powerful move outside the
parentheses then we want to say what do
I want to look for well I want to look
for digits and dots so in hard brackets
like this hard bracket start hard
bracket end inside the Hard bracket I
will tell regex what I want to look for
I want to look for a digit and that is a
backwardslash digit now you can see that
it only finds one
but if I move outside the hard bracket
place a plus now it will find one or
more by the way the guide over here to
the right is impressive it helps you a
lot if you want to understand regular
expression and again I really want you
to understand it
so then we have the digits I also want a
DOT so if I go in here and after the D
I'll have a backward slash and a DOT now
we have a
so this is our expression for the first
one that is the regular price but it
will not pick up these so we will need
to make one from here and what we can do
here up here we can make a pipe that is
this sign called that will be an or in
regex so now we will say if you can't
find this then find something else and
here I want to look after a now
and what we'll do here is just to do
exactly like we did before so I will
have a positive look behind once more
like this and in here I'll have it now
but be careful these two white spaces
are not the same it might looks like two
spaces but for some reason there are a
little difference in it so just copy
from now all the way to these two white
spaces
then you want to go up here and paste it
in
and since we don't want the pound sign
we will say look behind a pound sign
now we have it you can see the only
anchors down here we can just copy this
we made this expression for the digits
or we can write it again let's practice
our skills so we'll have a hard bracket
backward slash that is for the digits
backward slash for the dots another hard
bracket and then we will have a plus
sign like this so now you can see with
this expression we both get if it's a
regular price but we also get if it is
an irregular price with the both a was
or a now
we will use this expression in uipath
so go copy it I know it's a lot but I
really hope you do it you will learn so
much
go back to uipath
then we want to go a little bit down
because what we want to do when we
extracted the data we want to make
another for each row in a data table and
here we need to be very careful because
we already have one here that is the one
that iterates to the products now we
will iterate through the extract data
table so find a for each row in data
table
and drag it in
here we will not use the same reference
name we already use this current row up
here so call it something else we could
call it q and line and here I want to
press Ctrl space that will be my
extracted data table so we want to do
something
and here I want to say I want to look
whatever is in the price and then I want
to
and make a new value to it based on my
regular expressions
so what you will do here is to find and
assign
and drag it in here and know that this
can be too much simply just pause or
rewind the video is designed for that
now I want to say for each one of these
lines that is referred to by the Q and
line so control space have it here then
I want to say what columns do I need to
update and again let me just show you
what we're actually doing we are
updating the price column so that's what
I'm going to do here and let me just go
here
I'll say that I'll have an item anime
mouse
parentheses quotation mark and then I'll
say price so this the left side is where
do I want to update something
and then the right side that will be
where I format what's already in there
this is quite small to make it a little
bit bigger you can go over to properties
here to the right and click this start
here we can make it a lot bigger because
now we want to apply regular Expressions
this is the search pattern that we just
have what we will do here press Ctrl
space I'll say system that again you
will get used to this and you will use
regular expression a lot
like this
I will say regex I'll say match find a
match then I'll have a parentheses then
I want to say where do I want to look
well I want to look in the current line
in the price what's what's in the
current rope that is the current line in
the price column so I'll just do this
one here I'll say current line and I'll
say current line and then I'll say
item then I'll say prevent a quotation
mark
price so now I'm looking for that then I
want to apply a regex pattern so go here
and then have a comma and now we'll have
a pattern
put in a quotation mark because the
pattern needs to go in a quotation mark
now you will press Ctrl V to paste in
your pattern that's it we have now our
regex pattern
what I just need to do is just to make
sure that this current line item is an
object so I just need to apply the
dotnet method to string that's it
now we're done I can click OK What's
Happening Here is that we're simply just
updating this extracted data table we're
giving a new value to what's in the
price and we do that with regular
expressions
and again I can close all of the things
that we don't need let's try to run it
and see that our regular expression
works and while we're here what do you
think about this course if you like it
please give it a thumbs up and let me
know in the comments what you want to
see next or how easy you think this is
what can I do better in this guide and
all the likes
so here we are iterating true that is
the first night then we will wait five
seconds and then we will have the Asics
Gel
there you go we can inspect the results
just to see that we have what we want
that's it you can see we now have all
the prices down here and we have the
prices nicely formatted we don't have
the British pound sign and we have the
correct price it isn't that beautiful
let's say we also want the before price
we had it before we could add a new
column here and then we could add the
before price if it's present sometimes
it's not it's only the goods that are on
sale
so if let me close this one again
we had it in the regular Expression
Builder so if I go here that is the was
price we can create we already had this
expression this this works fine when
this works fine we know that
now let us delete this and try to create
one that will extract the before price
if it's present
again you will use a positive look
behind like this and what do I want to
look for that will be the was
and here I can also take the bridge
pound sterling with me I'm not really
sure I got but make sure you copy it
because these two spaces are different
ones so it will not work if you just
press in spaces here
then we will have this hard bracket we
will have a digit Escape digit Escape D
and Escape dot dot a DOT if we don't
escape it it means a with then I'll have
a plus and we now have a before price
now go copy this expression and go back
to uipath here I want to apply it and I
want to do it before we are formatting
the actual price because we're using the
price so you want to have it before but
we want to add a column to this extract
data table so what you will do here is
to find add
data column and you will drag it in here
we will give our column a name and here
I will just call it before
the data table where I will extract the
column to that will be the extract data
table so control space
extract data table
now I want to again apply the regex I
want to apply the regex to the price
that will be this one that we're using
here again but I want to update the
before column
similar to this one oh fine sign you'll
take it step by step don't worry
I'll press control space I'll say
current line and Dot
item
parentheses quotation mark and then I'll
say before this is the column that I
want to update we could copy something
here but let's try to do it again you
will learn so much more
again we will have the right side a bit
expanded
control space then I want to say system
dot text
regular Expressions
regex dot match and now we want to refer
to the current line and I want to say
that
item
I want to say price
if things goes too fast I'll take a
little break now so this is the one that
I will look in and I'll have a color
quotation mark and I'll paste in my
regex
I'll take 10 seconds here
and in case you haven't checked out the
Discord community that is where we are
more than 5 000 RPA developers there's a
free invite for you and video guide how
to sign up in the comments it's totally
free and you can Network and solve
uipath problems with like-minded
Developers
now we have this regex pattern and now
we're updating the before column which
we added up here now if I click away we
don't have an arrow let us also close
this one here so we only have one
browser instance home shouldn't we go
test it to see that we can actually get
the before price out as well
again we are doing a lot of the same
things but you usually want to do that
as an RPA developer you want to see one
step work at a time
so soon we'll have the Asics Gel quick
search and then we will scrape these
things back it will take a little bit
longer now because now we are applying
these regex to the actual extraction so
we heard our runtime a bit but that's
fine
um that's how we want to do it here you
can see that now we have an arrow that
is because a column name before already
belong to this data table
and here that is because we need to
change the scope these are the
Expressions that the error messages that
we'll get and what happens here let me
just go out to the main
so what we want to do is to make sure
that when we extract this data table it
will get reset here in this body over
and over so let me just move this a bit
down and let me scroll down here now I
want to open up the variables so instead
of the do that will be this do here then
it will not get reset I want to get it
to make it reset after each for each one
of these iteration I can do that by only
defying defining it in the scope of the
body
so here just change it to body this will
solve the error
and what we will do here is just to see
if it works that's the nice thing about
your path it's like Sudoku we will get a
lot of problems like the selector and
these things Don't Panic it's it's very
very easy you always be able to maybe
not solve it the first time now you've
seen this then you know to the next time
but you will be able to Google it easily
stack Overflow you can ask on the
Discord again Ask in the comments here
on the YouTube video as the more
experienced developers if you do an
effort we all want to help you
if you just want projects to be solved
without trying of course you will get
little help on for example the Discord
but now you can see it works we should
also verify that it would indeed work so
this was just to change the scope a bit
and here's the last one
so what we have here is that X meister's
we now have the price and here we have
three sales and again we have it over
here we have a
the before price and we also had some
sales in the end there you go we have
now added a before column and we could
actually also drag out the before one
let's delete this we're almost done here
but we need to understand orchestrator
so what we do here is that we will just
minimize this let's remove the test
sequence so go to Project this was the
one that we practiced where we use the
date so you can just right click here
click delete
yes it's now gone it shouldn't be there
when we move this into production
I can now say I want to change it so I
have this input this product should be
scraped
open it
here now I want to change from product 1
to product 2. this one is just four
product five products instead of two
so and since we made such a great
automation that can easily be scaled we
can just change one thing then it will
be very easy for us
so we go up here and instead of just
reading sheet product one we can just
read sheet products two and our
automation will work
delete this and let's try to run the
robot again here I will Fast Forward
I'll click run now you will see that we
are extracting five products how fast
forward to the end
that's it we have now scraped five
different products and a lot of pages
let's inspect the result go to the
output
this last one here
here you see we have the Puma we have a
lot of things here
and we have the converse here
we have the editor shorts as Excel and a
Nike t-shirt you can see here we have
the price in a nice format but we had
this before in some weird format and
that is because we can just when we
created the column we could specify what
data we want in it
so in case we want to make it as nice as
the price I can just let me close this I
can go back to uipath then we go back to
the add data column go over to
properties and instead of this object we
can specify what it will if it's going
to look the other things we will just
have a string I will not run the robot
but in case you want to see it you can
just try to run it and verify it let me
know in the comments that this works
now we are done with our nice automation
but we still need a lot of things we
need to publish it to orchestrator and
this is very important because the
orchestrator is where we manage our
processes that is we can make it run
unattended that means that it can run in
the night on another computer
what you want to do here is to hit
publish over here
here we can give it a name I'll just go
with uipath beginners course that's the
name we gave it in the beginning so then
I can click next here we can publish it
to the personal workspace feed I want to
publish it to the orchestrator tenant
tenant process feed I want to make it
unattended later on so I'll process it
here I can click next or I can just
click publish now
so we are publishing our process up to
orchestrator this means that we can use
it in orchestrator when we want to
schedule things or whatever we want to
do then you can click ok
make sure you are connected to the
uipath assistant we did that in the
beginning but you can go down here
double click the uipath assistant and
still verify that you have this
agreement up here nothing will be
changed but in case you watch this video
during different days you just need to
verify that you have it here then we can
minimize it to three again
let us go to orchestrate them so and let
us just close down all this browser
thing again so I can close down the
regex and one thing that we could also
actually do to make sure that we don't
have these browser windows open when we
scrape whilst that remember we could use
this use browser over here
then we chose never to close it and here
I can say close it if it's opened by the
app browser so just make sure that when
we when we run this from orchestrator
this one will not be deployed to
deployed it's very easy just click
publish this one will be the new version
1.02 so I can click next this one will
be the pro the parameter that we said
before I can just click publish we now
published a new version this is how you
want to when you build new things in
your robots you can just publish it as a
new version so that's fine
I go back here to go to orchestrator you
want to navigate to
cloud.uipath.com this address up here
then I want to press enter and this will
take you to this Rampage you might have
it open if you watch this video in one
go
so then I'll click Orchestra
in my workspace folder which you see
here that is a personal attended folder
we want to create a new folder where we
can use unattended robots so here I
click tenant
I now click folders I'll click this plus
here and here I'll make a folder called
animations.nog I'll use the 10 inch
package feeds that is fine I'll click
create
then I'll choose manage access
you want to manage your user usually
it's the one with email in here's mine I
click this 3D here click edit
no role selected go down here allow to
be automation user that's it click next
click next once more here you want to
make sure that this allow unattended
robots to run automation as this user is
ticked so if it looks like this make
sure it's ticked we will go down here
and use a specific Windows user account
add the credentials below
so here to find the domain you'll go to
the start menu type in command prompt
sometimes it will not get it
automatically from here that's why we
found it here here I'll just type in who
am I again start menu CMD enter this
will give you this one this is our
domain
let me copy this one here we'll see copy
it here the password that is your
Windows password I put in mine
now you can click update
that's it let me just close this one
here now we go to machines
and click these three dots edit machine
add an unattended license to this
machine I'll click update
then you want to go down to anesians and
then we want to assign this machine to
this folder so I click these three dots
settings assign machines
there it is Market leg update
that's it
now we can add our process
so still in the anishin snog make sure
you click here and you go down here then
you want to click automations
click add a process
here we will find the process that we
created the UI path beginner's course we
have the 1.02 that is the version that
we gave it
here I'll click next
we don't have any packages along with
our robot so I'll just click next once
more that's it we just go with the
default properties if we don't specify
name it will just be called uipath
beginners I can click create
just click close for now this is how it
looks when you go there so when you
click your folder you will find your
processes in automation processes
to run it as an unintended robot you can
click these three dots add a trigger
here you can schedule it that could be
every night at two o'clock or we can use
a queue that is when we add items to a
queue then we can kick off our robot in
case you want to learn about Q and A
reframework that is the template that
uipath uses when you want to scale
robots in for example a company then you
should click this video RP in the right
corner that will teach you everything
it's an advanced video but it will take
you through each step so just like here
anyway we will not use a scheduled robot
for this time we will just see that this
works so I click cancel here
I can just kick things off here I can
start this little play here here you'll
see that the runtime type is unattended
it will just take any account in any
machine that's fine we only have one so
here I will click Start then we are
running our automation there you go you
have now created an unattended robot
wasn't that easy
and we don't want to see this
um
to the end
I will fast forward to the end just to
show you that we had this column right
and then make sure you stick because we
will talk a lot about the best books and
the best uipath resources as this finish
there you go we have ran our unattended
robot let's also inspect the actual
results here and see that we formatted
it very nicely so if I go down here now
you can see that the before column has
been formatted nice we just change the
type argument I just visited my
bookshelf here behind me here and here
with all my best uipath books let me go
to room and these are books that if you
want to read if you like reading I like
to take them to public transportation to
the beach when I travel you can learn so
much from them let me go to room one by
one and there's a list if you want to
buy them Below in the description
first of all the coding language in
uipath that is visual basic.net this
book is the absolute best it will not
only teach you visual basic.net but also
object oriented programming
it's written by Jesse Liberty one of my
old time idols
at some point you won't get certified in
uipath this guide was enough to get you
started you learned some advanced
concepts but you still need some if you
want to get certified this books hasn't
it is a very nice egg to set a rundown
of all the important things that you
want to focus on if you want to get
certified by the way this associate
certification is the first certification
that is the one that you want to take as
a beginner or maybe like you need to
have I think three months of experience
I'll recommend then you want to go with
the advanced ones later on
if you want to use intelligent document
processing that is using AI to take data
out of your documents this book is for
you this is not a beginner's book so
definitely read it if you want to get
inspired or want to go Advanced it is
great because it's examples so you can
just literally just open it open your
computer and learn from it it also has a
nice chapter about integrating chatbots
into uipath
the clean coder nothing to do with RPA
and uipath but still the best book if
you should only buy one book it should
be this why it teach you the core of
software development principles and
these ones apply to RPA development as
well
it will prepare your processes to the
Future you that means when you come back
to your UI path flows you need to
structure them that was renaming then
commenting them documenting them to make
sure that you can easily see what's
going on and also the future colleague
of you so that's the principle here SQL
we use that ton srpa developers we use
it in Excel to make queries and we use
it with databases
as you remember and being an RPA
developer is a lot about taking data out
of system a and transferring them to
system B in our example we did it from
Excel to a web page and back from the
web page to another Excel here we can
also use databases this book is it
teaches you SQL I will say 10 minutes is
very optimistic I'll might say two days
or something you'll learn all the basics
and that's it with RPA development you
don't need to mask all these surrounding
Technologies you just need to have a
brief recognition of all of them like we
had on regex because you usually just
need the basics and if it's not enough
you can Google it stack overflow you can
go on the Discord the I love automation
Discord there's also a link down here or
you can ask a much more experienced
developer at your company
the intelligent automation book is
written by Ian barking my friend and
this is not why I recommend this this is
a very good one where we take each Topic
in the intelligent automation that is
computer vision Big Data machine
learning all the things that we can
apply to make our robots thinking seeing
and talking chatbots and these things is
explained in here it's not an advanced
book probably your mother can understand
it and that's the strength of it it's
easily read but it gives you a nice
knowledge especially if you want to
crack uipath job interviews this book is
for you in the end there's also a use
case section where you can get
inspiration
then we have my favorite RPA book that
is the robotic process automation
handbook it's written by Tom toley
um it's not again not an advanced book
but it teaches you a lot about the
ecosystem the pipeline the RPA pipeline
everything you need to know to get a
nice understanding about RPA there's
practical part in this book as well I
would not recommend it that is outdated
but it's easily worth it just for
overview here so the last book I have it
on my Kindle that is written by my
friend Aaron Kuma it's about supporting
an administrating UI path ecosystems
and it's a lot for the support people
the it UPS and the likes but it's also
for you that want to know more about the
technical aspects of you
I'm not giving it five stars because
Aaron is my friend but generally because
I like this book again it's cheap and
it's easily written the whole book list
is in the video description below
and I'll definitely recommend go check
that one out the best UI path resources
those ones are right here at YouTube and
here are my three favorites
tutorial by mukeshkala mucus color is a
UI path most valuable professional he is
very skilled he will teach you all the
best practices he make long videos you
can watch them like you watch this video
definitely go check his channel out
the next one that is uipath with Diego
is from Denmark like I am I don't know
him personally but he seems like a nice
guy he make videos about Advanced UI
path Concepts the final one that is this
channel make sure you subscribe to the
channel to get all my new RPA uipath
videos
with that said I want you to check my
Discord out here we Network and solve
uipath problems with more than 5 000 RPA
developers it's totally free to join
check this video there's an invitation
for you in the video and as a guide for
