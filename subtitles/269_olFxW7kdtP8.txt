hi guys i'm anirban from simply learn
and today i will be giving you a
tutorial on one of the most talked about
topics in the world of technology and
that is machine learning
i'm sure that if you are watching this
video you must have heard about machine
learning somewhere or the other and yes
it is quite an intriguing topic
this video will act as a supplement for
the ones who know the basics of machine
learning and are aware of where it is
being used and how it is being used for
the ones who are completely new to this
you don't have to worry
we will be brushing up the basics as
well
so to start off with let's have a look
at the agenda
first we'll look into a life without
machine learning
then we'll move into a life with machine
learning
then we'll try to understand what is
machine learning actually
then we look into the types of machine
learning we'll talk about the right
machine learning solutions
then we'll move into the different
algorithms that machine learning has
let's talk about a life without machine
learning
for someone who doesn't know anything
about machine learning or artificial
intelligence he or she might think that
it is only being used in robots or
machines and stuff which is actually
true as ported by most of the sci-fi
movies nowadays
but you wouldn't believe how much more
machine learning is giving us how much
of it we are using in our daily lives
let's say you need information on any
random topic say a computer
the first place you would check would
definitely be google right
it would collect all the information on
the word you search for and present it
to you according to relevance if there
was no google you would have to do it in
a very hard way that is by going through
tens or hundreds of books and articles
even after which you won't find the
answer
if we go back four to five years facial
recognition would be a thing only showed
in movies like mission impossible or
terminator or any of the sci-fi movies
you pick
but machine learning has made it
possible for facebook and instagram to
use this feature for your benefits you
don't have to go through the trouble of
tagging every single person present in a
picture that you have posted
facebook will automatically recognize
the people in the photo and tag them for
you
that saves a lot of time for you doesn't
it
also siri cortana iris all of them would
not be there to help you if there was no
machine learning
now that we know life would be a lot
more difficult without machine learning
let's look into the things that are run
by machine learning and we are using
them on our daily basis
let's enter the world of gaming ps4s and
xboxes have introduced virtual reality
glasses which brings a whole new level
of detail into gaming
every time your head moves in real world
it replicates the movement in the
virtual world providing an excellent
gaming experience
then there is gesture control gaming
where in machine learning tracks your
body movement and makes a corresponding
movement in the game
finally in the game fifa your opponent
tends to adapt based on the kind of
strategy or gameplay you follow
that is again done by machine learning
i'm sure you must have shopped a lot
from amazon so let's look into some of
the places amazon makes use of machine
learning
let's say you buy a formal t-shirt on
amazon now as you buy it it suggests you
formal shoes ties blazers and apparels
that go with what you have bought
that's the recommendation system powered
by machine learning again
the price on every product that you see
on amazon is varying every moment based
on demand
that's being done by machine learning
algorithms
then comes customer segmentation
customer segmentation is one of the most
crucial thing for all the e-commerce
platforms machine learning helps them
differentiate between customers based on
what they buy how frequent are they and
their reviews
this helps the companies to make sure
that their customers are taken care of
and the needs are being fulfilled
now let's talk about an app
that you use on a daily basis to reach
office on time
yes it's uber gaps once you have
traveled with uber you must have noticed
that it suggests you the places you
might want to go based on your previous
journeys when you are taking a share how
does the app make sure that the cab you
get is travelled by the same route you
want to travel in
there are so many factors like the
distance the traffic the ratings all of
it is taken care of by machine learning
for the past five minutes we have been
talking about how machine learning is
improving our lives where all it is
being used i have probably said machine
learning 100 times already
i think it's about time that i tell you
what machine learning actually is
let's take an ordinary system that you
currently are using it can't do much
except from the basic operations that
you already know about
now
let's add artificial intelligence or for
a layman's point of view let's give the
same machine the power to think on its
own
that is what machine learning basically
is
it's an application of artificial
intelligence that provides systems the
ability to learn on their own and
improve from experience without being
programmed externally
so if your computer had machine learning
may be able to play the difficult parts
of a game for you or probably solve a
complicated mathematical equation for
you
that could be really helpful
let's dive in a little deeper and see
how machine learning works
let's say you provide a system with the
input data that carries the photos of
various kinds of fruits now you want the
system to figure out what are the
different fruits and group them
accordingly so what the system does it
analyzes the input data
then it tries to find patterns patterns
like shapes size and color
based on these patterns the system will
try to predict the different types of
fruit and segregate them
finally it keeps track of all such
decisions it took in the process to make
sure it's learning the next time you ask
the same system to predict and segregate
the different types of fruits
it won't have to go through the entire
process again
that's how machine learning works
now let's look into the types of machine
learning
machine learning is primarily of three
types first one is supervised machine
learning as the name suggests you have
to supervise your machine learning while
you train it to work on its own it
requires labeled training data
next up is unsupervised learning wherein
there will be training data but it won't
be labeled
finally there's reinforcement learning
wherein the system learns on its own
let's talk about all these types in
detail
let's try to understand how supervised
learning works look at the pictures very
very carefully the monitor depicts the
model or the system that we are going to
train
this is how the training is done
we provide a data set that contains
pictures of a kind of a fruit say an
apple
then we provide another data set which
lets the model know that these pictures
were that of a fruit called apple
this ends the training phase
now
what we will do is we provide a new set
of data which only contains pictures of
apple
now here comes the fun part the system
can actually tell you what fruit it is
and it will remember this and apply this
knowledge in future as well that's how
supervised learning works you are
training the model to do a certain kind
of an operation on its own
this kind of a model is generally used
into filtering spam mails from your
email accounts as well
yes
surprise aren't you
so let's move on to unsupervised
learning now let's say we have a data
set which is cluttered in this case we
have a collection of pictures of
different fruits we feed this data to
the model and the model analyzes the
data to figure out patterns in it
in the end it categorizes the photos
into three types as you can see in the
image based on their similarities
so you provide the data to the system
and let the system do the rest of the
work simple isn't it
this kind of a model is used by flipkart
to figure out the products that are well
suited for you
honestly speaking this is my favorite
type of machine learning out of all the
three and this type has been widely
shown in most of the sci-fi movies
lately
let's find out how it works
imagine a newborn baby
you put a burning candle in front of the
baby
the baby does not know that if it
touches the flame its fingers might get
burned
so it does that anyway and gets hurt
the next time you put that candle in
front of the baby it will remember what
happened the last time and would not
repeat what it did
that's exactly how reinforcement
learning works
we provide the machine with a data set
wherein we ask it to identify a
particular kind of a fruit in this case
an apple
so what it does as a response it tells
us that it's a mango
but as we all know it's a completely
wrong answer so as a feedback we tell
the system that it's wrong it's not a
mango it's an apple what it does it
learns from the feedback and keeps that
in mind
when the next time when we ask a same
question it gives us the right answer it
is able to tell us that it's actually an
apple that is a reinforced response so
that's how reinforcement learning works
it learns from its mistakes and
experiences
this model is used in games like prince
of persia or assassin's creed or fifa
wherein the level of difficulty
increases as you get better with the
games just to make it more clear for you
let's look at a comparison between
supervised and unsupervised learning
firstly the data involved in case of
supervised learning is labeled as we
mentioned in the examples previously
we provide the system with a photo of an
apple and let the system know that this
is actually an apple
that is called label data so the system
learns from the label data and makes
future predictions
now unsupervised learning does not
require any kind of label data because
its work is to look for patterns in the
input data and organize it
the next point is that you get a
feedback in case of supervised learning
that is once you get the output the
system tends to remember that and uses
it for the next operation
that does not happen for unsupervised
learning
and the last point is that supervised
learning is mostly used to predict data
whereas unsupervised learning is used to
find out hidden patterns or structures
in data
i think this would have made a lot of
things clear for you regarding
supervised and unsupervised learning
now let's talk about a question that
everyone needs to answer before building
a machine learning model
what kind of a machine learning solution
should we use
yes you should be very careful with
selecting the right kind of solution for
your model because if you don't you
might end up losing a lot of time energy
and processing cost
i won't be naming the actual solutions
because you guys aren't familiar with
them yet
so we will be looking at it based on
supervised unsupervised and
reinforcement learning
so let's look into the factors that
might help us select the right kind of
machine learning solution
first factor is the problem statement
describes the kind of model you will be
building or as the name suggests it
tells you what the problem is
for example let's say the problem is to
predict the future stock market prices
so for anyone who is new to machine
learning would have trouble figuring out
the right solution
but with time and practice you will
understand that for a problem statement
like this
solution based on supervised learning
would work the best for obvious reasons
then comes the size quality and nature
of the data if the data is cluttered you
go for unsupervised if the data is very
large and categorical we normally go for
supervised learning solutions
finally we choose the solution based on
their complexity
as for the problem statement wherein we
predict the stock market prices it can
also be solved by using reinforcement
learning
but that would be very very difficult
and time consuming unlike supervised
learning
algorithms are not types of machine
learning
in the most simplest language they are
methods of solving a particular problem
so the first kind of method is
classification which falls under
supervised learning
classification is used when the output
you are looking for is a yes or no or in
the form a or b or true or false like if
a shopkeeper wants to predict if a
particular customer will come back to
his shop or not he will use a
classification algorithm
the algorithms that fall under
classification are decision tree knife
base random forest logistic regression
and
knn the next kind is regression
this kind of a method is used when the
predicted data is numerical in nature
like if the shopkeeper wants to predict
the price of a product based on its
demand it would go for regression the
last method is clustering
clustering is a kind of unsupervised
learning again it is used when the data
needs to be organized
most of the recommendation system used
by flipkart amazon etc make use of
clustering
another major application of it is in
search engines the search engines study
your old search history to figure out
your preferences and provide you the
best search results
one of the algorithms that fall under
clustering is k-means
now that we know the various algorithms
let's look into four key algorithms that
are used widely
we will understand them with very simple
examples
the four algorithms that we will try to
understand are k nearest neighbor
linear regression
decision tree and naive bayes
let's start with our first machine
learning solution k nearest neighbor k
near its neighbor is again a kind of a
classification algorithm as you can see
on the screen the similar data points
form clusters
the blue one
the red one
and the green one there are three
different clusters
now if we get a new and unknown data
point it is classified based on the
cluster closest to it or the most
similar to it
k in k n is the number of nearest
neighboring data points we wish to
compare the unknown data with
let's make it clear with an example
let's say we have three clusters in a
cost to durability graph
first cluster is of footballs
the second one is of tennis balls
and the third one is of basketballs
from the graph we can say that the cost
of footballs is high and the durability
is less
the cost of tennis balls is very less
but the durability is high and the cost
of basketballs
is as high as the durability
now let's say we have an unknown data
point
we have a black spot which can be one
kind of the balls but we don't know what
kind it is
so what we'll do we'll try to classify
this using knn
so if we take k is equal to 5 we draw a
circle keeping the unknown data point at
the center and we make sure that we have
five
balls inside that circle in this case we
have a football a basketball and three
tennis balls
now since we have the highest number of
tennis balls inside the circle
the classified ball would be a tennis
ball
so that's how k nearest neighbor
classification is done
linear regression is again a type of
supervised learning algorithm this
algorithm is used to establish linear
relationship between variables one of
which would be dependent and the other
one would be independent
like if we want to predict the weight of
a person based on his height
weight would be the dependent variable
and height would be independent
let's have a look at it through an
example
let's say we have a graph here showing a
relationship between height and weight
of a person
let's put the y-axis as h
and the
x-axis as weight
so the green dots are the various data
points
these green dots are the data points
and d
is the mean squared error that is the
perpendicular distances from the line to
the data points
are the error values
this error tells us how much the
predicted values vary from the original
value
let's ignore this blue line for a while
so let's say if this is our regression
line
you can see the distance from all the
data points from this line is very high
so if we take this line as a regression
line
the error in the prediction will be too
high
so
in this case the model will not be able
to give us a good prediction
let's say we draw another regression
line here like this
even in this case you can see that the
perpendicular distance of the data
points from the line is very high
so the error value will still come as
high as the last one
so this model will also not be able to
give us a good prediction
so what to do
so finally we draw a line which is this
blue line
so here we can see that the distance of
the data points from the line is very
less
relative to the other two lines we drew
so the value of d for this line will be
very less
so in this case if we take
any value on the x-axis the
corresponding value on the y-axis will
be our prediction
and
given the fact that the d is very low
our prediction should be good also
this is how regression works
we draw a line a regression line that is
in such a way that the value of d is the
least eventually giving us good
predictions
this algorithm that is decision tree is
a kind of an algorithm you can very
strongly relate to
it uses a kind of a branching method to
realize the problem and make decisions
based on the conditions
let's take this graph as an example
imagine yourself sitting at home getting
bored you feel like going for a swim
what you do is you check if it's sunny
outside so that's your first condition
if the answer to that condition is yes
you go for a swim if it's not sunny then
the next question you would ask yourself
is if it's raining outside so that's
condition number two if it's actually
raining you cancel the plan and stay
indoors if it's not raining then you
would probably go outside and have a
walk
so that's the final node
that's how decision tree algorithm works
you probably use this every day it
realizes a problem and then takes the
decisions based on the answers to every
conditions
nybis algorithm is mostly used in cases
where a prediction needs to be done on a
very large data set it makes use of
conditional probability
conditional probability is the
probability of an event say a happening
given that another event b has already
happened
this algorithm is most commonly used in
filtering spam mails in your email
account
let's say you receive a mail
the model goes through your old spam
mail records
then it uses space theorem to predict if
the present mail is a spam mail or not
so pc of a is the probability of even c
occurring when a has already occurred
b
a of c is the probability of event a
occurring when c has already occurred
and b c
is the probability of event c occurring
and p a is a probability of event a
occurring
let's try to understand naive bayes with
a better example
nybase can be used to determine on which
days to play cricket
based on the probabilities of a day
being rainy windy or sunny the model
tells us if a match is possible
if we consider all the weather
conditions to be event a for us
and the probability of a match being
possible even c
so the model applies the probabilities
of event a and c into the bayes theorem
and predicts if a game of cricket is
possible on a particular day or not
in this case if the probability of c of
a is more than 0.5 we can be able to
play a game of cricket if it's less than
0.5 we won't be able to do that that's
how naive algorithm works
