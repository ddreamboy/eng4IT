what is going on guys welcome back in
today's video we're going to learn how
to use speech recognition in python so
let's get right into it
all right now in order to use speech
recognition in python we need to install
two libraries and the first one has the
creative name
speech recognition so we need to say pip
3 install
speech recognition like that and the
second one is a little bit more cryptic
it is
p y t t s x three and i don't even know
what that stands for
um but this module this p y t t
s x three module is based on pi audio
and just
a little warning here pi audio is not uh
always trivial to install so sometimes
you're going to have some errors pi
audio can uh can be difficult to install
let's put it that way
now usually all you need to do is or
actually it's automatically installed if
you don't have any mistakes by just
installing this library
but usually you just say pip install and
then pi audio
um or pip3 install pi audio on linux you
sometimes have to do
sudo apt at least on
on debian based version sudo apt install
and then
python 3 dash pi
audio and sometimes you're going to have
some errors on windows or on linux then
you might have to install the wheel
files manually
uh or to use the dash dash user tech and
so on
however i think this falls into the
category of googling so
watch the one video that i that i
uploaded a couple of
weeks or days ago which is the art of
googling as a programmer or
googling as a superpower i can't
remember the exact title
there you can learn how to google
properly and you just
if you encounter some mistakes while
installing these libraries just google
and you're going to find uh your way to
the solution so
then we're just going to create a new
python file and here we're going to
import
first of all speech recognition but
we're going to use an underscore here
because even though we install
speech recognition without any blanks or
underscores we're going to have to
import speech underscore recognition
and then we're going to also import
pytt sx3
so those are the two libraries that
we're going to import here
and then we're going to build a
recognizer so this is going to be our
object we're going to say recognizer
equals and this is part of speech
recognition so speech recognition dot
recognizer
with a capital r and this is just going
to be our object that is going to
um to make sure that it understands what
we're saying into the microphone
then we're going to have an endless loop
so while true and then we're going to
try something and if this doesn't work
we're going to have an accept block here
and some error handling or just skipping
the current iteration here
um and now what we're going to do here
is we're going to say
with speech recognition dot
microphone so we're going to use a
microphone as an input here
with that as mic
we're going to say recognizer
dot adjust for ambient noise
the source of this is the microphone and
duration we're going to set this to 0.2
so that it recognizes when we start
talking and stop talking
and then we're just going to say audio
equals recognizer.listen
i'm going to listen to the microphone
here and
then we're just going to extract the
text so we're going to say text equals
and then we're going to say recognizer
dot recognize and here we can use the
source so we can use bing we can use ibm
and
so on we can use google which is what
we're going to use here so you just have
to pick the source
and the language and all that so here
you can see in the documentation that
you can pick a language
and set some other parameters like
grammar and so on but we're just going
to go for google
and we're going to leave it at the
default language which is english
and then we're going to have to pass the
audio data to this function so we're
going to say recognizer dot recognize
google
and here we're going to pass the audio
source
or the audio itself and then we're just
going to say text
equals text dot lower so that we don't
have
any uh cases that we don't like
and we're going to print the text so
we're going to say recognized
and the text here and we need to make
this an f-string
otherwise this is not going to work
and this is actually it now what happens
if we get some value error because this
happens from time to time
so if we get a speech recognition dot
unknown value error
uh i don't know exactly when this
happens but if it happens
it's mostly you know it's not a big deal
we can just
skip the whole thing and start start
from scratch so we're just going to
basically copy
this uh initialization here
we're going to indent this and then
we're just going to continue
so basically what we're doing is if we
get some error and we don't know how to
proceed we're just going to set up the
whole thing again
and we're going to skip this iteration
we're going to start all over until we
get this same error again so this is a
very basic speech recognition script
so now we have the script on the desktop
and we're going to give it a try by
running cmd and navigating to the
desktop so cd desktop and then just
python main dot py
now as i'm talking here it's going to
recognize what i'm saying so let's just
wait for
for the result
as you can see here recognized now as
i'm talking here it's going to recognize
what i'm saying so let's just wait for
for the result so even if i'm making a
mistake while talking it's going to
recognize that
and now we should get a pretty long
sentence
yeah as you can see now it's not uh it's
not perfect i don't know
if it makes any mistakes here but i'm
certainly making mistakes while i'm
talking so we're going to see some
interesting results when i stop talking
here
yeah there you go so this is basically
the speech recognition script and you
can use this of course
to make a voice assistant for example
now i have a video on this channel about
an intelligent chatbot
about a virtual assistant and you can
combine this with
this speech recognition and make it a
voice assistant and maybe i'm going to
make a video on that
in the future so let me know in the
comment section down below if you want
to see such a project
and you can combine this with all sorts
of things you can automate your home if
you have some access to your
light bulbs for example or to a smart
fridge or a smart toaster for example
you can just say something to the script
and then
uh the script recognizes okay this guy
wants me to
start the coffee machine for example and
this can be done with this script
