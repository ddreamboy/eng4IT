- When we're talking
about video surveillance.
I mean, I can imagine
why it would be appealing
to attackers, but are
there certain aspects of it
that make us particularly vulnerable?
- You have seen the movies, right?
- Yeah. (chuckles)
- So, what you see in the
movies is actually not that far
from the real world.
So, attacking the surveillance system
is the first thing a criminal will do.
The surveillance systems
are in the frontline.
- Do you feel like you're on
the frontline of a big threat
or what's it like when
you're kind of on the ground?
- You can say that our customers
put a huge amount of trust
in Milestone because they use our software
as a security control to make sure
that they can actually
investigate criminal behavior
on their premises with the cameras
and the video surveillance system.
So yeah, I feel responsible
for our customers' security, of course.
- Do you feel like a movie star?
You mentioned the movies.
- (laughs) Maybe not so much,
but I can't help feel responsible
for the wellbeing and
security of our customers.
- So, if you were to look
at the current landscape
of cyber security, what do you think
are some of the biggest threats today?
- When I think about the top three,
what immediately comes to my
mind is ransomware and malware.
I mean, we hear about it every
single day, more or less,
new ransomware attacks.
And some statistics even
say that every 14 seconds
there is a new victim
for ransomware attacks.
The downtime you have in your business,
rebuilding of all the systems et cetera,
it has enormous financial impact.
- What about endpoint, I
know that's also an issue?
- Yeah endpoint security is
also a huge thing as I see it,
because the way we have moved
in the past 10, 15 years,
where we have moved,
a lot from our on-premise
system, in closed networks,
we are now, everything is on the internet.
We are using cloud services.
We are using remote
workstations, we work from home.
The attack surface has
dramatically increased
over the past many years.
So I would say that is
probably number two on my list.
And the third is the very
very good old phishing.
Even though we have a lot of knowledge
about how to deal with it,
we train people et cetera,
but it's still just keeps coming.
- Just when you mentioned training.
I mean, I imagine that's one method
of trying to counter
cybersecurity threats,
but just in terms of solutions,
what are some of the options
that are available today?
- Yeah, when it comes to the solution
is really a two edged sword as I see it.
There are two very very
very important factors.
First of all, it is, and
the most important one,
security awareness and employee training,
though, that is the most important one.
Then we have the second one,
which is the security policies,
and the technical
controls we have in place.
- Maybe if we're looking
at that in practice,
if I'm an employee, say,
are there certain, just good practices,
just things that I should be doing
in order to protect the organization,
and I guess myself and my reputation?
- Yeah, and so you need to be aware,
and you need to be skeptical
when you look at contents
of mails to determine whether
it is a phishing mail.
And be aware of what links you click on.
You might be thinking
that is that really right?
And you need to have that
common sense of skepticism
to evaluate whether these
actions you are asked to do
are sound or not.
- I know myself, I've, sometimes
you get like a text message
and it comes from your bank.
It looks as though, like
it's with the same messages,
how did they do that, do we know?
(both laughing)
- That there are many, I don't think that
we should go into all the
technical details about this.
But you're absolutely right,
the phishing mails today
can really look trustworthy
when you look at them.
But there are always a science
that will show they are scams.
- These things like typos or?
- Yeah, but the typos actually,
it's actually a very deliberate.
You have read these weird
spelled phishing mails.
The reason why they put them in there
is to lure away the
people who can actually,
you can say that can actually recognize
these kinds of things immediately.
So we have people who will
not fall into the trap,
because when you start a
phishing campaign, for example,
or we also had these scam calls,
we have different kinds of things,
where you are trying to
lure people into something
then you start up a dialogue,
and then eventually you get
the trust of the victim,
and then you can start
extorting money et cetera.
So, the bad spells is
actually just to lure a way
those people who will never
fall into the trap anyways.
So that is very very targeted.
It is not because those
who are creating these
phishing mails are bad at writing.
So that is very deliberate.
- Okay, all right.
That makes me feel a little bit better
that I might just spot them.
You mentioned about, was
it called spear phishing?
This is where you're specifically...
- This email looks like it
comes from the CTO to the PA,
"Please immediately transfer
some money to some account
because we are closing a
big deal or we are in..."
- It's always urgent.
- Yes it's a very urgent,
but this is about,
the spear phishing part is about where
you mention specific names
and you make it look like specific people.
- And I mean, how much can this escalate?
Is it just to keep piling the pressure on,
or do they use multiple methods
of trying to lure someone?
- They try new methods
all the time, of course.
And there are actually lying
a lot of research behind,
or you can say information gathering
behind these kinds of the
spear phishing attacks,
where the attackers really do
a lot of information gathering
around the company and the people in there
to make these phishing attacks
as legitimate looking as possible, so.
- Okay, so it's the
opposite of the typos...
- Yeah that is the opposite
of the typos, yes, yes.
- And we started this
conversation talking about
the rise in ransomware,
you mentioned as one of
the areas of threats.
Just in terms of your take
on this kind of slightly,
maybe controversial or questionable area.
There's always the question
when you're under attack
as a company, being asked to pay a ransom,
the money is probably not
going to be going to good use.
What's your take on this situation?
- The approach should be, in my opinion,
that you invest heavily into preventing
the situation for occurring
in the first place,
and making sure that if you
are hit, when you're hit,
that it has the minimum
amount of damage it can do.
And there are procedures,
there are best practices
in place for that.
The problem is that of
course it cost money.
It cost a lot of money to have
these kinds of plans,
disaster recovery plans,
business continuity plans,
and all these kinds of how to
react when disaster hits you.
It cost a lot of money.
And, it is easy to cut on that budget
and say, ah, it probably
works well, okay let's see,
because you don't get immediate,
you can say return of investment
on money spent on security.
You only get it when you
are attacked, of course.
So that would be my approach to this.
And also because when organizations
are not properly secured
and do not probably have these plans
to limit the damage done,
and ideally prevent it,
it is also just encouraging
these criminal guys
to do more ransomware attacks.
Because when there is a market
for criminal activities,
of course it will continue to be there.
So, we won't get this solved until
companies, organizations actually make it
a bad business to be
a ransomware attacker.
- Prevention is crucial.
- Prevention is the best
way to do this, yeah.
- Carsten, that's all we have time for.
Thank you very much for joining me today.
- Okay, thank you for having
me, it has been a pleasure.
Thank you very much.
