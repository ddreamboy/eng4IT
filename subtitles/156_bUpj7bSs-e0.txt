Hi I'm Gary. Sentiment analysis, part 
of natural language programming or NLP,  
is very common very popular, and a very powerful 
tool. For example we can see the sentiment the  
positive or negative sentiment of someone when 
they interact with a help desk many help desks  
use NLP to see how their customers interact 
with their staff and their staff interact  
customers also social media, we might be able 
to tell how positive or negative people are  
talking about our brand but let me show you how 
simple it is to do sentiment analysis in Python
first of all on my screen you're going to see my 
data these are media releases I'm going to create  
sentiments analysis on these media releases these 
are media releases from various state governments  
in Australia over the last few years Health 
media releases health related media releases  
so I'm going to look at the sentiment of 
this text column okay I've got State I've  
got the date I've got very it's a few years it's 
several thousand rows it's not a huge data set  
so what I'm wanting to get to what I'll show 
what we'll get to so that's what I'm going to  
analyze for sentiment I want to know how positive 
and negative every one of these media releases  
are every single one of these rows so just to 
show you where we're actually going with this  
we're going to get to here so you'll notice 
it's the same as before that's the text I'm  
going to analyze that text column and we 
can get we can see whether it's positive  
or negative now the various things that happen 
in this analysis it gives a positive score how  
positive or what it is each each of these text 
rows for example how neutral or how negative  
is it and a compounded or an overall score 
so generally we would look at this overall  
score so for example anything above zero zero to 
one would be positive and anything from zero to  
minus one would be negative so here you can see 
that's minus 0.8 so that's a negative sentiment  
um critical workers from certain sectors sectors 
isolating as close contacts will be and on it goes  
so that was deemed as negative and so on so let's 
see how we do this I'm going to go across two  
Jupiter notebook I do have if you haven't used 
Jupiter before if you need to install python I  
do have a a tutorial and I'll leave I'll create 
a link for that also the script I'm running uh  
in this video I will in the description of the 
video I'll create a link where you can copy this  
um uh sorry this the script and use it if 
you if you want to so we're going to run this  
let me just go through What's Happening Here 
so we're saying first thing we're going to do  
is import NLTK that's an NLP or natural language 
programming package in Python we're going to be  
using the VADER lexicon. VADER is what does the 
sentiment analysis which is part of the NLTK and  
we're going to use Pandas so good old Pandas which 
if you're a data scientist or data analyst you  
you probably use Pandas a lot if you use Python 
it creates data frame or we can work with data  
frames let's put it that way so we're going to 
load up the CSV file into the Pandas data frame  
I'm then going to do a little bit of work 
on it for example I'm going to drop in now  
or drop all columns all with a date column is 
empty I'm going to drop those I just want to  
get rid of those empty empty columns that's just 
something that's probably a good practice to do  
and then also going to define the various 
data types you don't necessarily need to  
do this but I will just to show you so I've got 
a date column a text column and a state column  
date is day text is text or a string 
and a state is actually categorical
in Pandas particularly if you're working 
if you're a researcher for example and  
working with large data sets several 
million rows for example that would  
destroy Excel for example you're going to use 
far less memory if you define the data types  
generally what happens is using Pandas 
it Imports the data as an object type  
some string and you'll notice that you will have 
me or you may well have memory problems but if  
you define the data types your memory usage 
will go down so I've just gotten the habit of  
doing it so I'm going to do it in this case you 
don't need to do it with smaller lots of data  
so let me just run this and we should see because 
I've said here print the head show the first few  
in the last few rows we can see here um I've got 
it's not quite Lan but date I've got text and  
I've got State okay so I've loaded it up now we're 
going to create that magic we're going to run that  
sentiment analysis and create those extra fields 
in my Excel file CSV file saver to a CSV file  
so I'm going to go through it very very quickly 
we're going to load up the analyzer we're then  
going to create three sorry four different columns 
compound negative neutral and positive and VADER  
is going to calculate that for us the different 
scores based on the text column in our data
um my different columns I'm going to create 
as well a sentiment column because I want to  
just summarize these so what I'm going to say 
is if the positive score is greater than 0.5
then make it positive sorry if the sentiment 
score is greater than 0.5 add positive into  
the sentiment field if in the sentiment field the 
compound value is less than 0. negative 0.05 then  
add negative it's just a very quick way of then 
seeing positive and negative scores and we'll  
just print it out to the screen and we'll save 
it to a CSV file ending in demo.csv just so I  
can show you that it's done so let's run this now 
this does take a little bit of time to run for the  
amount of data that I have which is um uh uh 2000 
204 rows it'll take I'm guessing three minutes or  
so on my computer which is pretty slow if you have 
several million uh rows it'll obviously take a lot  
longer it's quite a complex thing but I'll get 
back as soon as this is finished we'll carry on  
okay so the sentiment analysis or the script 
has now run and you can see here I've printed to  
the screen the first value there 52 is there 52 
neutral comments 1572 positive and 580 negative  
so in general the media releases at the health 
departments in in these uh in the data that I have  
were inherently mostly positive but let's go now 
to that CSV file and just make sure that it's into  
the data as we expected so going across to that 
file this is the one there I'll just open that up  
we'll just wait for that to load up and Excel
I'll just make a little bit bigger so 
we can see so there my column here is  
r and you'll notice that now it's added 
the compound negative neutral positive  
and the general sentiment of course now you 
could create a chart if you want to in Excel  
or even using python but please subscribe to
