you know how your phone can actually
have a bunch of different applications
there's facebook and instagram and gmail
and youtube they're basically all
applications that run code that was
created by the company so that you could
interact with their company
well a dapp or a decentralized
application
is very similar in how it works except
instead of reporting back to facebook
servers or tick tock servers
this app reports back to the blockchain
you're simply interacting with the
blockchain through the application
welcome the whiteboard crypto the number
one youtube channel for crypto education
and here we explain topics of the
cryptocurrency world using analogies
stories and examples so that you can
easily understand them in this video we
are going to explain
exactly what a dapp or decentralized
application is
how they work and why they might hold
the key to the future of the technology
first we're going to go over some of the
benefits of dapps and then we're going
to cover the different types of them
including a bunch of specific examples
the first thing you need to know is that
dapps can only be built
on smart contract networks this means a
blockchain like bitcoin
cannot utilize dapps bitcoin was
designed to only allow the sending of
its native coin
ethereum however can utilize something
called smart contracts which is code
that makes up a program so that it can
be ran
to do more complicated things you should
check out our video on smart contracts
so that you're not confused throughout
this video
but in short they allow two people to
make an agreement written in code
so that they don't have to trust a third
party to follow through they can simply
just trust the code
another benefit is that since the code
is out there to be run
it is what we call open source which
means anyone can look at the code
this allows a lot more trust to be given
to the application
we can't really look at how facebook
recommends us friends to interact with
or how google knows what we ate for
dinner
but with any smart contract we can
actually look at the code
and see how it works this is a big
benefit over centralized applications
next dapps are also censorship resistant
and this is a fancy way of saying they
don't have to answer to governments or
corporations or even specific people
if the smart contract is coded to do
something and it's triggered
nobody can stop it naturally this is
good and bad
but it's really important for financial
applications this way nobody can control
your money
in history governments that have done a
lot of bad things
have had the control of their citizens
money there have also been cases where
facebook or twitter can actually ban
or censor certain people based on their
views or opinions
a decentralized application will not
allow this unless it's written
to another big benefit of decentralized
applications is that they will
essentially
never go offline now there's been times
where i've actually seen facebook or
even youtube down
maybe their servers have a bug or
there's an outage or they simply just do
not work it's
usually for a very short period of time
because there's a lot of money involved
but technically the government could
come in and just shut them down since
dapps run
on the blockchain they will actually
never go down because they are run by
hundreds of thousands of computers
all around the world it would be
infeasible to turn them all off if not
it's impossible
so now that you know what makes dapps so
cool let's get into some examples of
them
first off let's start off with financial
dapps
there are actually many decentralized
applications that provide a way for
people to invest in something called
decentralized finance decentralized
finance
or defy is a new monetary protocol that
uses blockchain to allow investors to do
new things
and even some old things with their
money with a ton of new benefits
let's go over some of the ways adapt may
use your money number one
borrowing and lending so ave is a
platform that allows a user to deposit
their ethereum or matic tokens to
certain smart contracts whenever you
deposit these coins and tokens
you can actually receive an interest
rate on them allowing you to basically
invest with them
ave also lets you borrow tokens
basically if you have enough collateral
already deposited so without going too
much in depth
this allows you to borrow at different
interest rates and even create
specific margin positions if you want to
learn more about ave we've actually
created a specific video over this topic
number two is providing liquidity so
providing liquidity
is actually a very complicated idea but
we're going to make it simple
in short there is not much money in the
tokens out there to trade
so investors can come along buy these
tokens
and then invest them in what is called a
liquidity pool which allows other people
to trade back and forth using their
tokens
the traders pay a small fee that allow
the investors to earn a return for their
investment
it's a win-win situation and number
three are
exchanges now as i mentioned allowing
traders to find a way to actually buy
and sell their tokens is one of the
issues in the decentralized finance
world
exchanges are decentralized applications
that allow traders to take some of their
tokens
and trade them for another token usually
with really low fees
almost instantaneously and without
needing any background checks or
identification verification
that was a mouthful but what it means is
that you can sell a million dollars of
ethereum
without anyone blinking an eye or asking
any questions by the way these exchanges
are actually called dexes which stands
for decentralized exchange
next up on the menu we have game dapps
now of course there's going to be games
i mean programmers are the ones creating
these daps so they're going to find a
way to gamify the space
number one is cryptokitties so
cryptokitties is a decentralized
application
that allow you to buy these little cute
kittens technically what you are buying
is the nft data of rights to that
certain token
that represents the kitty however the
fun part of this game
is that you can actually collect a bunch
of these kittens and even breed them to
create more kittens
in the community the older generation
kittens are usually the most valuable
and you can actually sell them for a
profit or maybe sometimes a loss
if you play the game long enough even
more so you can actually rent out your
kitten to breed with someone else's
kitten
as a strange form of passive income on
the blockchain
number two is something called zed run
zed is technically a gambling
application since you buy nfts that
represent
racing horses and then race them every
horse has specific skills and a point
system
also every race is recorded on the
blockchain so you can see
all of the races including the races
your horses have won or lost in
this game actually went viral for a
while because it combined the
psychological pulls of gambling
with the virality of a blockchain game
number three
is basically gambling so just like zed
is technically a gambling app
there is an absolute massive list of
blockchain gambling websites out there
that are technically
decentralized applications there are
daps that allow you to play
games like poker slots roulette even
simpler games like
dice rolling or coin tossing in fact you
can actually code these applications
so that the house always wins even if
it's by one percent but people love
playing these games
our next category is tracking apps so
there are actually many
applications out there that read smart
contract data
and information from the blockchain to
display it to you technically these are
decentralized applications but they're
usually centralized and hosted on a
single web server
and in most cases don't require the
blockchain specific code to work
however they do read the data from the
blockchain so we thought they deserved a
spot on this list so zapify is actually
a website that collects information
about wallets that you have
and the displays it all on one page not
only will it look at all the major daps
out there and find out how much money or
coins you have
it'll do it for many different networks
as well zapperfy is one of my favorites
because it's free to use and i can
actually see
a dashboard of my entire blockchain
portfolio in one place
now you should know there are many
different applications like zapify but
we thought we'd share the one that we
use
the next category is marketplaces number
one
is cryptokitties again even though we
put cryptokitties in the game category
it deserves its own spot in the
marketplace category
cryptokitties has proven themselves to
be an asset that people went crazy over
in the last few years the price of some
of these cryptokitties has skyrocketed
and their dap that allows you to buy and
sell these nft kitties is paving the
ground
for mass adoption number two is wearable
so wearable and
air nfts are two marketplaces for other
nfts
that allow you to buy sell and even
create new nft art that you specifically
can sell
these platforms or applications
facilitate the process
and allow the interaction with the
blockchain so an everyday person can use
it
lastly as an example of a marketplace
app we have bedali
bedali is a decentralized application
that allows you to buy things
using your crypto one of their main
products is basically
gift cards which they can actually
deliver anonymously and very quickly
remember whenever you buy stuff with
crypto in the united states at least
it is currently reported as a sale and
because of that you have to pay
taxes although bedali does not report to
the irs so the liability is in your
hands
you may see what we're saying here
anyways before we get ourselves into
trouble
let's move on to the next category which
is educational
so this is still an early announcement
but we are actually currently developing
our website into a decentralized
application where you can complete
quizzes
watch videos read articles and gain xp
through your metamask wallet
once you have enough experience you can
then mint limited edition nfts through
our platform if you're interested leave
a comment if you want to be an early
tester
one last dap that doesn't really fit
into any of these categories is
something called
ens ens stands for ethereum name
service and we actually have an entire
video explaining how it works
in short ens turns those long ethereum
addresses
into any address that you want for
example we actually own
whiteboardcrypto.eth
so if you send any of your coins or
tokens there it'll go to
our wallet now as we in this video you
need to know that the categories that we
listed are just the major ones we wanted
to share
this space is incredibly new and there
are new dapps being built
every day in fact blockchain developers
are one of the highest paying jobs this
year
simply because there is so much money
being poured into the space
and there's a lack of people knowing how
to code it the sky's the limit and we
truly believe this space has a lot of
potential
for positive growth maybe some of the
best developers that will ever be
may use our videos as resources to learn
and be inspired
at least that's our goal thank you guys
so much for watching this video
we hope that you enjoyed it we really
hope that you learned something
and most of all as always we hope to see
you in the next video
