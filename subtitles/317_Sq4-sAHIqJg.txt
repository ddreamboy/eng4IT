Starbucks doesn't just sell beverages
all over the world it also collects a
lot of data from over 100 million
transactions per week
what does it do with this information
and how do artificial intelligence and
The Internet of Things play a role in
this
regardless of the size of your company
Starbucks can be a great example of how
to use data and modern technology to
gain a competitive advantage
for example it is a Pioneer in combining
loyalty Systems payment cards and mobile
apps
but that is only the tip of the iceberg
this video highlights five of the most
interesting examples of how Starbucks
uses data artificial intelligence and
iot to gain a competitive advantage
Starbucks May no longer be a coffee
company but rather a data technology
company for food and beverages
it's no secret that Starbucks is a
data-driven company it operates over 30
000 stores worldwide and processes
nearly 100 million transactions per week
this provides it with an in-depth
understanding of what its customers
consume and enjoy
it may surprise you to learn that
Starbucks only started focusing on data
value a little more than a decade ago it
wasn't that it hadn't used Data before a
crisis prompted the company's
transformation as with many major
changes
in this case the change was prompted by
the 2008 financial blip and subsequent
store closures
this taught Howard Schultz then CEO of
Starbucks that data should be used more
analytically
prior to that Starbucks like many other
organizations made decisions based on
experience and judgment
choosing the right location is critical
to success in retail in 2007 and 2008
Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz was forced
to come out of retirement to close
hundreds of stores and rethink the
company's strategic growth plan
this time Starbucks took a more
disciplined data-driven approach to
store openings
the company can choose the most
strategic location for its new stores by
using location-based analytics powered
by Atlas a mapping and business
intelligence tool developed by esri
before recommending a new store location
Starbucks evaluates massive amounts of
data including variables such as
population income levels traffic
competitor presence and proximity to
other Starbucks locations
using this information the company can
forecast revenues profits and other
aspects of economic performance for that
location
the software is also assisting in
determining where the next 1500 Plus
stores should be located which will not
only help the company expand but will
also Drive revenue for new store
developments
Starbucks used the gathered data to
determine which products to offer when
launching new products
in particular when expanding its product
lines into grocery stores the company
heavily relies on the data gathered
according to a study 43 of tea drinkers
avoid adding sugar
Starbucks created a new product line of
unsweetened iced teas to cater to this
Market
also after discovering that 25 of
consumers do not add milk to their
coffee the company launched a new line
of black iced coffee without milk
these menu enhancements and grocery
store product launches are not only just
providing customers with their favorite
products they're also about convincing
their customers to avoid other coffee
brands while at home
it's a market share grab strategy that's
been hugely successful it's a way for
Starbucks to take a retail brand and
bring it into consumers homes
when Starbucks launched its Rewards
program and mobile app its data
collection increased significantly
this allowed them to get to know their
customers and extract information about
their purchasing habits
using its mobile app Starbucks collects
data about what where and when its
members purchase coffee
Starbucks uses the digital flywheel
program a cloud-based artificial
intelligence engine capable of making
precise food and beverage
recommendations
as a result even when people visit a new
Starbucks location the store's point of
sale system can identify the customer
through their phone and give the Barista
their preferred order
Starbucks could also suggest new
products a customer might like based on
their purchase history as well as
provide unique discounts and rewards on
specific items based on their unique
preferences
Starbucks went one step further by
collecting data on weather patterns and
their relationship with customer order
patterns
this enables the company to provide even
more personalized experiences and
promotions such as delivering cold
drinks to a customer on hot days
one implication of the preceding
examples is that Starbucks can
constantly refine and adjust its
offerings
Starbucks data-driven approach allows it
to make changes based on customers
location and time
this has an impact on products
promotions and pricing however if you're
in store offerings are displayed on
printed menu boards above the counter
there is a disconnect with the ability
to constantly adjust things
this is one of the reasons why retailers
continue to favor low-tech Solutions
such as blackboards
Starbucks on the other hand sees the
solution as a rollout of digital signage
in stores with computer-generated menu
displays
this completes a chain that allows
changes in the customer experience to be
reflected in the store
obviously this raises a slew of
questions and there's plenty of room for
things to get complicated
however as of mid-2018 Starbucks was
only testing this in a few locations
it concentrated its efforts on promoting
specific products based on local factors
such as weather or time of day
our final example as coffee machine
maintenance and General in store
machinery
the typical in-store Starbucks
transaction is relatively low cost and
short-lived
a store success is dependent on high
levels of customer throughput so when a
machine fails it can have a significant
impact on business performance
Starbucks doesn't keep Engineers on site
for breakdowns instead they send them
out to deal with repairs and to perform
planned maintenance
having Engineers respond quickly to
Broken machines makes a difference there
are conventional approaches to this
problem this typically means collecting
data about failures machine usage
repairs required and so on
regular data analytics as effective at
identifying Trends and patterns AI can
assist in taking this to the next level
by forecasting breakdowns and
maintenance requirements
Starbucks has taken a step forward by
developing a new coffee machine the
cloverex currently this is only used in
Flagship and concept stores
it's not only Cutting Edge in terms of
coffee making capability but it's also
Cloud connected
this not only enables a more
comprehensive collection of operational
data it also enables remote fault
diagnosis and even remote repairs
similar ideas will apply to other
machines for example stores now have a
standard oven that is also computer
controlled to ensure consistent
preparation of Hot Products around the
world
however the current machines need to be
updated by USB drive
this occurs Whenever there is a change
in machine configuration such as the
introduction of new products
in the future this will undoubtedly
become a direct Cloud connection opening
up more AI opportunities
while Starbucks was not born in the
digital era as a digitally native
company it has successfully integrated
new technologies into its Core Business
data analytics has unquestionably become
the backbone of Starbucks continuous
improvement over the years in the future
Starbucks will continue to gather more
data and apply it in even more
innovative ways to provide a more
personalized customer experience and
Achieve business excellence
Starbucks as a textbook example of how
to start a journey to utilize data
strategically implementing plans
systematically and thoroughly
another lesson is that artificial
intelligence as part of Starbucks
journey to learn how to use data using
artificial intelligence was not
something that happened out of a burning
desire
it was just a matter of doing it when
the time was right in each area
