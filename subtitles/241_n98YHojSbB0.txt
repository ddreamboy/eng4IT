when i was 10 years old i was playing
cool math games as you do on your free
time
and i noticed something in the corner of
my eye while i was playing didn't
immediately give it too much attention
but after a while i realized the gravity
of my situation and i quickly gasped for
air
i just won a new iphone 5s
no way i thought to myself so of course
i clicked the pop-up immediately
and input my parents email address
regular address phone number you know
to get me the iphone of course
a few hours later my dad comes yelling
at me that i downloaded something called
malware onto the computer
but i told him calm down just just wait
for the iphone okay
now waiting days became weeks weeks
became months months became years and to
this day i still do not have an iphone
5s ladies and gentlemen i believe i have
been scammed
now
the reason i illustrate this many of you
have probably had a similar experience
or under know somebody who's had a
similar experience
is that our relationship with technology
has been
simple like that it felt more like a
western movie wherever every now and
then there were some bandits but you
know it was you could deal with it and
you could get a little google search in
there every now and then
but as technology becomes more complex
so does our relationship with technology
when i talk about technology becoming
more complex i'm mostly referring to the
advent of ai technology in today's day
and age how many of you have a social
media account
please raise your hands i should be
seeing everybody because there's no way
you don't have a social media account in
this day and age
everybody has a social media account and
the main
interaction with that social media
account is artificial intelligence or
a system that is designed to mimic human
intelligence and learn through data now
it gets a bad rap because of literally
every sci-fi movie however at the end of
the day it's such a cool concept to
think about
a system that can manipulate large
amounts of data and learn from it that's
kind of incredible if you think about it
we could be solving problems like
transportation energy environment
we could count how many people in this
room have red shirts
that probably wouldn't be that useful
but at the very least we could do it
all that being said instead of being
used to solve those grand problems we
are having it recommend us motivational
shack clips on tick tock
if i see him rip the paycheck in half
one more time i'm going to lose it
now with this obviously i'm referring to
the commercialization of artificial
intelligence technology in terms of
marketing
imagine if you will a man that is in
your house every day staring at you
like that watching your every move
breath everything you eat
while you sleep it's pretty unnerving
right and then all of a sudden every
like 10 minutes or so he tries to sell
you like a football or something
that is essentially how artificial
intelligence is being used for marketing
and frankly it's unearthing
at the same time
what if you know that same guy locked
the doors in your house and you couldn't
escape and all you had was him standing
right there selling you advertisements
everyday and night watching you day and
night it
it would be pretty creepy right can we
all agree on that be pretty creepy i see
some head nods thank you
uh
frankly
that is essentially what's being done
though
you at home
at youtube yes we're getting meta with
this one
make sure to like comment and subscribe
you're probably eyeing that video over
there in the corner i see you yeah
you're probably gonna click that one and
then after that you're gonna find
another video you click that one you're
gonna keep going down this rabbit hole
chained to this endless scroll
i like that endless scroll that sounds
dramatic
frankly
when you're chained to that endless
world it's hard to think about anything
else and while youtube continues to
feed you advertisement after
advertisement
it gets it's pretty obvious that the
reason that you're being shown content
that you'd like to watch that you'd want
to see more of is so that you can be
marketed to so you can be advertised to
again closing the doors in your own
house and having a guy watch you all the
time
i mean it's a pretty extreme metaphor
but when you really think about it it
kind of makes sense
all of this
instead of being used to solve problems
frankly the way that big tech is using
artificial intelligence
is irresponsible and this is just a
microcosm of the many ethical issues
that come with artificial intelligence
you have artificial intelligence and
race bias which is something that i
never thought i would say in my life
you have artificial intelligence making
weapons why are we making weapons
at the end of the day
we have to understand that there's
something wrong with how we are doing
artificial intelligence in its most
commercial form and so how are we going
to address other ethical issues of
artificial intelligence if we don't even
address the most basic one
and that's why we need to start teaching
kids how to use artificial intelligence
in schools
we need you know let's let's face it big
tech is not gonna stop
you know they're they're making billions
of dollars and frankly
if i was worth 44 billion dollars
this talk would be very different
hey guys artificial intelligence is
great and used perfectly
frankly
they're not going to stop so we need to
address the problem at its root
the future
we need to start teaching the future
gen future problem solvers and airs if
you will who will be using artificial
intelligence to solve problems
how to solve those problems with ai
we need to create an ethical framework
for them perhaps you know
let's let's focus again not on
keeping people chained to an endless
scroll let's focus not on creating
political divide within our country
through echo chambers
that perhaps we can understand
okay
we need to
make ai
not like this how we're doing it right
now so and make it more productive in
the future
it's kind of like how we need to be
teaching kids how to use the internet
and how to be safe on the internet
though frankly we could be doing a
better job with that as well
at the end of the day
understanding the power that these tools
have
especially when used
productively and ethically
for those who are wanting to teach the
future generation the generation that's
supposed to save the world
it's a fairly important conversation to
have
we need to be
creating programs creating clubs
creating classes creating educational
materials to teach these kids not only
about the artificial intelligence
systems that will continue to be around
in their future that they will
eventually have to create
but also
to help them understand why we're what
we're doing wrong right now
ultimately if we can do that
if we can do all that
then maybe i can forgive you for not
giving me my iphone 5s
thank you
