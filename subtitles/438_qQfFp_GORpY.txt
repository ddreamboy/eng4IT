hello everyone welcome again in this
software testing tutorial
we are going to understand what is
software testing
now this is very very important question
when you go for any interview in
software testing
or even if you are trying to learn
software testing and
get into software testing job you need
to understand
basically what is software testing
before you can learn
any other concepts all right so first
thing
we need to understand what is software
testing
watch this video till end so that you do
not miss any of the key concepts that
i'm going to explain in this particular
tutorial
before we understand software testing
let's first understand
what is testing in general sense say for
example you go into the market you buy
any product
you take it back home as soon as say for
example
it is an electronic appliance or any
kitchen appliance
you plug it in and it you know
it doesn't work it doesn't turn on it
or if it turns on it it doesn't function
properly
what is your feeling in that particular
case you are really annoyed or we get
really annoyed
with the company or the product uh
you know the company that has provided
that product and
we question the quality assurance or the
quality
criteria that that company has
for their product line right now how do
the companies ensure that they are
delivering the quality product it is
through
the testing right so it doesn't matter
whether you
you are buying a car you are buying any
electronic appliances or anything
else there is always a level of testing
involved in any of the product that
goes into the market that you buy all
right
so even if you are you know
taking any of the services say for
example you are you know
opting for any services you also
consider the quality of the service
right how the customer services
so quality is everywhere whether it's a
service or product
now when it comes to products it is
basically
ensured through a defined a predefined
process of testing so that is in general
what testing is
if we talk about the product or any
other you know like industries
car manufacturing electronic
manufacturing etc
so they have their own defined processes
and tools to ensure
that the products that are coming out of
the assembly line
are being tested properly and work
properly before
they are you know brought into the
market and being sold to the consumers
and they use it right now when we
correlate that to software
when you test the software it becomes a
software testing
so what exactly software software is any
application say for example
any website you take any application uh
which which has complex functionality
around you know
front and back and web services so any
application which
fulfills the business logic is
sort of software if it is you know like
a mobile app
um or any other application that is
available out there over the internet
right so these sort of applications
are known as software so softwares are
built
into you know using many different
programming languages
for example like cc plus plus java there
are n number of programming languages
that can be used
now you have mobile devices where you
have apps so these are
all software when you are testing these
softwares
it is known as software testing now
software testing is not a standalone
activity
it's a predefined process that you need
to follow
from step by step and ensure that the
particular
product that you are trying to you know
put it to the market or say for example
an app you want to
install or you want to launch it into
the app store
prior to launching the app you want to
ensure that whatever functionality
that particular app needs to provide to
the customers
it works as expected i'll take an
example of
the app say for example whatsapp okay
very widely used
so say for example you are building
something similar or you are you are
creating something
similar to whatsapp so there will be
coding done
right so once the coding is done there
will be features added so for example
i should be able to you know send text
messages
to other people when i you know add them
in my contact list right when i add them
in the in the contact list
i should be able to call them so these
are you know like some of the features
that
in the whatsapp or the app scenario you
will basically
test before you actually say that yes
this functionality say functionality one
functionality two
is uh you know make call all right
so i should be able to make call i
should be able to
text to other person functionality three
add contacts right
and then functionality for say for
example
add profile picture
right at profile pic so these are some
of the
functionalities in this particular app
now this is the app now say for example
you want to test an e-commerce website
okay
so e-commerce website so what
functionalities that e-commerce website
will have
sorry about my handwriting um but this
is e-commerce website
so say for example functionality one is
you know add items add items
to cart then
functionality to
remove items right remove items if i
want to
from cart
okay so similarly there'll be you know
like different
so this is the example of the app this
is example of the website which will
have you know like
you know all different interfaces
built-in
integration built-in and then you as a
tester will follow a
defined process so you have this
requirement this functionality say for
example it will have
the requirement or it will come as a
user story if you are following scrum
methodology or agile agile approaches
then
you will basically go through those user
stories
and analyze the user stories write the
test cases to
ensure that these you know requirements
that are mentioned
say for example adding items into the
card you write test cases you will then
ensure that those test cases actually
work as expected right so you run the
website you launch the website
that is being built um and then you will
run those test cases what you will do is
you will add the items into the cart you
will try to add the items you will try
to remove the items from the card
and then proceed further so you'll say
yes these test cases have passed or
these
test cases have failed so if any of the
functionality doesn't work as
it is defined in the requirement you
will say it has
failed right so this is the overall
example or with example um
to explain you what exactly is software
testing it is not a standalone activity
it is a you know a life cycle
and it basically consists of um all the
static approaches and the dynamic
approaches so
there are a lot of activities that need
to be involved there say for example
once you get the requirement you analyze
those requirement as the testing team or
tester
and see whether there are any gaps into
those requirement
so that analysis is the static part when
you design your test cases you ensure
that all the coverage
for that particular requirement is there
for that particular
user story or the requirement all right
so that analysis
part is the static part when you execute
the code or when you run the code and
actually launch the website or actually
launch the whatsapp on ios or android
and then you know click on it or test or
follow different steps that's the
dynamic part of the software testing
right
so this is basically you know what
exactly software testing that's the
first part it is process it is it
consists of static and dynamic
testing the second thing is that
it is um meant to find
the defects prior to launching the
application right
before you launch any of the you know
app or application
to the customer software testing ensures
that your testing team is able to find
those errors well in advance before you
actually go into the production right
now 100 um defect removal or identifying
hundred percent defect
or making sure that your your product is
100 defect free
is not possible but yes still software
testing ensures that
most of the critical scenarios or the
basis
basic scenarios are still working the
edge scenarios
yes there could be possibility it is not
possible to test hundred percent
it is possible uh that there will be
still some you know production defects
and that's where that maintenance
testing comes into place
so this is a brief introduction and
correlation of software testing with any
other testing
into the market and with the you know
any of the application or
app that you test within the software
space so that's all for this tutorial
hope
i was able to clarify the question
what is software testing this is the
first and foremost
question if you're going for an
interview and our fresher or you know
like
new graduate you will be asked this
question so you need to
you need to know how you can correlate
it with the real life examples
and explain to the interviewer along
with you know
learning the overall software testing
from
here on so that's all for this tutorial
hope you like it
thank you very much for watching
