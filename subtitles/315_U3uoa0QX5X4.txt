well that's pretty cool
let's build one
hi welcome back to omg the cloud
today we are going to go ahead and
assemble that neat little temperature
sensor i just showed you so the first
thing we should do is to step through
the components that are involved in here
first we have our solar panel this
provides just enough charge
to keep the battery topped off and power
the circuit
and with this it can essentially run
indefinitely next up we have our charge
controller our tp4056
this takes care of our input from the
solar panel and output to the
microcontroller and charging the battery
and then this is our nice
little environmental sensor so this uh
handles temperature humidity and
barometric pressure runs on an spi bus
so this is something that is very
familiar to microcontroller platforms
and it's addressable so you can put
other things on that same bus
and just overall a great choice small
package
accurate and pretty reliable we're also
going to use a 220k
ohm resistor this is going to go between
an analog pin
and the battery voltage input so that we
can
detect the voltage of our battery that's
an important thing to know when we're
running a battery-powered circuit that
is being charged
we want to know that we are maintaining
a good voltage on that battery
and i went ahead and pre-cut some of
these wires just to make
things go a little bit quicker
additionally for this project you're
going to need a good soldering iron
and you want to have one of these
cleaning ball things here some good
fine electronics soldering wire i have
links to all of these down in the
description
so if you're not real familiar with
soldering projects this is a good time
to go ahead and get yourself started out
with the proper set of tools
so let's get started um i want to go
ahead and just pre-tin
these solder pads here so go ahead and
flow out a good little solder pad here
on each
of the positive and negative outputs on
that solar panel another thing to be
helpful is one of these little alligator
clip
extra pair of hands these can be really
helpful just for holding parts while
you're soldering so once you have the
charge controller soldered up let's go
ahead and get the
spi bus leads attached onto the micro
controller i'm going to throw a graphic
up here just to show exactly where we
are attaching because i know it's super
hard to see these so yeah take a look at
that there we want the
clock pin and then the data pin soldered
up and then we're gonna go ahead and
attach
ground and voltage in and let's turn our
attention back to our charge controller
let's go ahead and get the rest of those
leads soldered up we got our battery
holder in place
and then we need the output leads that
are going to go to the microcontroller
i'm going to go ahead and get those guys
soldered up real quick too get that
positive lead soldered in place
tint up the other end a little bit
negative side as well
and we're going to go ahead and solder
the positive side into the vcc
in on our microcontroller and let's get
the negative side over onto a ground pin
on the microcontroller okay i think
that's going to do it so we've got our
components all soldered up
and our temperature sensor in place and
solar panel and battery holder and we're
ready to go
and if just to test it if i go ahead and
plug in the battery here
we'll see that the microcontroller light
comes on
good we're in good shape so that's going
to do it for today
we've got our build complete and our
next
episode we're going to go ahead and
flash a firmware on here now in order to
flash a firmware though we need
something to flash with so we're going
to be
using a software package called esp home
which plugs in nicely to home assistant
and we're going to be using a command
line tool called esp
tool to flash our
firmware packages on there so we're
going to cover all that in next week's
episode
thank you so much for joining me today
this has been a lot of fun i hope you
learned something today
please subscribe give me a thumbs up and
don't forget to hit the notification
bell so you see when the next episode
comes in
have a great weekend and i'll see you
next time
