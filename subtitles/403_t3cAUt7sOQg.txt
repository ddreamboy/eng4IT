hello i'm dale from geckoboard and today
i'm going to give you 12 tips that will
help you design the perfect dashboard
[Music]
data data data businesses today are
surrounded by data which is nice but
it's not that helpful if you need to
make quick decisions this is where
dashboards can help dashboards take your
most important data and present it in a
way where you can easily tell what's
going on at a glance
because dashboards need to get across
information quickly and efficiently the
design and layout of the dashboard
becomes all that more important by the
end of this video you're going to have
the knowledge to design quality
dashboards that let people know exactly
what's going on
so the most important piece of advice we
have is to be clear about what it is
you're trying to achieve with your
dashboard
who is this dashboard for
how will it help with the decision
making are they trying to monitor some
kind of system or process or perhaps
they're trying to track the progress
towards a goal
so the clearer you are on the purpose of
your dashboard the easier it's going to
be to know what data to include and how
to present it
think of data communication like a game
of catch
the better you throw the ball
the easier it is for the other person to
catch it the most common mistake
designers make is overloading the user
with information
in other words they throw too many balls
at once
think carefully about the audience of
this dashboard do they need to see a
detailed breakdown of each customer
account every time they look at the
dashboard or would a high level number
be sufficient
the key here is working with your
audience
sure you need to understand what they do
need but you also need to understand
what they don't need and then you need
to be bold in deciding what to leave out
another way to improve your dashboard
design is by reducing the amount of
visual noise now the american
statistician edward tuft actually coined
a term for this concept data ink ratio
data inc is quite literally the ink that
communicates your data
whereas non-data inc is the stuff that
doesn't
these days you're unlikely to be
printing out your visualizations with
ink but the principle still applies
well-designed dashboards aim to use as
little non-data ink as possible in other
words they have a good data ink ratio
in practice this means removing
unnecessary grid lines
icons
color
labels or anything else that doesn't
actually communicate data
what you will find is that looking at
dashboards with a bad data rank ratio is
incredibly hard work for the user
especially if they're looking at this
dashboard several times a day
decorative elements may grab your
attention the first time you look at a
dashboard but the novelty very quickly
wears off and over time these things
just start to get in the way
overly precise numbers can actually slow
down our comprehension
ideally you should round your numbers to
a point where the differences between
figures represent a material change as
you can see here abbreviations can also
make it easier to understand what's
going on
okay so tell me which is bigger red or
blue
need more time
okay now try
easier right
when selecting a visualization you
should always choose the one which most
clearly and efficiently communicates the
data
that means it should take as little time
as possible to understand what's going
on
in general we humans aren't very good at
comparing and contrasting spatial area
that means that pie charts and area
charts are rarely the best choice of
visualization
i know it can be tempting to choose a
different visualization just because we
want to spice things up a little bit but
just don't do it if choosing the right
visualization means choosing the same
visualization then that's fine you're
doing your job most of the time you're
going to be using a combination of
numbers bars lines and tables
okay so when i was a kid before eating
things like m m's i would often group
them according to color
i was a pretty weird kid
but at least this type of worrying
behavior makes you more likely to be a
good dashboard designer in the future
why because good dashboards group
related metrics
so if somebody wants to see the metrics
related to revenue don't make them look
here and here and here
instead group them plus you save on
non-data inc because now you need less
labels
if you have a related group of metrics
it's helpful to be consistent in your
choice of visualization for example
let's take a look at this dashboard
so here we have the number of orders
each day and here we have the value of
those orders
clearly there's a relationship between
these metrics
so we're going to want to use the same
visualization to help the user
understand that relationship
again don't worry if this feels like
you're being repetitive what you're
actually doing is helping people think
about related metrics in the same way
not all kpis are equal and a good
dashboard should reflect there
if there's a metric you want people to
pay attention to
make it bigger put it in the top left
hand corner
the top left hand corner is where our
eyes are naturally drawn
followed by the other edges of the
dashboard
numbers on their own don't actually tell
us that much let's say yesterday's
revenue is five thousand dollars
is that good bad normal unusual how does
it compare to last week has it gone up
has it gone down how does it compare to
our targets
giving context to a number in the form
of a status indicator or a comparison
can quickly tell us the significance of
that number just be aware of the first
rule too many status indicators can
create noise if your entire dashboard is
red and green then the significance of
those colors is greatly reduced
similarly a number of a chart isn't very
useful if we don't know what it
represents use labels to clearly state
what the metric represents and also what
time span
your label should be clear and concise
avoid notes explanations and caveats
these things might feel like they're
helpful the first time somebody uses a
dashboard but it very quickly becomes
visual noise
so far in this video we've covered 10
rules for designing the perfect
dashboard but the thing about design
rules
like all rules is that they're made to
be broken at the end of the day
dashboard design is about more than just
how efficiently you can lay data out on
a 16x9 rectangle
ultimately it's about people it's about
to what extent you can get those people
to engage with the information
and sometimes the most engaging
dashboards do break the rules for
example at geckoboard one of our company
dashboards includes a list of recent
subscribers
in a strict design sense it's probably
not as important as some of the other
elements on this dashboard
but we include it because it sparks
conversations and increases engagements
with the dashboard overall so whether
it's a twitter feed new deals or a daily
cat gif remember that it's okay to break
the rules if it means that people engage
with your dashboard just don't overdo it
the last thing to say is that you should
keep tweaking and evolving your
dashboard the best way to tell if you've
designed a great dashboard is by using
it does it help people do what it's
supposed to do make sure you continue to
listen to feedback because when it comes
to dashboards you can always improve
so there we have it 12 tips for
designing the perfect dashboard now all
the lessons um we've covered today are
applicable to any form of dashboard
design but you may have noticed that in
many of the examples i've been using our
very own dashboard tool geckoboard
geckoboard makes it easy to create
professional kpi dashboards it connects
with over 80 data sources and it's just
much easier to use than many of the
complicated bi tools out there and one
of the best parts is that geckoboard is
built with all of these design practices
in mind so it makes it very very hard to
