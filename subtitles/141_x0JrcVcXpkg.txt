hello everyone
welcome to another exciting session on
data mining today
my name is rajan shaitri and in today's
session i am going to share
my understanding of data mining
let us start with the agenda first of
all
so initially we are going to start with
the introduction of what data mining
is and we are trying to understand the
basics of it
once we understand the basics of data
mining we'll try to understand data
mining more in detail
and after that we'll be understanding
the various application areas
of data mining let us start
with the intro
well before we start discussing what
data mining is
first of all let us understand the
basics of why we need data mining
and how it all started so in today's
scenario
one way of people's success is
identified
by how they are communicating and
sharing the information
with others that's where the concept of
language comes into the picture
however there are many languages in the
world
each has many standards and alphabets
and the combination of these words
arranged meaningfully resulted in the
formation of a sentence
each language has its own rules while
developing these sentences
and these set of rules are known as
grammar
in today's world according to industry
estimates only 20
of the data is being generated in the
structured format as we speak
as we tweet or as we send some messages
on whatsapp
email facebook instagram or whatnot
and the majority of this data exist in
the textual form
which is a highly unstructured format in
order to produce
meaningful insights from this text data
there
we exactly need to follow something
called text analysis
now that's where data mining comes into
the picture data mining is a process of
discovering
predictive information from the analysis
of large databases
for a data scientist data mining can be
a vague and daunting task
it requires a diverse set of skills and
knowledge
of many data mining techniques to take
raw data
and successfully get insights from it
all right now as we have provided
the introduction to data mining first of
all let us start with why exactly we
need to do data mining
so let us answer some basic question
here
such as why data mining
in order to understand data mining let
us take some use cases here
for example let's say credit rating
or targeted marketing
so what exactly this is let us suppose
there is a database given of let's say
hundred thousand hundred thousand names
which persons
are the least likely to default on their
credit cards
identify likely responders to sale
promotions
so that is basically one of the use case
where we use data mining
the second use case could be
fraud detection now what exactly
is the role played by data mining and
fraud detection
you know we can answer such questions
for example let's say
which types of transactions are likely
to be fraudulent
given the customer demographics and
transactional history
of a particular customer
the third use case could be
customer relationship management
after all every company wants to have
good relations with the customers
we can using data mining we can answer
such questions
for example which of my customers are
likely to be the most
loyal and which are most likely to leave
for a competitor now we can answer all
these questions
and solve all these scenarios by using
data mining here now data mining helps
extract such information
all right so in data mining we process
or semi-automatically we analyze large
databases to find patterns
that are valid that are novel
useful and understandable
now this process is also known as kdt
kdd stands for knowledge discovery
database
now let's talk about the applications of
data mining where we can exactly
you know implement
data mining techniques so the
applications of data mining
can be banking
well let's let us understand banking in
terms of loan
or credit card approval you can think of
you know predicting good customers based
on old customers
second example as i mentioned earlier
could be
customer or relationship management
the use case could be identifying those
who are likely to leave
for a competitor
third targeted marketing
that we have already done
well i invite likely responders to the
promotion
and four is basically fraud detection
well from an online stream of events
identify the fraudulent
events as an application of data mining
well we can use data mining in
manufacturing
and production
well using data mining we can
automatically adjust
knobs when processes parameter changes
we can use data mining and healthcare as
well
or in simple words we can use it in
medicines
for example for identifying the disease
outcomes
effectiveness of the treatment analyzing
patients disease history
finding a relationship between diseases
all these things can be done
using data mining well we can use
determining for
you know scientific analysis as well
and we can use data mining in websites
you know for design and promotion
let us understand types of data mining
well there are various types of data
mining we have available
so let us understand data mining can be
performed
in the following types of data so we can
perform
data mining on the data which is fetched
from
a relational database
well if in case if you don't have any
understanding of what your relational
database is
let me provide you with a small
description here our relational database
is a collection of multiple data sets
formally organized by tables records and
columns
from which data can be accessed in
various ways without having to
recognize the tables itself
table convey and share information which
facilitates
data searchability reporting and
organization basically
we can think of you know performing data
mining
on the data from data warehouses
now data warehouse is in itself is a
broader you know domain so what exactly
is a data warehouse
a data warehouse is basically a
technology that collects
the data from various sources within the
organization to provide some meaningful
business insights the huge amount of
data which comes from multiple sources
such as marketing maybe maybe finance
you know is extracted and utilized for
analytical purposes
and help in making decisions you can
call it
as a decision science as well
really we can you know uh do the data
mining fetch from you know data
repositories
we can do the data mining fetch from
object relational databases
and we can also you know perform the
data mining
you know from transactional databases
well uh there are various advantages of
you know uh data mining that we have
so for example the data mining
techniques enables any organization
to obtain knowledge based data the
second advantage can be you know
it enables organization to make
liquidative modifications
in operations and productions for
attracting more customers
compared with other statistical data
applications data mining is a cost
efficient solution well
if you combine every aspect of data
mining in simple words
it is going to help the organizations
for decision making
well it is a quick process and it is
easy for new users to analyze
enormous amount of data
all right now now we have a clear
understanding of what data mining
is and what are its applications let us
understand how the data mining
is implemented the implementation of
data mining
entirely relies on the kdd process
in data mining so here we're going to
spend some time
on understanding what this kdd process
and data mining is
well i hope you remember the term kdd
stands for
knowledge discovery in databases
well volume of information is increasing
every day that we can handle
from business transactions scientific
data sensor data pictures videos
or whatnot well
we need a system that will be capable of
extracting essence of information
available
and that can automatically generate
reports views
or summary of data for better decision
making
well data mining is used for business to
make
better managerial decisions
we make better managerial decisions by
automatic summarization of the data by
extracting the essence of information
stored
or by discovering the patterns in the
raw data
for this let us understand what are the
steps
steps which are involved in the kdd
process
well in order to understand the steps in
kdd process let us look at the
phases here all right
so here you can see a pictorial
representation of how the kdd process
is followed in data mining here we have
various components here such as starting
from databases
to data warehouses then there's a data
mining process
and finding the patterns and pattern
evaluation and then there is a knowledge
here
so let us understand all these phases
one by one in a step-by-step manner
so the very first phase that we are
talking here about is basically
the data cleaning so what exactly is
data cleaning
data cleaning can be defined as a
removal of
noisy and irrelevant data from your
collection
well we perform the data cleaning if in
case if there are any
missing values in the data we clean the
noisy data
where the noise is a random or a
variance
error we do the cleaning with data
discrepancy detection
and data transformation tools
then the next phase is data integration
now data integration is defined as
heterogeneous data
from multiple sources combined in a
common source
such as data warehouse now
this data integration happens using data
migration tools
uh or we can also call them data
synchronization tools
well this data integration using extract
transform load process is is the
solution
right so we use atl process for this
data creation
then there is something called data
selection
data selection and transformation right
so
let us discuss the data selection first
of all
data selection is defined as a process
where
the data relevant to the analysis is
decided
and retrieved from the collection or the
data collection you can say
well data selection uh can be done using
neural networks
it can be done you know using decision
trees
nav buys or clustering or regression
etc so there are actually you know uh
tons and tons of uh algorithms and you
know
techniques available for data selection
well once the data selection process is
done we move forward
to the data transformation let us
understand data transformation clearly
here
data transformation can be defined as a
process
of transforming data into an
appropriate form which is required for
the
mining procedure right so data
transformation is basically a two-step
process
one is basically let's call it
data mapping and the second is
code generation well in data mapping
we assign elements from source
base to a destination to capture the
transformation
well if we talk about the code
generation it is based it is simple
it is creation of the actual
transformation program
which is going to you know do the action
or processing for us
once we have done the data selection and
data transformation process
we move to the next phase and that is
data mining
data mining as i you know explained
earlier it is a process
of you know of clever techniques we can
say right that are applied
to extract patterns which are
potentially useful for the businesses
well then we move on to
pattern evaluation pattern evolution is
something which you know which is used
for identifying strictly
increasing patterns representing
knowledge based
on measures for example we can use
summarization here we can use
visualization of the data
to make the data understandable by the
user
then finally knowledge representation
and
this knowledge representation is
basically the technique
right which is used for representing
data or the mining results
for knowledge representation we can use
various tools
such as you know we can use tables we
can use reports
we can use you know any classification
or characterization rules
there are tons and tons of processes
all right so this is a gist of you know
how the kdd process
happens i know in a data mining process
and the various components which are
involved in it i hope you have
understood the concepts clearly
here
all right so as we have understood how
to
implement the kdd process in data mining
let us understand the various techniques
that are used for data mining so here
we are trying to understand data mining
techniques
there are various techniques available
for implementing data mining
here we are going to discuss these data
mining techniques one by one
first of all let us talk about the very
popular data mining technique
and that is classification
well classification is used to retrieve
important and relevant information about
data
and metadata this data mining method
helps to classify data in different
classes
the second technique that we are
learning here is class clustering
clustering is the second data mining
technique
well clustering analysis is a data
mining technique
to identify data that are likely that
are like each other
this process helps to understand the
difference and similarities between the
data
the third technique that we are talking
here about determining
is regression
well regression analysis is the data
mining method of identifying
and analyzing the relationships between
the variables
it is used to identify the likelihood of
a specific variable
given the presence of other variables
the fourth technique that we are talking
here about
is association rules
now what exactly this is this is a data
mining technique that helps to find
the association between two or more
items
it discovers a hidden pattern in a data
set
the fifth technique here we are talking
about is
outer detection
what is outer detection this type of
data mining technique
refers to observation of data items
in the data set which do not match an
expected pattern
or expected behavior this technique can
be used in a variety of domains
such as intrusion detection fraud or
fault detection etc auto detection is
also
called outlier analysis or outlier
mining
now the next technique here we are
talking about is
sequential patterns
this data mining technique helps to
discover or identify
similar patterns or trends in
transaction data
for certain period
and the next technique here we are
talking about is prediction
prediction has used a combination of
other techniques of data mining like
trends sequential pattern clustering
classification
basically what it does it analyzes past
events or instances
in a right sequence for predicting a
future event
well there are various data mining
techniques which we can use here
but when we use the techniques of data
mining there are various challenges
which are associated with the
implementation
for example there are various challenges
such as skilled experts
so skills experts are needed to
formulate the data mining queries
the second challenge is basically the
overfitting
due to the small size training database
a model
may not fit future states
the third challenge is basically the
data mining needs large databases which
sometimes are difficult to manage
while business practices may need to be
modified to determine to use the
information
uncovered what if the data set is not
diverse
data mining results may not be accurate
and finally the integration information
needed
from heterogeneous databases and global
information
systems could be complex
now there were the various challenges
which are associated with data mining
let us talk about the data mining tools
which we can use to implement the
techniques
so there are various data mining tools
which are available in the market here
the very popular data mining tools are
our language
so our language is an open source tool
for statistical computing
and graphics r has a wide variety of
statistical classical statistical tests
time series analysis classification and
graphical techniques
it offers effective data handling and
storage facility
the second technique is oracle data
mining
well oracle data mining popularly known
as
odm is a module of the oracle's
advanced analytics database
this data mining tool allows data
analysts to generate
detailed insights and make predictions
it helps predict customer behavior
develop customer profiles
identify cross-selling opportunities
and the third technique that we are
third tool that we are talking here
about is python
well python is a popular
programming languages which is widely
used for you know machine learning
or data science implementations it has a
wide area of
libraries available which can be used
for
implementing data mining
let us talk about a very popular
confusion
or a subject which basically creates
a misunderstanding between data mining
versus
machine learning
it has been observed that many of the
learners
assume that both are same let us
understand
the difference between data mining and
machine learning
well later mining relates to extracting
information
from a large quantity of data data
mining is a technique
of discovering different kinds of
patterns that are inherited
in the data set and which are precise
new
and useful data mining is working
as a subset of business analytics and
similar to experimental studies data
mining's origin
our databases and statistics whereas if
we talk about the machine learning
machine learning includes an algorithm
that automatically improves
through database experience machine
learning is a way to find a new
algorithm from experience
machine learning includes the study of
an algorithm
that can automatically extract the data
machine learning utilizes data mining
techniques
and other learning algorithms to
construct models
of what is happening behind certain
information
so that it can predict future results
data mining and machine learning are
areas that have been influenced
by each other although they have many
common things
yet they have different ends
data mining is performed on certain data
sets by humans
to find interesting patterns between the
items in the data set
data mining uses techniques created by
machine learning
for creating the results while machine
learning
is the capability of the computer to
learn
from a minded data set machine learning
algorithms
takes the information that represents
the relationship between
items in a data set and creates models
in order to predict future results these
models are nothing
more than actions that will be taken by
the machine
to achieve a result so i think
this you know explanation should clear
the difference
between machine learning and
determining well there are many other
differences which we can discuss about
data mining and machine learning
for example let's talk about origin
well if we talk about origin of data
mining
it is from traditional databases with
unstructured data
if we talk about the origin of machine
learning here it has an
existing algorithm and data
well if we talk about the meanings of
both the
terms the data mining stands about
extracting
information from a huge amount of data
whereas on the other side if we talk
about the meaning of machine learning
it introduces new information from data
as well as previous experience
new information
from previous experience
well if we go a little back
in the history of both the terms
this determining is is in existence
since 1930s popularly known as
kdt whereas if we talk about the machine
learning
this was very first introduced in the
1950s
well if we talk about the purpose of
you know both the uh
concepts of you know data mining and
machine learning data mining is used to
obtain the rules from the
existing data rules
from the existing data
whereas if you talk about the machine
learning here machine learning basically
you know
teaches a computer a computer
about you know how to learn and
comprehend the rule
about how to learn
and comprehend
the role
well if we talk about the applications
here
there are various applications of both
the you know domains here
so whereas where machine data mining is
basically used
for variety of use cases let's say
the cluster analysis
whereas the machine learning can be used
to obtain
you know the results from the large
amount of you know data
which are very precise and accurate
the machine learning has its
implementations or applications in web
and you know uh computers and in you
know in
designs everywhere
well there are various techniques you
know available
uh for data mining we have already
discussed this and
there are other you know libraries
available for
machine learning all right so it it
looks like
both have a very good scope of you know
implementation for solving
the real world problems
all right this time let us understand
the difference between data mining
versus data warehousing
well we have already explained what data
mining is here
this time we are going to understand
data warehousing more in detail
well data warehousing refers to the
process of compiling and
organizing data into one common database
whereas data mining refers to the
process of extracting useful data
from the database the data mining
process depends
on the data compiled in the data
warehouse
phase to recognize meaningful patterns
our data warehousing is created to
support management systems
a data warehouse refers to a place where
exactly data can be stored for useful
mining
it is like a quick computer system with
exceptionally huge data
storage capacity data from various
organizations
systems are copied to the warehouse
where it can be fetched
and confirmed to delete errors here
advanced requests can be made against
the warehouse storage of data
how a database housing process looks
like basically
we can think of data warehousing process
in this way
so let us suppose here we have the
various sources of data
so here this is the source of
data
now this source of data is basically you
know from this source of data the data
is basically extracted
and transformed
once the data is transformed the data is
loaded
at the target machine or at the
destination or in the warehouse
this is how the process our data
warehouse looks like
data warehouse combines data from
numerous sources which ensures
the data quality accuracy and
consistency
data warehouses boosts system execution
by separating
analytics processing from transactional
databases
data flows into a data warehouse from
our different databases
our data warehouse works by sorting out
data into a pattern
that depicts the format and types of
data
data warehouses and databases both are
relative data systems
but both are made to serve different
purposes
a data warehouse is a built to store a
huge amount of historical data
and empowers fast requests over all the
data typically using
olap or online analytical processing
whereas on the other side a database is
made to store current transactions and
allow quick access to specific
transactions
for ongoing businesses processes
commonly known as online transaction
processing
all right here let us try to understand
the difference between determining and
data analytics
many of the learners have been observed
considering both the same
well data mining and data analytics are
crucial steps in
any data driven projects and are needed
to be done
with perfection to ensure the project
success
adhering to both fields closeness as
mentioned earlier
can make finding the difference between
data mining
and analytics quite challenging before
we are in the state to understand
do our data mining versus data analytics
comparison
we must first closely understand the two
fields very closely
well we have been discussing data mining
for a while but let's
give it a quick revision here data
mining is a deliberate and successive
cycle of distinguishing
and finding shorter examples and
identifying useful data
in an enormous data set
it's otherwise also called knowledge
discovery in database
which has been already told to all of
you it's been trend since
you know the 1990s and has been in
existence
since 1930s the improvement in computing
pro is has although allowed data mining
to become streamlined
and mainstream whereas on the other side
if we talk about data analysis it is the
information
analysis then again is a superset of
data mining
which includes removing cleaning
changing
demonstrating the data to reveal
significant
and valuable insights that can help
determine
the way to proceed forward and make
choices
pertaining to the company in question
well data analysis as a cycle has been
around since the 1960s
it has only recently come into the
mainstream
and has proven to be an intense
indentable tool to any significant
global players arsenal now that we know
the basics of data mining and data
analytics
we are positioned to pit data mining
versus data analytics head to head
and understand all the nuances and
differences
between data mining and data analytics
well although data mining and data
analytics are two different words in the
field of data
they are sometimes used in place of the
others
the usage and the meaning behind the
terms
depend highly on the context and the
company in question
to set up their individual identities
such that you can easily differentiate
between the two you will find the
significant contrasting points
here for example let us talk about
the very first point here which is data
mining
well data mining is a criteria right
it's a criteria
the data collection and deriving crude
but
in essential insights
so here in determining the criteria
which is followed here
is to you know it has to ensure that it
collects
the essential insights from the data
data analytics
then uses the data and crude
hypothesis to build upon that the data
create a model
based on the data data mining is a step
in the process of
data analytics
well data analytics is the umbrella
which deals with every step
in the pipeline of any data-driven model
data mining shines its brightest when
the data is questioned
is well structured meanwhile data
analysis
can be performed on any data it would
still be able
to derive meaningful insights that could
help in propelling
the corporations to even greater
height
well when we are talking about data
mining
it is uh you know it's it is task
oriented
so data mining is tasked to accomplish
the main job to make
the data that is being used more usable
whereas data analysis is used to
hypothesize
and in the end culminate itself in
providing
valuable information to help in business
decisions
all right so determining does not need
any
bias or any notion which are instilled
before tackling the data whereas data
analysis
is majorly used for hypothesis testing
data mining uses the scientific and
mathematical models
and methods to identify patterns or
trends in the data
that is being mined on the other hand if
we talk about data analysis
it is employed to task with business
analytics
problems and derive analytical models
data mining usually does not depend on
any visualizations or bar charts or
graphs etc
whereas these resolutions are the bread
and butter
for data analysis without a good
representation
of the data all the efforts which are
put into the analysis of the data
would not come to fruition
well to give it a conclusion here you
know we have been seeing
both the terms that is data mining and
data analysis
for a long time these terms were
palpable until the leap in the shear
power computers
made it possible for anyone with a
computer to jump
in and play with the data both data
mining
and data analytics are crucial to be
done perfectly
due to the very nature of the two
following fields
their names have been used
interchangeably by
individual business people meanwhile
there are also people
present who have appreciated the
differences
in the areas and made sure to respect
the boundaries of the two fields
in whatever camp you might side with you
cannot deny
the importance of both in a data-driven
world
of the 21st century other thing
set in stone is the skill set required
for these
fields
all right so let us talk about the top
data mining algorithms here
determine algorithms are applied through
the algorithms behind it
these algorithms run on the data
extraction softwares
and are applied based on the business
need
some of the algorithms that are widely
used by the organizations
to analyze the data sets are as follows
the very first algorithm that we're
discussing here is a very popular
algorithm for data mining
this algorithm is popularly known as
k-means
k-means is a popular cluster analysis
technique
where a group of similar items are
clustered together
let us talk about the second algorithm
the second
algorithm is also widely used for data
mining
and this is a priori algorithm
well it is a frequent item set mining
technique and
association rules are applied to it on
transactional databases it will detect
frequent item set and highlight general
trends
the third is also very popular here and
this is called
k nearest neighbor
this method is used for classification
and regression analysis
the k-nearest neighbor is lazy learning
where it stores
the training data and when a new
unlabeled data comes
it will classify the input data
the fourth algorithm is basically naive
bayes
it is a group of simple probabilistic
classification algorithms
which assume that each data object
features are independent of the other it
is an
application of bayes theorem
and the fifth algorithm is basically add
a boost
it is a machine learning metal gotham
that is used to improve
performance at a boost is sensitive to
noisy data
and outliers
all right so this brings us to the
conclusion of today's session
well before we conclude this conclude
the session let us have
a quick summary of what we have
discussed
well first of all let us start from the
definition of data mining
determining is all about explaining the
past
and predicting the future wire data
analysis
well data mining helps you extract
information
from huge sets of data it is a procedure
of mining knowledge from data
the process of this data mining includes
business understanding data
understanding data preparation
modeling evaluations and deployment
well important data mining techniques
are classification
clustering regression
association rules auto detection
sequential patterns and predictions
our language and oracle data mining as
well
as python these are the prominent
determining tools
and techniques well data mining
helps companies to get knowledge based
information
the main drawback of data mining is that
many analytics software is difficult to
operate
and require advanced training to work on
data mining is used in diverse
industries
such as communications insurance
education
manufacturing banking retail
ecommerce and supermarkets
in this video tutorial we have discussed
the various data mining techniques
that can help organizations and business
find
the most useful and relevant information
well this information is used to create
models that will predict
the behavior of customers
for the businesses to act on it
by you know understanding all the
information that we have delivered in
this session about the data
mining techniques one can determine its
credibility
and feasibility even better data
extraction techniques
include working with data reformatting
restructuring
and you know the various processings
which are followed during the kdd
process
well finally all these techniques that
we have discussed on the methods in data
mining systems help
in the discovery of new creative
innovations
well that's all that's all for today
everyone
