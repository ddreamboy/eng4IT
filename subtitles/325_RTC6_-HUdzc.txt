hi are you researching python frameworks
to become a better developer
and to get developer contracts well then
this video is for you because that's
exactly what i'm going to give you
so we're going to cover the types of
frameworks the best current frameworks
for this year and their uses
and the differences between frameworks
and libraries
which a lot of developers get wrong so
why am i qualified to talk about this
well i've been in web development for 11
years and i'm currently working directly
with over 200 freelancers developers and
agency owners
so this video is for people who are
serious about learning python and
getting
contracts so before we dive into the
content do click on the subscribe button
and the bell notification
for all notifications icon so that you
get future updates
on more python tutorials so who uses
python
full stack developers back-end
developers and front-end developers
there are three types of python
frameworks
first one is the full stack framework
such frameworks are
one-stop solutions for all developer
requirements
they feature form generators form
validation and
template layouts this is usually
available
in a full stack framework the second
type of python framework
is the micro framework these are light
to late frameworks that don't offer
additional functionalities
and features such as database
abstraction layers
form validation and specific tools and
libraries developers using a micro
framework
usually need to add a lot of code and
additional requirements
manually so the third type of python
framework is the asynchronous framework
any asynchronous framework is a micro
framework that allows for handling
a large set of concurrent connections
usually an
asynchronous framework is built for
python using
the programming languages async io
library so now let's get into the list
of the most popular frameworks and their
uses the first one is django from
djangoproject.com the free to use and
open source full stack python framework
includes a huge amount of in-built
features
rather than offering them as individual
libraries django makes use of its
object relational mapper for mapping
objects
to database stables this results in
allowing the code to work across
different databases as well as
making it easier to migrate from one
database to another so this allows the
code to work across different databases
as well as making it easier to migrate
from one database to another
django features ready-to-use libraries
and authentication support
the second most popular framework for
python currently is
flask from c
o o flask.poco.org org this is a micro
framework available
under the bsd license flask allows
developers to build
a solid web application foundation from
where it is possible to use
any kind of extensions required this
micro framework is compatible with
google app engine and it has a built-in
fast debugger and restful request
dispatching it also features support for
plugging in any orm
so the third most popular python
framework is tornado from
tornadoweb.org the tornado is
an open source python framework and an
asynchronous networking
library it's a tool to build high
performance
high concurrent user amount apps so the
fourth most popular framework is aiohttp
it relies heavily on python 3.5 and
beyond features
such as async and awaits in addition to
being a server
web framework ai oh ttp can also serve
as a client framework it supports both
client websockets and server websockets
without the callback hell
the fifth most popular python framework
is
fast api fast api is a high performance
framework it basically is a web
framework for building apis with python
3.6 and beyond
based on standard python type hints
it's very high performance and on par
with node.js and
goling the sixth most popular python
framework is bottle this micro framework
creates a single source file for every
application developed using it this
micro framework for python was
originally developed
for building apis other than the python
standard library
bottle has no dependencies required for
crafting
small web applications one of the most
important advantages
of using bottle is that it allows
developers to work
closer to the hardware so the seven most
popular python framework is pyramid so
this is a full stack framework
for python and the primary goal of this
open source python
based web development framework is to
achieve as much
as possible with minimalistic complexity
it features flexible authentication and
authorization
function decorators predicates and
renderers
so what's the difference between a
framework and a python library
it's kind of what happened in the
industrial revolution we went from
families running their own little
production facilities where they did
everything from scratch
in the big backyard essentially or in a
shed to
create basic necessities to having a
bunch of factories
churning out cheaper better quality
products at a thousand times the
efficiency right
that's basically what happened when
developers started using
frameworks and by efficiency i don't
just mean how well the code works
i also mean how fast it's created so a
web framework is a collection of
packages or modules which allow
developers to write web applications or
services
without having to handle such low level
details as protocols
sockets or process thread management
they promote
rapid development and clean design they
are developed by a group of experienced
programmers
who aim to remove the hassles of
developing and allow teams to focus on
writing code
without having to reinvent the wheel
every time that means writing fewer
lines of code
a framework usually includes the
structure
and foundation for building some
frameworks contain basic code that use
libraries frameworks define how you
solve a problem
and usually include tools to use their
ways to solve problems
python libraries however are a set of
useful functions
that eliminate the need for writing code
from scratch
there are over a hundred and thirty
thousand python libraries present today
a library in python is a pre-built piece
of code that can do
all the things you are too lazy or
inexperienced
to do or if you're just pressed for time
you can also use them in the past people
used to write all the code themselves
this is
super inefficient if you want to get
stuff done faster meaning
if you want to get something done in a
week rather than two months
you should remove repetitive tasks this
is what frameworks help with
the most libraries help you solve very
direct problems so now let's talk about
getting
contracts for yourself as a developer
and as a python developer so what you
want to do essentially is
use the skills that you're building to
go on places like upwork which is a
freelancing
platform and get contracts on there it's
very beginner friendly
regardless of what crazy angry youtubers
are saying it's not that
hard to approach upwork especially if
you use the guy that i've got about to
link you which is right here
so click on the video right here there's
a whole playlist with how to use
upwork and get contracts as a python
developer
or a different type of developer so
watch the video list
right here and it's also in the
description if you can't
click on the video if you have any
comments or questions i usually respond
to the best ones myself below this video
