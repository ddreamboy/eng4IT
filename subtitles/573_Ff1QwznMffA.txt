today we're going to be talking about ubiquitous 
computing um people a lot of people also call it  
ubicomp so i'm going to be using the phrase 
ubicomp as well as ubiquitous computing so  
whenever you hear me say you become that's just a 
compression of ebooks ubiquitous computing because  
as you can tell it's quite hard to say ubiquitous 
a lot so that's why people say you become  
okay so you become so is this the 
idea of computers being everywhere  
or is it is it more than that there's a kind of 
vision associated with ub comp which is all about  
i guess sort of disappearing of computers or at 
least the idea of computers not being kind of  
visible to us not necessarily that we can't see 
them but they're effectively invisible in our  
kind of practices so when we kind of go and do 
stuff in the world we're interact interacting  
with and using computing technologies all the 
time but the ways in which we're doing it we're  
not really focusing on on the on the technology 
itself and it's quite in contrast to kind of how  
people talk about people say using mobile phones 
and just being completely focused on the phone  
and so on so the idea of the vision 
of ubicomp is obvious of this kind of  
world of um seamless interactions with technology 
that just simply uh help us get stuff done
one of the founders of ubiquitous computing um 
or ubicomp as well now call it was mark weiser  
and he talked particularly about calm computing so 
this idea that there's not this kind of frenetic  
activity interacting with all these devices 
and managing all this kind of digital stuff  
rather i'm just simply able to do things in life 
in a kind of calm way and it just so happens that  
i use technology to get those things done way 
back in the midst of time in the early days of  
computer file we did something called a video 
called what is a computer i think it was with  
professor tom rodden and we were talking about 
the ideas of computers being in credit cards and  
computers being in all sorts of places that you 
don't even realize things like the internet of  
things i suppose we're talking about here but it's 
not just as you say that it's also the fact that  
our interaction with them is not something that 
we even necessarily consider is that is that about  
right well the kind of the idea of ubicomp turns 
on is that um it's embedded into everyday life  
so in much the same way that we don't really think 
necessarily about some of the infrastructures in  
our house that kind of enable our house to go to 
work properly so i mean an example would be like  
something like the heating perhaps a lot of time 
you don't think about the heating but as soon as  
it breaks down it suddenly becomes manifest 
and kind of very much visible even though  
most of the time you're not really you know just 
kind of it just sort of works most of the time  
one of the ways to understand you become where 
it comes from is to understand that mark wiser  
was um reacting against what was very popular at 
the time so he developed ubicomp in the late 80s  
and early 90s virtual reality was a big deal at 
the time it was a kind of first wave of vr vr is  
doing this thing where we're taking people into 
the machine in a kind of very absorbing way and  
if you've been around anyone using a vr 
headset you'll know that it's very difficult to  
communicate with them and to have any kind 
of shared experience and so ubicomp was about  
taking the computing and putting it into the world 
embedding it into everything to avoid that problem  
of being absorbed into the machine so it's very 
much kind of of the view that technology should  
let us get the things done that we need to and not 
get in the way and so vr is very much the opposite  
that where the technology becomes the focus of 
attention so it must be seen in the context that  
historical context the reaction against um against 
vr really was mark weiser at somewhere like mit  
or or one of these places berkeley or something 
so mark weiser was uh kind of one of the it's  
best known basically as someone who was at xerox 
park now park is palo alto research center so  
xerox park was a division of xerox to the 
photocopier company who are still around park was  
very famous for establishing some of the core uh 
components i guess for elements of computing which  
are all very familiar with now park developed what 
looks like one of the first pcs effectively called  
the xerox alto you'll see it kind of looks like a 
desktop computer it's got a keyboard got a mouse  
it's a kind of well-known story that steve 
jobs went to park and had a look around  
and saw the alto and interface and took a 
bunch of things from it and implemented it into  
apple's range of machines and kind of famous 
for doing so but you know you saw something  
that seemed like it kind of worked really 
well and as any sensible person should do  
uh take that and use it in some kind of way so 
the history of um xerox park is really important  
because of because of that aspect i mean there's 
other aspects of the alto which are important like  
networking and so on crucially during the kind of 
late 80s and early 90s sort of bringing us up to  
mark wise's time xerox park was developing a 
load of different sorts of technologies around  
things like improvements in sort of networking 
mobility so sort of reducing sizes of things  
making devices more mobile um improving kind of 
their networking capabilities um dealing with  
issues around power those sorts of things they 
were developing all these different technologies  
and one of the issues was that mark weiser 
saw was that there was no coherent vision of  
all these different technologies and how 
they might fit together and he had this  
um this way of thinking which brought them 
together and that's what birthed this idea  
of ubi comp mark weiss's vision was to take uh or 
the ubcom vision was to take all these different  
disparate bits of technology that were being 
developed like you know wi-fi networking and  
better power management and more powerful 
computing and display technologies and all these  
sorts of things and bring them together into this 
vision of ubiquitous computing which was about  
you know computing being everywhere um with you 
on your old times uh in the woodwork so to speak  
as he put it um embedded into buildings embedded 
into you know all sorts of places vehicles those  
sorts of things in a way it's kind of partly like 
the world well elements of it are kind of a bit  
like the world we're living in now in the sense 
of you know cars have extremely sophisticated  
management systems some cars are connected 
to the internet all times we have internet  
of things technologies in our homes so smart 
bulbs smart heating systems whatever it might be  
we also have devices we carry around um with 
us you know all in all places so there's many  
ways in which the uh vision that he created of 
ubicomp actually is kind of with us today today  
certain elements of it so it's although at the 
time it was massive yes worth emphasizing how  
how ambitious it was as a vision at the time 
given that you know talking about the late 80s um  
there's no sense in which everyone had a desktop 
pc at that point necessarily at all so it's a very  
very different world i think that's if anyone's 
you know people who are watching us have to  
really understand if they weren't around then they 
have to understand how much of a different world  
it was and um and how much of a kind of visionary 
person he needs to be to bring the stuff together  
there's another aspect that's important about 
bringing all those technologies together and that  
was a kind of to do with the relationship between 
park itself and xerox now as with any and there's  
a story about the demise of the corporate um 
research lab which we can probably talk about in  
another video but um as with any kind of corporate 
research lab or any kind of facility like this he  
needs to justify his existence to um to xerox and 
one way to justify the development of these very  
interesting technologies was to say well actually 
part of a bigger vision and the vision was ubicomp  
and so that so not just it wasn't just that it 
had a purely had a function in terms of the kind  
of computer science elements but also this kind of 
um element of of how do you justify this work it  
actually occurring even at all so i think you know 
he's a really important figure because he brings  
together all these things and then obviously that 
leads to this idea of internet of things which is  
nowhere near as sophisticated in its vision 
as mark wise's original but there's no way  
it would really exist without the idea of ubicomp 
if you want to read a core text about you become  
you can read his really famous 1991 scientific 
american article called the computer for the 21st  
century it's not a hugely technical bit of writing 
so i'd encourage everyone to go and have a look at  
it it kind of lays out this vision the ubicomp 
vision very clearly about this world um in which  
we live in this kind of ubicomp world all these 
different sense technologies different bits of  
computing embedded into everything also you know 
goes through all the different challenges that  
are associated with this because we could talk at 
length about the some of the issues that it brings  
up so if we're doing ubiquitous computing 
we suddenly have issues around things like  
as mentioned already power becomes a real problem 
how do you power all these devices sensors  
how do you collect sensor data and then make 
sense of it at all because there's all this  
stuff flying around in terms of the data you're 
collecting how do you network stuff how do you  
ensure continuous provision of networking services 
these are all major problems still now obviously  
how do you get the adequate data science stuff to 
do the inference to make sure you understand the  
data you're getting back and then act on it how 
do you determine things like context these are  
really critical problems and what the kind of 
interaction techniques that you need to build  
to enable people to actually interact with these 
um always on always with you type devices or  
devices that are embedded into non-standard 
things like you know you're not expecting  
the wall to have a computer embedded into it 
what's the form of interaction that you might  
uh need to enable someone to interact with a wall 
in an appropriate way that's not a trivial thing  
to work out i mean it took a long time just to get 
to you know this sort of thing right um many many  
different prototypes were made to get to the mouse 
the surprising amount of work in something we now  
take for granted did mark weiser see his vision 
fulfilled what happened mark wise unfortunately  
died in 1999 so he died quite young um and uh you 
know so so he he would have seen the some of the  
fruits of what he'd created in terms of vision um 
i guess in terms of things like miniaturization  
and increased networking you know improvements in 
that technology and all those sorts of things but  
but i really think um you know he'll be missing 
out on the internet of things that we see now and  
there's a very direct line between that as i said 
between that and you become so i think there was a  
lot more to come basically that that he never saw 
unfortunately i i would argue here that the way  
that the internet of things has developed uh in 
a kind of ramshackle away from various different  
manufactures is far from his vision by from what 
i understand how do you go about testing a system  
like this when you're coming up with it from 
nowhere and these aren't kind of devices you  
can ship off to somebody to have a play with how 
do you go about making sure it does stuff that  
you wanted to do when they were building these 
different devices they talked about building  
technologies at different scales they had a 
very small scale post-it note scale through  
to a kind of ipad size scale through to a kind of 
whiteboard size scale and they kind of experiment  
with different technologies have been involved 
in building those things and making them work  
um in order to test them um they actually use 
themselves in their own work they sort of ate  
their own dog food so to speak in working with 
them they understood more about what it meant to  
live in this way with those technologies so that 
way in which they test it out themselves was very  
very important for um the kind of ubicomp vision 
and establishing the ubicomp vision for for others  
um and you know making it um seem like it's taken 
seriously which is we're so serious about this  
technology we're just going to use it ourselves 
and i think at the time that wasn't necessarily  
really one of those kind of practices that people 
would generally engage in they'll generally be  
um perhaps engaging users other people in in 
trials for a specific short amount of time  
and measuring various facets of of those of those 
trials those experiments drawing very badly here  
and so on so you'd have two sets of pulses 
one delayed from the other it's what we call  
quadrature encoding we can actually derive 
from that 1990 something or other this was  
this big crunch coming up that we're 
going to run out of ip addresses any
