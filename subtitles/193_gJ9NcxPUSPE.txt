last year on this channel i covered this
book and i said i thought it was the
best
introduction the best practical
introduction to machine learning
that i'd ever seen and i really do i
think it's an excellent book
and a lot of people agreed with me well
at the end of last year the second
edition of this book came out and here
it is
and the question is is this book as good
as the first edition
let's take a look i think this book is
even
better than the previous book it has 250
extra pages
let's take a look at the index so you
get an
overall description of machine learning
you then get an
end to em machine learning project so
what i like about this book
is that it starts at sort of a high
level and then you go into
more details differences from the other
book where we have this section on
uh unsupervised learning techniques
specifically k-means
and uh gaussian mixtures they weren't in
the previous one
and then the section on neural networks
has been expanded
and there's a nice section on deep
computer vision using convolutional
neural networks the book has also been
updated to cover tensorflow 2 and
carers i think this is even better than
the
first edition it has it's an expanded
version of the first edition and it has
all the strengths of the first edition
plus it covers extra topics
why do i like it i like the way it
starts with a high level
you know explanation of the field and
then you get in chapter two an
end to end machine learning project to
follow through this gives the rest of
the book context
the topics are very well explained
there's a lot of code
uh and you know code examples and it's
very well presented by the time you've
gone through this
you will understand the topic very well
and in practical terms you'll understand
how to
implement and build your own projects
some criticisms of the book are that
it's not for beginners you know it's a
little bit too advanced for beginners
and whilst you could argue that that is
true if you've never done any python
before
or you don't know linear algebra or a
little bit of calculus
you might get a bit lost but i think for
the
really motivated beginner it would be
very good so even if that is you even if
you don't know any python
you know you'll go away and learn enough
python to be able to do the book and and
if you don't know enough math you'll be
able to go away and learn enough math
it's the bar is set low enough for you
to be able to
teach yourself those things and then
pursue the book
but it is true that it's not for
absolute beginners
so if you feel that you're an absolute
beginner perhaps
just read up learn a little bit of
python and in just enough maths to be
able then to start using this book
the other thing about this book is that
it's for determined readers only if
you're just
a little bit interested in machine
learning and wondering here how it might
be implemented using python
this book won't be for you because you
know to be able to learn from this book
you've got to
be very motivated to want to get all the
way through it
the things in this book the topics that
are covered are you know they're
they're complex they're challenging and
they will require
thought this isn't bedtime reading it's
going to take you if you're a beginner
a good few months to get through it but
that's no bad thing because it's so
comprehensive
you'll know the subject very well and
you know in the uk it's 35
pounds which for such a comprehensive
book on the subject
i think is extremely good value and if
you look at the cost of
machine learning courses out there it
compares very
favorably to that so if you are a deter
you know if you're determined to learn
machine learning if you're very
motivated to learn machine learning
learning using python i would very much
recommend this book to you
