um well there's a few strategies to
consider and I think they're pretty much
you know Common sensical So Pro U you
know proactive vulnerability management
would be the main one I would suggest
prioritize vulnerability remediation
conducting regular security Audits and
penetration testing and that means by
the way using outside Consultants don't
have your own uh security team grading
themselves they're always going to be so
they're always going to get an A uh so
it's going to be an outside consultant
or someone doesn't have uh a
relationship with the existing team to
see how well those things are done and
those folks are out there uh strong
Access Control measures implementing
identity access management systems which
is always a smart thing to do
