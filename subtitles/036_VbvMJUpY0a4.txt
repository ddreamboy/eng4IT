So you want to become a web developer
and you start learning html, css,
and javascript. But then you start
hearing about these javascript
frameworks. Should I learn angular or
react.js, or maybe backbone, or vuejs, or
ember, or knockout, meteor, mithril, ractive,
polymer, svelte etc
So what are javascript frameworks and
why are there so many of them?
Front-end web development is all about
displaying things on a web page,
also known as rendering. Let's say we
have a list of youtube comments
and we want to render it on a web page
to look like this. We could create this
using html, and css,
but every video has different comments,
so we need to write different html for
every video on
youtube. A better solution is javascript
we save the comments in a javascript
object,
and then write some code to render it. If
we need to render different comments we
just swap out the comments.
Using plain javascript to implement this,
the code looks like this.
Using a framework, we can write our code
like this, and the framework converts
this into plain javascript for you.
And that's why we use frameworks, it
makes rendering so much easier.
So why are there so many frameworks.
Javascript doesn't have an official
framework like other languages,
so developers are free to create their
own, and boy did they make
lots of them. But if you want a job, you
need to learn the latest generation of
frameworks.
Like an iphone, frameworks are created in
generations, each generation
has more modern features than the
previous one. Right now the latest
generation is
react, vue, and angular so learn one of
these.
If you don't know which one to pick, you
can do a job search in the location you
want to work,
and learn the framework that comes up
most often. To learn a framework you can
go to its website and follow their
getting started guide.
And that's it! You're on your way to
becoming a highly paid web developer.
I've put the links for these frameworks
in the description for you to try out,
and you can check out this video for a
little more detail about frameworks.
