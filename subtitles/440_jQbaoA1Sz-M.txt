hi everyone welcome to tech in five
minutes
over the past decade the importance of
the software testing life cycle
or stlc has skyrocketed for us
it is crucial as it helps engineers
address bugs faster and more accurately
before we start make sure you are
subscribed if you don't want to miss our
upcoming videos
we share our team's insights into the
tech industry
let's now get back to our topic
software testing lifecycle means a
testing process which has specific steps
to ensure that the quality goals have
been met
why do we need a software testing
lifecycle the benefits of stlc
are the following direct project and
team organization
quality assurance predictable
development process
and quick error detection before we
analyze the stlc
process let's observe the main models of
software development lifecycle
as they directly influence the testing
process there are four common practices
agile model waterfall model v-model
spiral model let's review each of them
the main focus of agile is to adapt to
any changes and avoid long-term planning
we value agile for the transparency of
project delivery
this model involves testing as early as
possible
let's summarize its advantages instant
product delivery
users involvement in product development
constant communication
continuous improvement process less
planning
2. waterfall contrary to agile
methodologies
the waterfall model is about long-term
planning it works great for small
projects
don't you think that a stable
traditional approach is better than a
flexible one
share your thoughts in the comments
anyway the advantages of waterfall
are its review process and persistence
of linear testing
three v model this model is about
planning the expected results
right at the verification phase the v
model breaks down the testing phase into
detailed steps to ensure the validation
and verification process according to
our team's experience
the v model is rarely used these days
v-model benefits
include simplicity in use the test plan
is specified before coding
real-time error tracking defined user
role in the verification phase
and finally the spiral model this
methodology focuses on risk analysis
and spirals develop
good for complex projects ability to
manage risks at earlier stages

let's now review the process
of software testing life cycle phase 1
requirements analysis after product
requirements are set out
jelvik's testing teams try to evaluate
this information
and ensure that it works for the project
requirement analysis
includes the following activities
defining software features
setting testing priorities preparing
requirement traceability matrix
rtm it is used to track the requirements
and to check if the current project
requirements are met
and finally we perform identifying the
testing environment details
deliverable of this stage is requirement
traceability matrix
phase two test planning key activities
in this stage include assigning roles
and responsibilities
risk evaluation test tool selection and
cost analysis
deliverables of this stage are effort
estimation document
and test plan strategy document to
identify what we are testing
how and what are our outcomes
phase three test case development at
this stage
our team prepares and reviews test cases
automation scripts and creates test data
obviously deliverables here are test
cases and scripts
and test data phase four test
environment setup
once software build is deployed we
execute
environment setup software and hardware
configuration
and smoke test execution as a result
we get the environment ready with test
data set up and smoke test results
phase 5 test execution testers carry out
test script execution
test script maintenance and bug
reporting in case of bugs
the build is moving back to the
development team after bug fixing
we carry out regression testing
deliverables of test execution are
completed rtm with the execution status
test cases updated
and defect reports and finally comes
phase
six test cycle closure this is about
measuring results
so we conduct test results analysis
evaluation of test coverage quality
costs time and objectives criteria
and preparation of the final report
deliverables of the final phase are
test closure report and test metrics
and that's it if you're looking for an
expert qa team to secure your it project
look no further jelvix offers the most
advanced qa and testing services on the
market
we provide end-to-end software
development services
