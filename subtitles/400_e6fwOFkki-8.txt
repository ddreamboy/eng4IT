what are the tools in big data analytics
which tool is the best tool among all
how it will help organization in
analyzing the data these are the
questions you may arrive with by
watching this video you will be able to
understand all these hi this is sahana
from simply learn today we will learn
which is the best tool for big data
analytics before that
please make sure you subscribe to our

miss an update
let's go for today's agenda
first let's get introduced to what is
big data
applications of big data next comes
hadoop
after that tableau
kasandra
mongodb and lastly
spark
and let's get started with
what is big data
big data can be defined as the large
amount of data that is very hard to
analyze using traditional data handling
system like microsoft excel
data generated through new technologies
like smartphones self-driving cars
social media websites like facebook
instagram and computers are categorized
under big data
such data sets are very hard to process
using normal computing techniques
next comes applications of big data
big data is used in banking sector to
analyze complex data sets of customers
big data markets will analyze and
anticipate the customers liking while
maintaining their expenditure record
this will happen in ecommerce websites
like amazon flipkart metra etc next let
us go for best big data tools
most crucial tool is hadoop
hadoop is an open source tool written in
java that allows user to process large
amount of data hadoop uses a network of
computers to solve problems involving
large amount of data
hadoop is the best efficient tool to
store large amount of data sets
next let's go for features of hadoop
most important one is it is cost
efficient because hadoop runs on
inexpensive commodity servers with
associated storage a less expensive
design than our dedicated storage area
network
next is swiftness
data localization or the practice of
performing computation close to the data
rather than transporting the data itself
that is why hadoop is very fast
flexibility hadoop is extremely
adaptable in terms of its capacity to
handle various types of data sets like
it may be structured semi-structured
unstructured
all that can be handled efficiently
using hadoop
scalability a very scalable model is
hadoop in a cluster a sizable volume of
data is split among several affordable
processes and processed in
simultaneously
next let's understand the components of
hadoop there are mainly three major
components among hadoop
first among them is hadoop hdfs which is
also called as
hadoop distributed file system
next comes
map reduce
and the third is hadoop yarn
let's understand them in detail first is
hdfs
based on the google file system the
hadoop distributed file system offers a
distributed file system that is intended
to function on common hardware
it and current distributed file system
share a lot of similarities the
differences between this distributed
file system and others however are
substantial
hadoop is used in big organizations for
both research and production
hadoop also allows the transfer of data
between the nodes
these nodes can also be addressed as
name node and data node
next comes mapreduce
mapreduce is a processing technique used
in hadoop for distributing computing
with java as a programming language
important task of mapreduce is map and
reduce marg takes a set of data sets and
converts them into another set
whereas reduce converts them into small
set of tuples
next comes the third important component
that is yarn
important concept of yarn is to separate
the resource management operations
the concept of yarn is to have an
overall resource manager which is
shortly addressed as rm and an
application master for each application
which is shortly addressed as am
either a single job or a group of jobs
make up an application
this is all about components of hadoop
now let's go for data storage in hadoop
they are
in the form of racks first is rack 1
next comes
rack 2
rack 3 and rack 4. let's see how data is
analyzed
here block a is splitted as
blocking and another blockade in rack 2
and block b is splitted in block 3.
same case for block c
as well as block d and e
this is how data storage is very simple
in hadoop
next comes crucial big data tool called
tableau
tableau is one that tool that aids in
maintaining a data pool
they have 40 distinct data sources that
can have linked to
tableau software is an american
interactive data visualization company
focuses on business intelligence
to visualize data while conducting
business intelligence analysis
organizations employ tableau tableau's
product range consists of
visible
tableau public tableau server tableau
desktop tableau online and tableau
mobile it is used to visualize the data
and explore different views tableau is
applied in analyzing high volumes of
data
next let's go in detail about features
of tableau
tableau dashboard tableau dashboards use
text graphic objects visualizations and
other elements to give you a complete
picture of your data dashboards can show
data as stories allow the addition of
various views and object it also offers
a range of layouts and formats and allow
user to apply appropriate features
these features make dashboards
particularly informative
data sharing among tableau
tableau offers simple way for users to
work together and rapidly share the data
in the form of visualizations sheets
dashboards etc you can use it to safely
share the data from many different
sources including hybrid on-premise and
on cloud
tableau provides advanced visualization
technique for detailed visualization of
data
data and user security are given great
considerations by tableau for data
communications and use cases it has a
full proof security system based on
authentication and permission methods
these are all some of the important
features provided by tableau
this is a simple glimpse of
tableau dashboard
next comes cassandra
apache cassandra is an open source tool
which is having no sql database that is
used for handling big data
apache cachandra has the capability to
handle structured semi-structure and
unstructured data
it allows for storage and retrieving of
data apache kasundra was originally
developed at facebook after that
it was open sourced in 2008. cassandra
is an apache product it is an open
source distributed and decentralized
storage system it is used to manage very
large amount of structured data spread
out across the world it provides high
availability with no single point of
failure
features of cassandra
cassandra is a very highly scalable tool
and allows more hardware utility
cassandra provides flexible data storage
and it supports all possible data
formats like structured semi-structured
as well as unstructured data
cassandra provides
simple data distribution it is very
simple and also provide application
factor
operations or table operations in
cassandra
first is creating a table
command used to create a table that is
create table and emp1 is the name of the
table
which has data sets like
id and name of the employee
in cassandra you can also drop a table
like any other sql language
it includes a simple command
dot table employee 1
next is altering a table
it can be done using simple command alt
table and table name that is employee 1
next is truncating a table
to do this operation you have to select
the table and truncate the table
with by using the command truncate
employee 1
these are all the important or key table
operations performed in cassandra
this is how cassandra will look like
next comes very famous
nosql database tool which is called as
mongodb
mongodb is a
document based versatile and scalable
nosql database management system that
uses key value sets to store data and it
also supports many data models
it was created as a way to deal with
enormous amount of dispersed data that
relational database
or relational data models which
typically provides rows tables
that cannot handle well mongodb is free
and open source just like hadoop
features of mongodb
data replication is the key feature of
mongodb
it creates replica data sets to enable
fault tolerance data is kept on many
servers using replication which offers
high availability and redundancy
data storage
like cassandra and hadoop it can also
store any type of data sets like
semi-structured unstructured and
structured
next comes
storage ending it employs multiple
storage engines thereby ensuring the
right engine is used for the right
workload which in turn enhances
performance
it is a powerful query language that
enables cred operations which stands for
create read update and delete operations
text search and aggregation functions
due to embedded data models it requires
less input and output procedures than
relational databases faster queries are
also supported by mongodb indexes
these are all the key features of
mongodb
this is a glimpse of mongodb compass
next comes spark
fast cluster computing called apache
spark is made for quick computation
it was constructed on top of hadoop
mapreduce and expands the mapreduce
concept to utilize other
functions like calculations including
interactive queries and stream
processing
spark is a very flexible and easy to use
tool
let's go and understand
main important components of spark first
among them is spark shell
spark offers an interactive shell a
potent tool for interactive data
analysis you can get it in either python
or scala language a distributed
collection of items known as resilient
distributed datasets that is rdd
rdd can be produced by altering existing
rdds or by using hadoop input formats
which is
like hdfc files
rdd transformations you can establish
dependencies between rdds by using rdd
transformation which returns a pointer
to a new rdd in a dependency chain each
rdd includes a function for computing
its data as well as dependency to its
parent rdd
spark core
the basic functionality of spark is
carried out via spark core it contains
the parts necessary for managing memory
interacting with the storage system
recovering from errors and scheduling
tasks
next comes spark sql
on top of spark core spark sql is
constructed support for structured data
is also offered both the sql or
structured query language and hql apache
high variation of sql are supported for
data querying
next comes machine learning library
a machine learning library called mlib
or mlip includes a variety of machine
learning algorithms these comprise
principal component analysis
classification regression clustering
correlations and hypothesis testing
compared to apache monarchs it is nine
times quicker
spark stages
this is a glimpse of
spark stages
