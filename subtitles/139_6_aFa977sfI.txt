if you use microsoft excel to analyze
data at work
you use piv tables and charts and things
like that but you
need more power you are interested in
answering
more complicated more impactful business
questions with data then this is the
video for you
in this video i'm going to go through my
top four data mining techniques using
microsoft excel and what's so awesome
about data mining with excel is that any
professional can do it
and i mean any professional i don't care
if you work in hr
or finance marketing supply chain i.t
product management
whatever these techniques are useful for
any professional that wants to have more
impact at work with data analytics
so what i will do is i will go through
my top four techniques for data mining
with excel in this video
just so you know i have tutorials
in-depth tutorials for all four of these
techniques on my channel
so i'm not going to go into too much
detail in this video but what i will do
is reference the appropriate video that
i have on my channel at that particular
point in time just in case you're
interested
in diving deeper and learning more about
the techniques
so let's go ahead and get started with
number one on the list and that is
exploratory data analysis so here i am
in excel and i want to show you what i
mean when i talk about exploratory data
analysis
typically what this means is grabbing a
data set
and formulating some sort of very
interesting or potentially
impactful business question and to
really exemplify this what i've got here
is a famous data set this happens to be
a machine learning data set by the way
just so you know
around titanic passengers and the
question
the relevant and impactful business
question with this data is hey
are there any patterns in the data that
are highly associated or highly
predictive
of survival even though this is a
titanic machine learning data set
don't think of it that way just think of
it as a proxy for customer data
and let's say the example question you
have is hey is a customer going to
convert to paying
is a customer going to buy more is a
customer going to churn and leave us for
a competitor
these are the types of awesome questions
that you can answer using excel
and exploratory data analysis techniques
and i'm just going to briefly show you
some examples of what i'm talking about
so i've got the data here and
the business question that we're trying
to answer is hey what
types of patterns in the data are highly
predictive
highly associated with survival one of
the first things that you can do
is create what's known as a histogram
which is a particular kind of data
visualization and you can see an out of
the box
histogram right here and these are
useful but what's even better
is when you actually use a pivot chart
as a histogram and what you get is a
much much more powerful data
visualization to help you answer
questions now
check this out so you can see here i've
got the ages of the passengers on the
titanic
and the colored bars here in the
histogram tell you the orange
or the survival rates and the blue are
for the folks unfortunately that didn't
make it
but here's the thing check it out you
can use these slicers and you can say
look i'm interested in only
females or males and only males let's
say females in
first class i mean look at that look how
it just changes and it shows you that
wow
females and first class overwhelmingly
survive
this is the kind of exploratory data
analysis that isn't commonly
done by most excel users but is totally
easy to do in excel
and super super powerful but there's
more so for example there's another type
of data visualization
known as a box plot what this shows you
essentially is is what is the range of
age values in the data set
based on whether someone didn't make it
they perished or they survived
powerful stuff right because what you
can see here is
okay generally speaking those that
survived they kind of skewed to be
younger
imagine that and then lastly and this is
just one more example
is a scatter plot which is you know just
these dots but notice what i've done
here
is i've color coded these dots here
to represent whether or not someone
survived or perished and what you can
see is
the age on one axis in the family size
how many people
were traveling together on the titanic
and what you can see here clearly
is that it's kind of a mixed bag right
it's like okay if your family size is
big and your
age is young maybe you have a tendency
to perish
which might make some sense based on the
nature of the data but all that to say
exploratory data analysis is the
fundamental thing if you want to uplevel
your data analytics game
and in excel it is wildly easy and as i
mentioned i have a whole
series of tutorials on exploratory data
analysis i'll put the playlist up here
this is number one on the list if you're
only going to do one thing out of the
four in this video
this is the thing to do exploratory data
analysis
so after exploratory data analysis with
excel which is super awesome
the next thing on the list number two on
the list
is market basket analysis and
if you're not familiar market basket
analysis is a quintessential data
analysis technique
used in the grocery store and retail
industries however
it is super powerful you can do all
kinds of things with it so let's pop
over to excel and let me show you what i
mean
here i am in excel and once again i'm
going to be using
the titanic data set here as the frame
of reference
and that's only to cement this idea that
you can use market basket analysis
in excel to mine all kinds of data and
generate
new and powerful insights so once again
in this particular case what we're
interested in
is trying to find out what
characteristics of individual
titanic passengers were highly
associated with survival
and once again just think of this like
customer data and the number of
questions you can
answer with market basket analysis is
immense
i'm going to go ahead and ignore most of
this because
i have a tutorial on my channel which i
will put
right up here for you to take a look at
and what you can see here is an example
of market basket analysis
in action and what i've asked excel to
do for me
in this market basket analysis is to say
look it survived all right i want you to
hold that steady i want you to find out
everything else to the left of this
particular
cell that is highly associated with the
thing in the cell
and survival in this case market basket
analysis is super powerful
what you can see here is i'm only asking
excel to find the top two things that
are highly associated with survival
but i don't have to only have two i
could have three or four or five this is
where market basket analysis becomes
really really super powerful
and what happens in this particular
analysis is that excel said okay dave
i will find the top two things based on
the data that we saw
in the table that are highly associated
with
survival and they are being an adult
female
and what this tells me over here at this
point here
the lift this this is what this is
what's so awesome about market basket
analysis
what this tells me is based on the data
that i have
that if you're an adult female you are
1.99
basically two times twice as likely to
survive
this is the power of market basket
analysis in action
and it doesn't have to be titanic
passengers right it could be anything so
for example if you work in product
management
you could list the features in your
software application and say okay
of all these different combinations of
software features which ones are most
highly associated with people
not only signing up for our software
service but also stick around and pay us
month after month after month for a long
period of time
there are scenarios in hr and
manufacturing
in logistics you name it market basket
analysis is a
wildly wildly useful tools so that's why
it's number two on the list
and not surprisingly once again i've got
a tutorial for this up here if you're
interested in learning more about market
basket analysis but this is the thing
you should tackle
next after exploratory data analysis
after market basket analysis number
three on the list the third thing that
you might find
super super useful as a professional
looking to have more
impact at work with data is cluster
analysis
and in particular the k-means algorithm
for cluster analysis
is easily implemented in excel and is
quite powerful
and to kind of give you some sort of
idea of what goes on with cluster
analysis let me flip over to powerpoint
for a quick intro this is a contrived
example to be sure
but it illustrates the idea of cluster
analysis
the idea is that you have a pile of data
and what you want to do is you want to
say look
are there any patterns in the data are
there any associations are there any
groupings in that data
that maybe i'm not aware of that might
be potentially useful
a quintessential example of using
cluster analysis
is what is known as customer
segmentation so for example you have a
big pile of customer data
and what you want to do is group them
into groups and then take a look at
those groups and say
what are the characteristics of this
group that makes it different from this
group and
is this group more likely to buy or more
likely to do xyz
that sort of thing so cluster analysis
is super useful but it goes way beyond
just customer segmentation
for example in supply chain using
cluster analysis
in logistics is an awesome awesome
technique
so this is a contrived example and what
you can see here obviously
are clusters right two obvious clusters
one right here
one right here but what's super
interesting in cluster analysis
is actually situations like this this
data point right here
and just just be clear this is a very
very contrived example because
notice that i'm only using two
dimensions here an x-axis
and a y-axis two dimensions but in a
real-world cluster analysis scenario
you might use four dimensions or five
dimensions
or seven dimensions and by the way just
think of a dimension as a column of data
in an excel table the more columns that
you're using the more dimensions you
have and then of course obviously it
gets more and more complicated to find
these groupings effectively so we're
just going to use two dimensions here
because
that's basically all powerpoint can
handle
so what's going to happen is that we
would run a k-means
clustering algorithm on this data and
obviously it's going to find this
cluster in this cluster but the question
is what's going to happen to that data
point right here
what's gonna happen to the data point
and if you run the k-means
algorithm you see here that it decides
that eventually it becomes
an orange dot so it becomes part of this
cluster right here which is colored
orange and you've got this one
down here just in case you're curious
this
big orange dot and this big green dot
they're cluster centers
i go into detail in the video up here on
k-means cluster analysis with excel to
explain what these mean in more detail
for our purposes right now we don't care
what happens is that k-means
iterates through the data over and over
and over again until it finds all the
data and assigns it to all the clusters
that you specify
this is a super super useful algorithm
k-means is very easy to implement in
excel
all you need is basic functions tables
of data and just a little bit of power
query
and like i said i've got a video up here
this tutorial goes into how you can do
this
in depth cluster analysis is a wildly
useful skill to have and which is why
it's number three
on the list k-means clustering wildly
useful that's why it's number three on
the list
the last and final technique number four
on the list is naive bayes
classification now if you're not
familiar with classification
just think of it as a way of analyzing
your data
to create a predictive model that allows
you to decide
whether something's good or bad yes no
approve
deny that sort of thing and in this
particular case what i'm going to show
you is
a naive base classifier that allows you
to predict whether or not an sms
text message is ham a legitimate text
message from one of your friends or
family members
or it's spam something bad
right hey buy this or whatever it might
be so let's flip over to excel and let
me show you a naive bayes classifier in
action
all right here i am in excel where i've
implemented a naive bayes classifier
and as with all of these techniques
here's my tutorial video up
here in case you want to learn more
about naive bayes
now all we're going to look at is this
particular table of data right here
which says okay i've taken my existing
data
i've used excel to build a naive bayes
classifier to determine whether or not a
text message is ham or spam
ham being good spam being bad and what
this
table shows you is hey if a new text
message comes in
with this particular words in it or if
this message came
in with those particular words in it
whether or not it is ham or spam and
what you can see here
are the predictions based on the text
messages that came in so for example
call claim you get home that is based on
the data that we had to build this
classifier we are going to predict that
that's ham that that's legit
however if we get a message like this
text call free claim mobile you can get
love home
no the video the tutorial will go into
more detail this is a contrived example
but just just roll with me on this
so if you got this particular text
message based on the data that we had
to build this classifier we would
predict that that's actually a spam
message
and by the way just so you know this is
the same type of tools and techniques
that are used for email as well to
determine whether or not you're giving
junk or spam email
and put it automatically in your junk
spam folder
even though a spam filter this is what
this is called by the way a spam filter
is a classic use case for naive bayes
classifiers
it can be anything it doesn't have to be
this it could be
for example uh is a customer going to
churn
is a customer going to leave us for a
competitor yes or no
you can use a naive bayes classifier to
predict that sort of thing
this thing is wildly useful the number
of business scenarios that boil down
to a yes no approved deny
legitimate fraudulent kind of scenario
it's immense
and it's across everything hr hr it's a
great example so in hr
you could say for example i want to
create a naive bayes classifier
that predicts whether or not a good
employee
is going to quit and go to work for one
of our competitors which is kind of like
a custom return scenario if you think
about it
that's the kind of thing that you can do
with your data in excel
with this technique naive bayes is
awesome that's why it's number four on
the list of cool data mining techniques
that are wildly useful
for any professional okay i'm going to
put up a couple more of my videos right
here just in case you're interested in
learning more about what's
possible in terms of more advanced
analytics with excel there you have it
my top four data mining techniques in
excel for any professional if you want
to
up level your data analysis game these
are the things to focus on
i hope you enjoyed the video i hope you
found this useful until next time
please stay healthy and i wish you very
happy day to sleuthing
