have you ever wondered how to get
multiple versions of python on your
machine well P EnV is a fantastic tool
to help install and manage multiple
versions of python to install pemv is
very simple on Mac you can use Homebrew
to install it on Linux you can just curl
down the script unfortunately Windows is
not supported at that time of writing
but there is a Windows equipment called
pv-wind after setting some shell scripts
you're ready to use it to install a
specific python version type py EnV
install and the specific python version
and in this case case I did python 3.10
to set a version type py EnV Global and
the specific python version to verify it
works you just type python 3-- version
now you can download different versions
and switch between them
