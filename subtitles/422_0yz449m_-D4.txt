all right good morning good afternoon
good evening everybody wherever you are
watching this live session from my warm
regards and welcome to this live session
on AI ethics that is responsible Ai and
um this program is hosted by Machine
learning you also in collaboration with
the me for um machine learning Aban and
today we have our speaker already
am who is going to take us on this
session on responsible AI so we have
been building a lot of machine Learning
System we have been using AI systems in
our lives
and but how does this really um affect
our lives and have we taken into
consideration the ethical concerns of
these systems so in this tutorial we are
going to
because we are going to look into AI
ethics as well as responsible
ai ai is the new trange in the world
from Health Care to energy through
Insurance
Transportation marketing and
more this integration requires many more
processes that need to be paid attention
to because the final custo customer is
human so most of these Services we are
bu and most of this most of these
Integrations the final consumer is
actually human and regarding the process
AI ethics and responsible AI comes in
first and it helps to prevent harm and
make better decisions so in this session
we will learn how to use AI ethics and
what are the responsible AI practices in
the AI project so trust me and in this
live session we have a lot to cover and
I mean thank you very much our speaker
am from machine
Le I think
it's yeah yeah come
on yeah hello hello Victor thank thank
you very much can can
can yeah yeah I wanted to
your okay okay okay let's go let's
go is a tech blogger is a machine
learning expert and also a deep learning
expert or you can also find him as
DJ info and he has a masters in B he's
currently a master student in B
information B informatics he's currently
a b informatics student at udm
University I'm also a certified tens
flow developer so um I'm well yeah thank
you very much for finding time to join
the session today and
with
session ah thank you thank you thank you
to intr introduce me um hello everyone
uh welcome to the session and uh thank
you to machine learning Q for invitation
to speak about
um oh uh you remove me okay
um to talk about uh responsible Ai and
the AI ethics my so you know my name is
machine learning Aion leads and data
scientist at VD
info um what about a effect um a effects
um is a some process uh to to allow
people or maybe um machine learning
teams to identify the hars to decide if
you can breed or not the this AI system
yeah you know um is very important
before to breed and the AI system to
know
um what's the goal of the AI you want to
build that is very important you
know because uh
sometimes um you don't need to bre I
think
system to address some problem you have
uh you facing so uh maybe traditional
meth method is
um is
[Music]
cor is um maybe you need what's
about
okay to address some so every time um AI
system uh is
not okay is not
um uh I can say is not um appropriate to
to use it but when you decide
to to bre the AI system and uh we have a
problem
to know if
the
me okay
one thing you you you should know about
uh hega ethic is about human cens design
uh when you build your system um you
need to know um why you you want to
build a system design system to save
people in needs first of all is very
important um people
human uh should be in the center of your
design or your AI uh system design that
is very important for people who follow
the course on kle you know about human
Cent
design secondly you need to identify
bias um use a ethical AI or ethic of AI
in the when you bre uh something machine
learning system or machine AI system um
identify buers um is a model that
identify a toxic text apply the process
of maybe
Pro the things about a EIC help you to
investig in uh to identify buyers and
build a system a model that identify
stes text that's
that is a very very important uh for the
people want to build um AI
system what is about uh responsible AI
uh best way responsible AI apply the the
practics of responsible AI is the best
way to build a fairness interpretability
prevy and safety in AI
system um when you talk about AI system
you you need to focus on machine
learning model because the that is the
main
um um the main subject the main topic in
um machine learning when so sometimes
when you talk about a syst you talk
about machine learning models you
know finess AI what is about finess um
finess AI so when you talk about
finess um
you talk about build the AI system you
can address the goals uh yeah you know
and uh you can
um you can identify the main goals uh
for what you want to build a AI system
and at the end of the of the building of
the conception of the of the AI system
the model the machine learning model uh
should be um capable to address the
goals not uh to use for another goals
because sometimes when you you use the
AI system for another
G instead the gos for what is
building it can harms uh can brings hars
in the in the in the results on the
performance of of a model so it's very
important um to use it AI system
according Google AI system are enable
new um experience and ability for people
um around the the globe Beyond Recs
short videos in TV show a have been used
for more critical tasks such as BR
presence or severity of medical
condition matching people to jobs and
partner or identify if a person if a
person is crossing the
street um such compe as or decision Mak
c um have a potential to be more F or
more inclusive at
broader you know that SCS theoric design
making
process based on hard
any
bias equal opportunity equal that
is some um techniques to which we can
question understand and cross a
AI um sometimes uh when you have uh
interpretability automated prediction
decision making can improve life uh in
number of ways from recommending music
you like to monitoring a patient Vital
Signs consist this is why
interpretability or level of which you
can question understand and Trust in an
AI system
yeah
um
also interpretability also reflects our
domain knowledge you know um and
societal values provide scientist and
engineer which better yeah you know
means of Designing developing and de
models and help to ensure that a system
are working as
intent uh some techniques uh to breath
uh a machine learning can be
uh can be used interpret that is a
pushing interpret before during and
after breing the AI system inability
trat ability has a core of user
experience you know that design the
model to be interpretable and choice of
a metrix is that very important
sometimes uh when you build a AI system
you we we forgot this um techniques or
we forgot this practice uh to make a uh
our model to be um um to reach out the
level of you can question understand
interest in AI system
privacy uh what about privacy in
responsible AI uh that is um an AI
system which the mod can be quite
sensitive well what does that mean about
that um when you say about privacy uh
you can say m mod ml model um learn from
training data and make prediction on
input data you know sometimes we tring
data input data or both can be quite
sensitive Al for um there may be
anonymous uh benefits uh to breed a
models that operate sorry that operate
on sensitive data like concer detector
training or responsibility Sal data set
of B biy image sometimes and deployed on
individual passion case scans is
essential to consider the potential
privacy implication in using sensitive
data this
include this include um not only
respecting the legal and reg regulatory
uh requirement but also consider social
norms and typical individual
expectation uh some practics uh to make
or maybe to
um to have a system privacy that a COR
and handle data
responsib leverage on device
proing way appropriate appropriately
save for the privacy of mods and for
that uh you can see in
um in the K course uh about uh human C
design you have on
the I think on the
six on the sixth Point breed a safety
measure they say that safety measure
protect user against harm they seek to
limit uned behavior and accident by
ensuring that a system will be deliver
high quality outcomes this can only be
this only be um only be ACH from fruit
extensive and continuous Evolution and
texting design process around your area
system to continue continuously monitor
performance delivery of inchange
benefits reduction of arms air fairness
metric and any change in our people are
actually using it the kind of safety me
measures your system needs to needs
depend on um it P purpose on the type of
arms you can CL start by rev reviewing
the list of safety measure built in into
similar no a project or service then
review your every analysis of potential
har of you using a system um of using a
in your system that is very important uh
to to to do that uh when you you
bre your your privacy on the on privy on
AI system Safety and Security um in Ur
AI system be
have intend regardless
[Music]
of our attack try to interfere in the
system um it essential to consider in
address with safety and of on a syst
before is widely R in point safy
critical application there are many um
there are many challenge un need to to
the Safety and Security of AI system for
example is ADS is hard it is hard to
predict all
scenario the time when machine learning
is applied to problem that's that
difficult for human to solve and
especially so in the area of generative
AI you know is also hard to build system
that provide both necessary proactive
rtion for safety as well as the
necessary flexibility to generate uh
creative solution of or adapt to un
input so as AI technology evolves so we
security use as attacker we Sur find new
means to attack and the new solution we
need to develop in
tendem um internet below um our below
her our current current recommendation
from what you have learn so far
um many practics to for Safety and
Security a that is identify potential
threats to the system develop an
approach to combat threats keep learning
to say he heard the the curve is about
that you need
to is um in French they say that uh that
is a technology um the technology R
technology surveillance um you know that
stay up stay up to to date on the latest
um on the latest um research Advantage
Advance Research into adversor machine
learning continue to offer improved
performance for defense on some defense
technique are beginning or to Pro
guarantee Beyond interfer with input is
possible is possible to make the holder
vulnerability and the Machine learning
apply supply chain supply chain while um
to our knowledge uh such in attack has
not yet occurred it's important uh to
consider um the possibility and be
prepared is very important for
people so um what is the main uh things
you I want
to I want you
you I want uh you want to to to keep uh
before the the end of of the session um
before you want to build uh AI system
you need
to to use some process to apply uh a um
ethic of ethic AI uh process techniques
um in your in your process of breathing
um or building of AI system after that
during building uh your a system you
need to apply responsible AI techniques
you need to practice them uh to make
sure um
the AI
system uh for you want to bre people um
address
specifically the goal for what is
building for what is
build is very important because actually
you have um a war around uh machine
learning Ai Ai and the big company big
tech company um have a lot of money to
invest in the breed to get Innovation or
maybe to to control the AI in the many
space or maybe to to reach the top of
the top of AI company so it's very
important um to apply EIC of EIC AI in
during before to build a u a AI system
and during um and after uh breeding AI
system you need to use responsible AI
some practics that is a very important
for people because um had the hand
of of of the chain of produ of the CH on
the chain of um AI building you have a
human you have a people and uh you know
people are very
complicated you have people across the
the world with different culture
different habit um different idea
different FS so it's very important to
have a AI system to address
specifically um or maybe to to have in
the in the process
um or maybe the model machine learning
uh can be aware about that about um
people tradition uh people culture
people habit people food and um that is
a very important uh to
big company or maybe for
developers uh AI team in the company to
use um AI uh EIC Ai and the responsible
AI to build the system so you can find
some resource uh on Google
responsibility area practice uh online
or maybe Carle on the last uh course
lesson of the machine learning challenge
um is about AI ethic that's the
introduction of AI ethic
so um that is my presentation if you
have uh some question or maybe you have
uh some um some point to add to my
presentation um you can reach me on
um for my mail AR Aras AR Aras vino.com
or maybe on L AR on X for Twitter AR
Aras
AR um thank you very much
uh thank you very much to attending my
sis and uh I expect you you learn and
the to practice uh AI uh EIC Ai and
responsible AI in your
and maybe enterpr on team on AI team
thank you very
much thank you very much I'm Y for the
um for the session today
on AI ethics and responsible AI talked
about uh you know talking about AI
safety responsible Ai and ensuring
privacy of these systems so um if you
