what is cloud computing
cloud computing refers to the delivery
of Computing Services
including servers storage databases
networking software and more over the
internet
the cloud
instead of owning and maintaining
physical servers or data centers cloud
computing allows you to
access and use resources as needed on
the pay-as-you-go basis
two benefits of cloud computing
some of the key advantages of cloud
computing are
cost savings
pay for what you use
avoiding The Upfront cost of hardware
and infrastructure
scalability
easily scale resources up or down based
on demand
accessibility
access your applications and data from
anywhere with an internet connection
flexibility
choose from a variety of cloud service
models
to suit your specific needs
reliability
leaving Cloud providers
offer high uptime and redundancy to
ensure continuous availability
three cloud service models
there are three primary cloud service
models
infrastructure as a service is
provides virtualized Computing resources
over the internet
users can rent virtual machines storage
and networking components to build their
own I.T infrastructure
platform as a service bus
a platform allowing customers to develop
run
and manage applications without the
complexity of building and maintaining
the underlying infrastructure
software as a service says
delivers software applications
over the internet on a subscription
basis users can access the software
through a web browser without needing to
install or manage it locally
4. Cloud deployment models
cloud computing can be deployed in
different ways
public cloud
services are offered over
the public internet and shared among
multiple customers
it's managed by a third-party cloud
provider
private cloud
infrastructure is dedicated
to a single organization and can be
managed internally or by a third-party
provider
hybrid cloud
combines public and private clouds
allowing data and applications to be
shared between them
Community cloud
shared by several organizations with
similar requirements
such as Regulatory Compliance
5. popular Cloud providers
some of the major cloud service
providers are
Amazon web services else
Microsoft azure
Google Cloud platform gcp
IBM cloud
Oracle cloud
6. Asic Cloud terminology
versions of computing resources
such as servers storage and networks
scalability
the ability to handle increased or
decrease Demand by adjusting resources
elasticity
automatically scaling resources based on
workload fluctuations
redundancy
duplicating critical components to
ensure High availability
and reliability
load balancing
Distributing incoming Network traffic
across
multiple resources to optimize
performance
7. security and privacy in cloud
computing
Cloud providers Implement various
security measures
but customers must also take steps to
protect their data
encryption access controls and regular
audits are
some common practices
8 cloud computing use cases
cloud computing is used for various
purposes including
web hosting
host websites and web applications on
the cloud
data storage and backup
store and backup data securely in the
cloud
development and testing
create development and testing
environments quickly
big data analytics
process and analyze large volumes of
data efficiently
iot applications
Support internet of things devices and
applications
9. getting started with cloud services
sign up for an account with a cloud
provider and explore their service
offerings
you can create virtual machines deploy
applications
and use various cloud services
10. challenges and considerations in
cloud computing
address issues such as cost management
data security
vendor lock-in and performance when
using cloud services
11. future Trends in cloud computing
stay updated on the latest developments
in cloud computing such as Edge
Computing serverless architectures and
advances in a integration
