what's going on everybody welcome back
to another video today we are starting
our tableau tutorial series
[Music]
now this series is for absolute
beginners so if you have never used
tableau before you are in the perfect
place i'm going to take you all the way
from the very beginning of installing it
and just understanding what tableau is
and how you can use it all the way to
creating dashboards and sharing it now
personally i hate those videos that are
like three hours long and they just
expect you to go through it i like to
break my videos up into chunks so if you
have ever done my sequel tutorials
you'll know that i like to break things
up so it gives you time to try them out
and do them yourself and then you can
move on to the next video so i'm gonna
be breaking this up into five separate
videos but in this video i'm going to
show you how to install tableau for free
i'm going to show you the user interface
we're going to download a data set that
you can find on kaggle and then we will
build our first visualization together
with that being said let's jump over my
screen and we'll get started all right
so the very first thing that we need to
do is you need to actually download
tableau so we're not going to be using
tableau we're going to be using a free
version called tablet public it has a
lot of the same features except of
course it's not
every single feature that regular
tableau has but it is absolutely perfect
for learning it and for using it and and
you can even build um you know
dashboards and share those for your
portfolio
um i'm going to put this link in the
description so you can just go and click
on that and all you have to do is input
your email right here and click download
the app um and then it should start to
download and then you can save that and
then you're gonna open this up now
i'm gonna open it up i don't know what
it's going to do i already have it
downloaded um but it should open up and
look hopefully like what you're seeing
on
my screen in just a second
let's see what it does
um i hope you can see this but it says
tableau public
it says i already have it set up but
you're gonna click install and go
through all that um all that setup stuff
uh so i'm gonna exit out of here
i'm gonna go over here and type in
tableau public
and it's 20 21.3 that's the current
version that they have out if you're
doing this in the future they may have
you know different versions
so you should be able to pull this up
right here now
i'm going to
go and get our data set that we're going
to be using and i'm going to show you
how to get that as well and then we will
actually jump into tableau and start
using it
so let's go over here i'm going to get a
data set from kaggle i wanted something
pretty generic
to show you in future videos i'm going
to show you some special or not special
but just different visualizations that
you might use
and we'll get different data sets for
those because of course not one data set
covers all these other types of
visualizations so
we're starting off pretty simple right
here we're going to be getting one
called video game sales
and
we can take a really quick look at it um
here are some of the fields that you're
going to be having
like rank name platform the year genre
and then some sales data
and this is what it actually looks like
it's called vg sales so video game sales
and then csv
and um you know here are the fields
and we have our data and all we are
going to do is we're going to download
that
and i will save it now when you download
it it's going to be saved into a zip
file so we need to go to our downloads
uh let's refresh this
here's our archive we need to go in here
you can just copy it
and paste it right back into here
um and just so you know that is a
a csv so be aware of that
so what we want to do is you want to
come in here now since it is a csv this
is not we're not going to be using
microsoft excel we're going to be using
the text file so we'll come in here
we'll take vg sales now i uh one thing i
want to do before i do that is i'm going
to rename mine
uh vgs
sales underscore one
i've already
prepared for this and so i already have
that in there but so i want to make a
distinct one for myself you do not have
to do that so we'll come back here
um and then we're going to do text file
and vg sales
we're going to open that up
and
when it pulls up right here
you can bring in other tables and then
you can start to join them together and
create those relationships we are not
going to be doing that in this video
we'll do that in a separate one
as for you know just getting started you
know we're not going to be using that
but you can see
some of these
things
or some of these fields
and if you notice they
they um
they're either abc or they're a number
so it starts to categorize
what this field type is so is it a
string is it numeric it starts to
automatically do that and that's all
done within tableau
and so it just kind of reads it and
that's what it does
what we're going to do is when i click
right down here it's called go to
worksheet
the worksheets are where you're going to
actually start being able to build your
visualizations your charts your graphs
all these things
and so you know we have this in here now
and so we're just going to click right
here
on go to worksheet as you can see here
is vg sales underscore one
you will not have the underscore one if
you did not add that like i did
but right down here you can see all the
fields that we just imported from that
data set and they even created one right
here for us they just generated that
field
based on the file so it's a count of all
the rows really
so what i'm going to do is i'm just
going to walk you through
basically what we're looking at some of
the things that we're going to be using
today there will be things that i don't
talk about but i'm going to highlight
those instead in in future videos when
we start using those or going over them
um and so let's just start with the most
obvious one it's way over here i'm sure
you saw it when we uh this first came up
on the screen because it has all these
different charts and visualizations and
graphs and
these will become available as you start
dragging and dropping our data into this
sheet
and so if i go right here it says four
scatter plots try zero or more
dimensions two to four measures so what
our dimensions are are right here and
what our measures are are right down
here
and so typically uh things like like you
say genre or names or strings like that
are going to be
these dimensions and then a lot of a lot
of times the numerical is going to be
are going to be measures
next what i want to show you is right
here so you can take something like
global sales and you can drag it right
here into your rows
and then it
takes your rows and so it automatically
created a sum of global sales now if we
take that away let's say we drag it
right here it's going to give us a
column
now you can also do it right up here you
don't have to
drag it on screen
you can also
just add it to the column or the row
that's typically what i do i it's just
more intuitive to me
or you can drop it in this section right
here and it does its best to assign it
some type of
some type of visualization and so that's
what it always is trying to do it is
trying to say okay this is what you're
trying to do let me try to
get the best visualization for the data
that you're giving me
now while we are here
it went down here into marks and marks
is a very important area
it's where you can add color size text
detail and tool tip and i'm not going to
go into what all those are because i'm
just going to show you
so let's start pulling some fields in
here and creating a visualization and
then i'm going to show you how all of
that works including filters as well so
the first thing that we're going to look
at is global sales and let's put that in
the rows
and then i'm going to take year and i'm
going to make that the column
and this is basically exactly what
i wanted to do now as of right now
it has only the year and it's looking at
global sales for everything but we want
to break that out a little bit better
i want to break it out by let's do genre
so different genre of games now
if i add that right here to these
columns it is going to break it up by
year
and genre
if i add it right here
is going to break it out by the year of
course but then in each individual row
has the different genre that's not what
we want we want to keep
this type of line graph
and what we're going to do is we're
going to add it to marks
and you can't really see it based off of
these colors but they're all different
so we have action genre we have the
sports genre racing role playing all
these different genres within it now we
can get rid of that because we don't
need it anymore
and this is where
these
these marks really come in handy because
you can start
basically doing what you want with them
so for the genre i want to be able to
see all these different genres with
different colors to me that just makes
the most sense so i'm going to put color
right here
and automatically it assigns every
single genre its own color and gives us
this legend right over here
and so it's really easy to
see well when you have smaller numbers
is much easier but i know that red is
sports and i can go right here and find
red and that is sports
so it makes it a lot easier than when it
is all the same color blue
so what you can do after that is you can
also add things like a label to it so if
we take label and we or we take genre
put label
you can click right here and you can get
rid of the labels that you have and you
can see them right down here or you can
also change
the font so if you want to make it
orange or whatever color you can do all
the same things
and you can also do things like changing
where you see these things
so for action you're going to see it a
ton because for each year action is is
at the
is on the higher end and so you're
seeing those in those mins and maxes
you can also do it for a selected area
so if i come in here and i select it
it's then going to show me what those
are so label is really really uh useful
really helpful
let me get rid of that really quick
uh you can also do it where the lines
end so line ends is at the beginning and
the end and you can also take that away
or put that back on so labels are really
important labels aren't very helpful
when you're doing at least i don't find
that it's super helpful when you're
doing things like genre so when you're
doing your dimensions so i'm going to
get rid of that and i'm actually going
to bring
our global sales over here
and let's label that
and right now i think it's labeling the
line ends we want to do the min and max
now if we do min and max on the table
it's just gonna give us the max and the
min which is zero and then 139.4
it's a little bit more useful if we do
it
per each line uh this at least gives us
some context i probably wouldn't do this
in an actual visual visualization but to
give you some understanding of how just
how it works so now i know that um right
over here the min and the max or the min
sorry the max for these for action
and for sports is right around 138 139
so it's pretty easy to see
and you can
again go in here and you can remove the
max or remove the mins whichever one you
feel is best
you'll probably keep the maximums in
there for each category and so this is a
really quickly becoming a pretty usable
visualization and it's not the only
label that you can add we still are
using year over here so we can always
drop year and there as well we'll create
a label and so now we have let's see for
this one is a puzzle genre
so we also have the year that it had the
maximum
sales and so you know just some things
that you can do you don't have to add
that
now let's go up here and we're going to
take a look at filters because filters
are really important you know if you are
making this for a client or you're
making this for somebody you want them
to be able to filter down
to very specific information that they
want to see so let's take uh the
platform lots of different platforms
um as you can see you know ps4 xbox
if you're familiar with these we'll
click all of these
and we'll click ok
so now this is an option as a filter and
all we're going to do is we're going to
click on this arrow right here and we're
going to say show filter
now right now all of them are selected
so every single one is being taken into
account for this visualization
but let's say we come down here and we
say okay i don't want to see sales for
any of these ps the original playstation
two three or four so i'm gonna get rid
of this one this one
this one
and this one and you could immediately
see the the changes that were happening
so now none of the numbers none of those
sales are being accounted for and and
being added to the sum of global sales
right here at all
so
that is just how a filter
can work and
you can also
do that
and you can get rid of all of them and
you can go in and actually just pick
very specific sales so if you only want
to see the playstation sales you can go
in there and do that as well so really
really handy filters are things that you
at least want to have as an option for
most of your your visualizations at
least that's what i found especially
when you're doing client-facing work
they like to
get in there and mess around and look at
different look at it in different ways
and so that's one that i i think is is
really useful to to have
the very last thing that we want to do
is we want to actually add this to a
dashboard now
let's say we come right down here and we
add a new worksheet
and actually we might change one more
thing on that last one but we'll just
make a really simple one
we'll just give it genre and we'll give
it global sales as the rose
and this nifty button right up here
which is a sorting button so i'm going
to sort like that
i'm going to add the genre in just as we
did i'll give it different colors
perfect
now we have two really quick different
visualizations right
what i want to do is just show you how
to combine those because what you are
going to do
is you're going to actually come in here
and you're going to do new dashboard
that's what this button is right here
now when we come in here the size is
extremely small it's very easy to fix
that all we're going to do is click
right here
we're going to go to this range or this
drop down and we're going to click
automatic
so now it is a much larger size for us
to actually drop our visualizations into
uh and let's put sheet one
and we'll put let's put it up top
so now it looks a little bit like this
not perfect but again
if i wanted to make this look a lot
better i definitely would
and then you can go over here and you
can rename these things you can also do
that back when we were in our actual uh
worksheets but you can also do it here
as well and then start um you know
customizing and building it out that's
not what this video is for that is the
last video we're going to build an
entire dashboard it'll be kind of like a
small project you can put that in your
portfolio
if you have gotten this far and you want
to jump straight into it and you don't
want to wait for these other videos to
come out or you don't you just want to
jump straight into creating an entire
portfolio project i have an entire
portfolio project series that covers sql
python and tableau and so go check out
that series i have one video dedicated
to tableau it's like 45 minutes or an
hour long
and it covers a lot of the things that
we're going to hear in here as well as a
few other things
but i appreciate you checking out this
video in future videos we'll be going
over things like creating bins
calculated fields doing joins and then
creating a final project and putting it
all together so thank you so much for
joining me i really appreciate it if you
like this video be sure to like and
subscribe below and i will see you in
the next video
