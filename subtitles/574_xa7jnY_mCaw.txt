hi i'm victor in this video we are going
to explore the concept of ubiquitous
computing
let's first define the term ubiquitous
computing
is a concept of software engineering and
computer science
where computing is made to appear
anytime and everywhere
ubiquitous computing can occur using any
device
in any location and in any format it is
the use of computers in
everyday life this is also known as
pervasive computing
the terms ubiquitous and pervasive both
mean
existing everywhere this is a post
desktop model of human computer
interaction
in which information processing has been
thoroughly integrated
into everyday objects and activities
this is the idea that almost any device
from clothing to tools
to appliances to cars to homes
can be embedded with chips to connect
the device to an infinite network of
devices
it supports one user to many computing
tasks
and in one device with multiple
computing tasks
like a smartphone
the father of ubiquitous computing is
mark weisser
who was the chief scientist at xerox
park
palo alto research center in the u.s he
coined the term ubiquitous computing
around 1988
he articulated the idea of ubiquitous
computing
he stated that the highest ideal of
ubiquitous computing is to make
computers so embedded
so fitting so natural another known
personality in this concept
is manual castles he suggested in his
book
the rise of the network society that
there is an ongoing shift from already
decentralized
standalone microcomputers and mainframes
towards entirely pervasive computing
in its model of a pervasive computing
system castos
used the example of the internet as the
start of a pervasive computing system
he imagined a system where billions of
miniature
ubiquitous interconnected devices will
be spread
the goal of ubiquitous computing is to
create an environment where the
connectivity of devices are embedded
in such a way that connectivity is
unobtrusive and always available
such devices characteristics may be very
tiny
small inexpensive and robust network
processing
it is either mobile or embedded in
almost any type of objects
such as cars tools appliances
clothing and various consumer goods all
communicating through
increasingly interconnected networks
here are some examples of ubiquitous
computing
computer sensors in your floor that can
monitor your physical health
computer in your car that can assist you
when you drive to work
replacement of old electric meter with
smart meter
smart meters are tools used to manage
and record electricity
and performance of electronic devices in
the home
one of the advantages of smart meter is
it eliminates manual monthly meter
readings
automatic intelligent lighting system
and cooling system
the ubiquitous computing environment
might interconnect
lighting and environmental controls with
personal biometric monitors
woven into clothing so that illumination
and heating conditions
in a room might be modulated
continuously
and gradually this is a smart thermostat
it can be controlled with a phone tablet
smart speaker or other internet
connected device
smart thermostats typically allow you to
schedule your desired temperature
settings
and you can also incorporate them into
home automation systems
refrigerators that are aware of their
suitably tagged contents
and are able to plan a variety of menus
an interactive whiteboard it is a large
interactive display as a whiteboard for
education or business presentations
it can either be a standalone
touchscreen computer used independently
to perform tasks and operations
or a connectable apparatus used as a
touch
pad to control computers from a
projector
use of rfid tags with both barcodes and
qr codes
it allows the consumer to connect to the
internet of things
with a simple scan of a smartphone or
tablet
making objects marked with a qr code or
barcode
would mean improving the retail
environment for consumers
because they will be more educated about
the item before purchasing and they will
be able to check for an item's
availability
let's compare virtual reality and
ubiquitous computing
virtual reality puts people inside a
computer-generated three-dimensional
environment
on the other hand ubiquitous computing
focuses the computer to live out here
in the world with people
here are some challenges of ubiquitous
computing
privacy and security in a fully
networked world with ubiquitous sensor
equipped
devices several privacy and security
issues may arise
the people in this environment will be
worried about their privacy
since there is the potential of total
monitoring ubiquitous computing has a
social impact on our society
for example how will an individual know
if they are within a smart environment
where embedded devices are gathering
data
is it ethical to gather information from
individuals without their knowledge
next is volatility not only does the
world change
but also the set of users devices and
software components in an environment
they change over time with this the
trending device might be replaced fast
by the technologies
that are to be released in the coming
days support for the current technology
may then be stopped
this results in incurring more expenses
to individuals and businesses
impromptu interoperability this means
many technology producing companies
produce their own products
speaking their own proprietary language
this leads to non-interoperability
between devices
from different companies this results to
lack of systems
administrations or regulations
here are some advantages brought to us
by ubiquitous computing
it processes information effectively and
enhances effortless user experience
it allows us to manage information
efficiently
it removes complexity of new technology
since they are designed to be used on a
day-to-day basis
it is designed to be integrated for
man's use
seamlessly or invisibly
it allows socialization and faster
guided decision
making here are some uses of ubiquitous
computing
information access text or multimedia
document retrieval
like when we are using an electronic
book
those uses can be performed through the
help of the following hardware and
software technologies
like automatic indexing automated
indexing is the process of assigning and
arranging index terms without human
intervention
the index is produced using algorithms
rule sets or machine learning
next is networking speech recognition
wireless protocols and user sensitive
devices
to end our discussion about ubiquitous
computing let's discuss
its key elements which are ubiquitous
sensing
access middleware and networking
ubiquitous sensing uses a sensor it is a
device that responds to a physical
stimulus
such as heat light sound pressure
magnetism or a particular motion and
transmits a resulting impulse
as for measurement or operating a
control this gives
systems eyes and ears and adding more
awareness to ubiquitous computing
ubiquitous access represents the ability
for a cloud service
to be widely accessible by devices
transport protocols
interfaces and security technologies
example is when mobile computers
or wearable computers access information
next is ubiquitous middleware it is
typically a software
it shields an application from low level
details that is interacting with
ubiquitous networking
sensing and access the last key element
is ubiquitous networking it is the
distribution of communications
infrastructure and wireless technologies
throughout the environment to enable
continuous connectivity
here is an example where all these
elements are identified
the floor detects user movements through
its sensors
which sends signals and are accepted by
a device with
application software the device sends
data to the cloud
and useful or relevant information
needed may be returned
the information will then be shown to
the screen and effect devices
this next example is from the article
entitled google's
smart bathroom patent put sensors in
your toilet
tub and mirror by christian the looper
on
august 10 2016 at www.digitaltrends.com
the patent describes sensors in a bath
mat that measures heart rate
through the body's electrical patterns
it has a camera in the bathroom mirror
which would be able to detect things
like skin color variations
it has sensors in the bathtub creating
an ultrasonic bathtub that could perform
an echo test
additional sensors may also be installed
to detect blood pressure
and to help keep track of the nervous
endocrine
and muscular systems all those data
could be collected
and sent to health professionals with
users consent
according to google those collected data
could provide
much more valuable data as it's
collected daily
rather than once every few months the
patent was filed by jeffrey rogers
who was director of engineering at
google when the patent was filed
here are the references
