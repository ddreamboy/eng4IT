hi guys this is akil and today i would
be covering up the concept of cloud
computing architecture
but before that i would request you guys
to subscribe our video channel along
with that you can like our video
you can find the details uh just below
our video now let's look into what we
have for today's session
so today we will be covering up why we
require cloud computing
uh what is cloud computing technology
uh what are the benefits of cloud
computing
and uh the two main architecture pillars
of cloud computing
along with that other components of the
cloud computing technology
now why do we require cloud computing
let's look into it
so earlier what was happening
before the cloud computing technology
the organizations were facing some
challenges challenges in terms of
on-prem infrastructure
so on-prem infrastructure on-prem setup
is expensive
it is less scalable
because you have already procured the
infrastructure so the scalability
becomes lower
along with that they require a lot of
huge space for the servers
if in case you have lost data in the
on-prem it becomes
difficult to recover them
along with that it takes long deployment
times
apart from that the other challenges
were the lack of flexibility
poor data security
less collaboration with the inter
infrastructure
and the data cannot be accessed remotely
though data can be accessed remotely but
there were some challenges in terms of
the security
now all these challenges
were basically overcome when the cloud
computing technology was introduced
so before cloud computing managing files
on a local storage was also difficult
but
with the introduction of cloud computing
what we got we saw that
there is no server space required so
nothing needs to be set up in the
on-prem infrastructure no experts
required for hardware and software
maintenance because that would be done
by the cloud computing vendor itself it
gave a better data security
and the disaster recovery setup is
fantastic in terms of the cloud
computing technology
along with that
ease of deployment the deployment
activities become
are easier in terms of setting up on the
cloud computing platforms it is cost
effective you pay as you go there are on
demand services
management of services easy
as well as the collaboration is also
efficient so
cloud computing is generally better than
the on-prem infrastructure because of so
many advantages it has
now
we have seen the advantages of the cloud
computing why the organizations opt for
the cloud computing but what is actually
the cloud computing technology is
so cloud computing is basically the
delivery of on-demand resources so
anything which you need that is
available
so
such as server database software
and they are accessible over the
internet so here in the diagram you can
see
that a computer or desktop can access
any
service over the internet so it's
basically related to server database and
the softwares
it also gives the ability to build
design and manage applications on the
cloud platform
now you just have to note that companies
offering these computing services are
called as the cloud providers so like
aws google cloud these are all the cloud
providers
the cloud computing service providers
are called as the vendors
they provide services to manage the
applications through a global
infrastructure or a global network
some of the examples as i mentioned aws
microsoft azure as well as google cloud
so these are the three primary cloud
providers in the market
let's look into what are the benefits of
using the cloud computing
it is easily upgraded
sometimes the upgrades are managed by
the vendor itself so there are no
hassles in terms of doing the upgrades
it is cost efficient since these are on
demand services so you pay as you use or
you pay as you go
the scalability
is almost you can say unlimited depends
on the setup or the infrastructure of a
cloud vendor and you can scale as much
as you require
and
it provides you a lot of services where
you can do the automation so you can
basically create your applications
and you can automate them
you can even deploy your application
using the automation it is highly
available the reason is that they have a
redundant infrastructure so you can
create or deploy your applications which
will be highly available
flexible so you can shift between the
services you can shift between the
infrastructure whenever you need
along with that it gives you the better
security in terms of managing your
applications along with the databases
and you can do the customization as per
your requirement
now let's understand
what do we mean by the cloud computing
architecture
so this diagram represents the cloud
computing architecture where you can see
there is a cloud infrastructure which we
call as a front end front end means the
infrastructure that is network facing
that is internet facing and the back end
is where actually the application the
services
and the devices are
like storage servers and all
along with the management and the
security portals
so primarily the cloud computing
architecture has two components one is
the front end and the other one is the
back end
now with respect to the architecture the
cloud computing is architecture as we
discussed earlier is divided into two
parts front end and the back end it
provides applications and interfaces
that are required for the cloud-based
services
so front-end would be anything which is
facing the internet for example
the websites that you deploy they are
front-end because they are accessed by
the
public over the public network
these applications basically such as web
browser google chrome and internet
explorer over which you can basically
open up your web applications your
websites and also it includes client and
mobile devices along with some apis
so this is with respect to the front end
architecture
now
let's look into the
further more concepts related to the
front end so in the front end the cloud
infrastructure
consists of a hardware and the software
components that includes a data storage
server virtualization software etc
also it provides the gui
we call it as a graphical user interface
to the end users so that they can
perform the respective task so it's a
gui based access and those who are not
from the coding background or they don't
have familiarity with the cli it is an
advantage
now let's understand the back end
architecture
so the back end is basically it manages
all the programs that runs
the application on the front end
so whatever is required to support the
applications for example web
applications which are running on a
front end
would be available in the back end
it has the larger number of data storage
systems and server so it is basically it
comprises of the entire infrastructure
of a cloud provider
and it can also be a software or it can
be a platform as well
so based on the requirement the
application provides output to the end
users in the back end
also it is one of the most important
components in the cloud because it is
you can say a backbone of a cloud
computing architecture
and its task is to provide utility in
the architecture
and the few services that are widely
used among the end users are storage
application development environments and
the web services
in the back end with respect to the
storage it maintains and manages any
time of any amount of data over the
internet
some of the examples of storage services
on the cloud are s3 which is called as a
simple storage service
oracle cloud storage and microsoft azure
storage
the storage capacity varies depending
upon the service providers available in
the market
and also it allocates specific resources
to a specific task it handles functions
of cloud environment so this is with
respect to the management in the backend
architecture
the management in the backend
architecture helps in the management of
components like applications task
service security
data storage and the cloud
infrastructure
and in simple terms it establishes
coordination among the resources
coming to the security aspect of a back
end architecture
it is an integral part of a crowd
infrastructure because
since you it mostly relies on the
storage and the databases so it has to
be more secure it helps in protecting
cloud resources system files and the
infrastructures
also it provides security to the cloud
servers with virtual firewalls and
results in the prevention data loss
now the different components of the
cloud computing architecture one is the
hypervisor
second is the management software
the third one is the deployment software
fourth one is the network
fifth one is the cloud server
and you have the cloud storage
now let's look into what we have with
the hypervisor
hypervisor as the name suggests is a
virtual operating platform and that is
basically used by every user
it runs a separate virtual machine on
the back end which consists of a
software and the hardware
also it maintain objective its main
objective is to divide and allocate
resources so basically the hypervisor is
primarily used to
virtualize the physical machines so that
it can be shared across with many
resources or many users
the management software its
responsibility is to manage and monitor
the cloud operations so all the
operational tasks are basically done by
the management software
it helps in improving the performance of
the cloud since
you can do the admin task as well for
example high security flexibility
full-time access and the access given to
other
users who would be working on the cloud
platform
the deployment software consists of all
the mandatory installations and
configurations that are required to run
a cloud service
every deployment of cloud service is
performed using a deployment software so
it is primarily used for deploying the
applications or a software
so that basically saves the time of a
in terms of deploying their codes
now the three different models which can
be deployed are
the software as a service which we call
as a sas so the software as a service
means it hosts the software and manage
the application of the end user example
is gmail so gmail is an example of a sas
service where
it tax has a mailing service
and the users just have to create their
email accounts and start using the
service the pass is basically a platform
as a service and it helps
to develop and build and deploy the
applications on the software primarily
used by the coders they can concentrate
more on their development activities
and less
focus on the infrastructure part
example is microsoft azure and the
infrastructure as a service is is
basically to provide services on pay as
you go pricing
model
coming to the component of a cloud
computing architecture that is network
so
what is with respect to network why do
we need a network so it connects the
front end and the back end together so
the network can be the internal private
network of a cloud computing provider as
well as the public network and also it
allows every user to access the cloud
resources
over the internet
it helps users to connect and customize
the route and protocol so
let's say an admin wants
a particular ips to be blocked so you
can specify them and customize them in
the route and the protocols
it is a virtual server which is hosted
on the cloud computing architecture so
it is just like a virtual
networking that is available on the
cloud computing platform
it is highly flexible secure and cost
effective and it is
basically you can say the backbone in
terms of connecting multiple services
together
the cloud storage is basically where
every data is stored and that can be
accessed by a user from anywhere over
the internet
of course it depends on how do you
provide the access to it
it is scalable at runtime and it is
automatically accessed
and the data can be modified and
retrieved from the cloud storage over
the internet itself
