I'm the reason that cryptocurrencies are
called
cryptocurrencies is because they're
secured by cryptography and one example
of this which a lot of the major
cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin use is
blockchain now people often get confused
by this blockchain is not Bitcoin
blockchain is not a currency itself
