data is the most
valuable asset which is the reason why
data security has become an
international agenda
data breaches and security failures can
put the world economy at risk
realizing the need for the national and
economic security
the president of the united states
issued an executive order to develop a
cyber security framework
to help reduce cyber risks hi folks my
name is arya and here i am
with another interesting video on cyber
security
so first let's have a look at the agenda
of today's session all right
to begin with we'll see how the us
government recognize the need for
reliable function
to secure the national and economic
infrastructure to improve critical
infrastructure security
next we will discuss the importance of
cyber security frameworks
and why it is required in an
organization then i'll be telling you
about
different types of frameworks moving on
i'll tell you about the components of
cybersecurity frameworks that make it up
all
and after discussing the framework i'll
tell you what steps are required to
implement frameworks in an organization
finally i'll describe a common flow of
information
and decisions at the different levels
within an organization
okay so let's begin so recognizing the
national
and economic security of the united
states depends on the reliable function
of critical infrastructure
the president issued executive order
13636
which is improving critical
infrastructure cyber security
in february 2013. the order directed
nist to work with stakeholders to
develop a voluntary framework
based on existing standards guidelines
and practices
for reducing cyber risks to critical
infrastructures
the cyber security enhancement act of
2014
reinforced nist's executive order 13636
role created through collaboration
between industry and government
the voluntary framework consists of
standards guidelines and practices
to promote the protection of critical
infrastructure the prioritized flexible
repeatable and cost-effective
approach of the framework helps owners
and operators of critical infrastructure
to manage cyber security related risks
now according to section 7 of executive
order
the secretary of commerce shall direct
the director
of the national institute of standards
and technology
could lead the development of a
framework to reduce cyber risks
to critical infrastructure the cyber
security framework shall include a set
of standards
methodologies procedures and processes
that align policy business and
technological approaches
to address cyber risks the cyber
security framework
shall incorporate voluntary consensus
standards and industry best practices
to the fullest extent possible now let's
see why exactly do we need a cyber
security framework
let's tackle that question so the
framework will help an organization
better understand
manage and reduce its cyber security
risks
it will assist in determining which
activities are most important to assure
critical operations and service delivery
in turn that will help prioritize
investments and maximize the impact of
each dollar spent on cyber security
it results in a shift from compliance to
action and specifies outcomes
by providing a common language to
address cybersecurity risk management
it is especially helpful in
communicating inside and outside the
organization
that includes improving communications
awareness and among it
planning and operating units as well as
senior executives of organizations
it gives you a measure of where you are
and where you need to go
it can be implemented in stages or
degrees which make it more appealing to
business
it has built-in maturity models and gap
analysis so you don't need additional
maturity models
on top of csf organizations also can
readily use
the framework to communicate current or
desired cybersecurity postures between a
buyer or supplier
now let's see what exactly is a cyber
security framework
the framework is voluntary guidance
based on existing standards
guidelines and practices for
organizations to better manage and
reduce cybersecurity risks
in addition to helping organizations
manage and reduce risks
it was designed to foster risk and cyber
security management communications
amongst both internal and external
organizational stakeholders
now let's see the types of cyber
security frameworks that we have
so the first type of framework is pci
dss
which stands for payment card industry
and data security standards
it is a set of security control required
to implement
protected payment account security it is
designed to protect credit cards debit
cards and cash card
transactions the second type of
framework that we have
is iso 2701 and 2702
it is the international organization for
standardization
now the best practices recommendations
for information security management
and information security program
elements are from this framework
the third type of framework is cis which
stands for critical security controls
a prescribed arrangement of activities
for cyber protection that gives
particular and noteworthy approaches to
stop the present most inescapable and
perilous attacks
a key advantage of the controls is that
they organize
and center fewer activities with high
outcomes
last but not the least we have the nist
framework nist framework is made for
improvising
critical infrastructure cyber security
with the goal to improve
organizations readiness for managing
cyber security risk
by leveraging standard methodologies and
processes
now out of all the frameworks we just
discussed nist is the most popular
framework
mist was developed in the february of
2013 after the us presidential executive
order
it was designed to address national and
economic challenges
and it is supposed to be voluntary at
least for private sectors
now let's discuss the objectives of the
framework so the cyber security
frameworks prioritized
flexible and cost-effective approach
helps to promote the protection and
resilience of critical infrastructure
and other sectors important to the
economy and national security
the framework was developed to be
adaptable flexible and scalable
by an organization also it should
improve
organizations readiness for managing
cybersecurity risks
the framework was designed to be
flexible and performance based
and it should be cost effective it
should leverage standard and
methodologies and processes
and should promote technological
advancement and innovation
and it should be actionable across the
enterprise focus on outcomes
now let's discuss the components of the
nist cyber security framework
the cyber security framework consists of
three main components
namely the core implementation tires and
profiles
the framework core provides a set of
desired cyber security activities
and outcomes using common language that
is easy to understand
the core guides organizations in
managing and reducing their cyber
security risks
in a way that is complementing an
organization's existing cybersecurity
and risk management processes next we
have the framework implementation tiers
which assists an organization by
providing context on how an organization
views cyber security risk management
the tiers guide organization to consider
the appropriate level of rigor
for the cyber security program and are
often used as a communication tool
to discuss the risk appetite mission
priority and budget
last but not least is the framework
profiles which are an organization's
unique alignment
of their organizational requirements and
objectives
risk appetite and resources against the
desired outcomes of the framework core
profiles are primarily used to identify
and prioritize opportunities
for improving cyber security at an
organization
let's discuss the framework tires now
the tires describe the degree to which
an organization's cyber security risk
management practices
exhibit the characteristics defined in
the framework
the tires range from partial which is
time 1 to adaptive which is type 4 and
describe an
increasing degree of rigor and how well
integrated cybersecurity risk decisions
are into broader risk decisions and the
degree to which an organization shares
and receives cybersecurity information
from external parties
tires do not necessarily represent
maturity levels organizations should
determine the desired tire
ensuring that the selected level meets
organizational goals
reduces cyber security risks to the
level acceptable by the organization
and is feasible to implement fiscally
and otherwise
next we have the core the core is a set
of desired cyber security activities and
outcomes organized into categories
and aligned into informative references
the framework core is designed to be
intuitive
and to act as a translation layer to
enable communication between
multi-disciplinary teams
by using simplistic and non-technical
language the core consists of three
parts
functions categories and sub-categories
the core includes five
high-level functions which is identify
protect
detect respond and recover these five
functions are not only applicable to
cyber security risk management
but also to risk management at a whole
the core asks an organization to
identify what processes
and assets need to be protected now
after assessing that
you need to find what protection is
available then you need to find out what
techniques can identify the threats
and what techniques can contain the
impact of an incident
and finally the core defines what
techniques can restore the capabilities
of the organization before the attack
all right now let's dive deeper into the
functions to see what these functions
actually do
and what purpose they solve so the
functions are the highest level of
abstraction
included in the framework they act as
the backbone of the framework core
that all the other elements are
organized around so the first function
is identify
it helps develop an organizational
understanding to manage cybersecurity
risk
to systems people assets data and
capabilities
the activities in the identify functions
are foundational for effective use of
the framework
understanding the business context the
resources that support critical
functions
and related cyber security risks enable
an organization to focus
and prioritize its efforts consistent
with its risk management strategy
examples of outcome categories within
this function include asset management
business environment governance risk
management
and risk assessment now the next type is
the protect function
so to develop and implement appropriate
safeguards to ensure delivery of
critical services
the protect function supports the
ability to limit or contain the impact
of a potential cyber security event
example of outcome categories within
this function include
identify management and access control
awareness and training
data security information protection
processes and procedures
maintenance and protective technology
the next kind of function is the detect
function
so this is used to develop and implement
appropriate activities to identify
the occurrence of a cyber security event
the detect function enables timely
discovery of cyber security events
example of outcome categories within
this function includes
anomalies and events security continuous
monitoring
and detection processes now next we have
the response function
now to develop and implement appropriate
activities to take action regarding a
detected cyber security incident
the response function supports the
ability to contain the impact of a
potential cyber security incident
the outcomes category within this
function includes response planning
communications analysis mitigation and
improvements
last but not the least we have the
recover function now to develop
and implement appropriate activities to
maintain plans for resilience
and restore any capabilities or services
that were impaired due to a cyber
security incident
the recovery function supports timely
recovery to normal operations to reduce
the impact
from a cyber security incident examples
of outcome categories within this
function include
recovery planning improvement and
communications
these five functions were selected
because they represent the five primary
pillars for a successful
and holistic cyber security program they
aid organizations in easily expressing
their management of cyber security risk
at a high level and enabling risk
management decisions
okay now let's understand the last
component of the nist framework
nist recommends that the framework be
customized in a way
that maximizes business value and that
customization is referred to as a
profile
profiles are an organization's unique
alignment of their organizational
requirements
and objectives risk appetite and
resources against the desired outcomes
of the framework core profiles can be
used to identify opportunities
for improving cyber security posture by
comparing a current profile with the
target profile
profiles are about optimizing the cyber
security framework
to best serve the organization the
framework is voluntary
so there is no right or wrong way to do
it one way of approaching profiles is
for an
organization to map their cyber security
requirements mission objectives
and operating methodologies along with
the current practices
against the sub-categories of the
framework core to create a current state
profile
these requirements and objectives can be
compared against the current operating
state of the organization
to gain an understanding of the gaps
between the two
now the following steps illustrate how
an organization could use the framework
to create a new cyber security program
or improve on an existing program these
steps should be repeated
as necessary to continually improve
cyber security
so the first step is to prioritize and
scope the organization identifies its
business mission
objectives and high level organizational
priorities
with this information the organization
makes strategic decisions
regarding cyber security implementations
and determines the scope of systems and
assets that support the selected
business line or process
the framework can be adapted to support
the different business lines
or processes within an organization
which may have different business needs
and associated risk tolerance risk
tolerances may be reflected in a target
implementation tier
step two is to orient yourself now once
the scope of cyber security program has
been determined
for the business line or process the
organization identifies related systems
and assets regulatory requirements
and overall risk approach the
organization then consults
sources to identify threats and
vulnerabilities applicable to those
systems and assets
so step three is to create a current
profile the organization develops a
current profile by indicating which
category
and subcategory outcomes from the
framework core are currently being
achieved
if an outcome is partially achieved
noting this fact will help support
subsequent steps by providing baseline
information the fourth step is to
conduct a risk assessment
this assessment could be guided by
organizations overall risk management
process
or previous risk assessment activities
the organization analyzes the
operational environment
in order to discern the likelihood of a
cyber security event
and the impact that the event could have
on the organization
it is important that the organization
identify emerging risks
and use cyber threats information from
internal and external sources to gain a
better understanding
of the likelihood and impact of cyber
security events
so the fifth step is to create a target
profile the organization creates a
target profile that focuses on the
assessment of the framework categories
and subcategories describing the
organization's desired cyber security
outcomes
organizations may also develop their own
additional categories and subcategories
to account for unique organizational
risks
the organization may also consider
influences and requirements of external
stakeholders
such as sector entities customers and
business partners when creating a target
profile
the target profile should appropriately
reflect criteria within the target
implementation tier
the sixth step is to determine analyze
and prioritize gaps
the organization compares the current
profile and the target profile to
determine gaps
next it creates a prioritized action
plan to address gaps
reflecting mission drivers costs and
benefits and risks
to achieve outcomes in the target
profile the organization then determines
resources including funding
and workforce necessary to address the
gaps using profiles in this manner
encourages the organization to make
informed decisions about cyber security
activities
support risk management and enables the
organization to perform cost effective
targeted improvement
the last step is to implement action
plan the organization determines which
actions to take to address the gaps
if any identified in the previous step
and then adjust
its current cyber security practices to
achieve the target profile
for further guidance the framework
identifies examples
informative reference regarding the
categories and subcategories
but organizations should determine which
standards guidelines and practices
including those that are sector specific
work best for their needs
an organization repeats the steps as
needed to continuously assess and
improve its cyber security
for instance organizations may find that
more frequent repetition of orient step
improves the quality of risk assessment
furthermore
organizations may monitor progress
through iterative updates
to the current profile subsequently
comparing the current profile to the
target profile
organizations may also use this process
to align their cybersecurity program
with their desired framework
implementation tier now the framework
helps guide
key decision points about the risk
management activities through the
various levels of an organization
for supporting risk management now as
you can see in the picture
it describes a common flow of
information and decisions at the
following levels within an organization
the levels are executive business
process and implementations or
operations the executive level
communicates mission priorities
available resources and overall risk
tolerance to business process levels
the business or process level uses the
information as input into the risk
management process
and then collaborates with the
implementation or operation level to
communicate business needs
and create a profile the implementation
or operation level
the implementation or operations level
communicates the profile implementation
progress to the business level
the business level uses this information
to perform an impact assessment
next the business level management
reports the outcomes of that
impact assessment to the executive level
to inform the organization's overall
risk management process and to the
implementation operation levels for
awareness of business impact
okay guys that was it from me for the
topic
of cyber security frameworks we
discussed how nist has actually changed
the whole cyber security environment
since it was released in the february of
2013
i hope you all learned something
valuable that's it from me goodbye
you
