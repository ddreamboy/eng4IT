hello friends welcome to engineering
tutorial
so in the previous videos
we have discussed the basic introductory
concepts related to iot and the
design of the iot network
okay the various concepts basic concepts
related to
that so
the basic definition of iot which we
have already
covered in the
design aspects of the iot
network okay basically the
physical design it involves the
communication
protocols okay the in the physical
design
aspect which involves the
defining the things that are involved in
the iot network
and the communication protocols the
communication protocols
the which defines how the data exchange
or sharing of information or data
between the various devices that are
involved in the network that happens in
several layers
i've already discussed that in the
previous video okay the design of the
iot networks i would please recommend
you to watch that video
first the two videos which i posted you
please watch that and then
come to this so this uh
communication it happens in several
layers
okay at several levels
so that is what is the topic of today's
discussion okay the communication layers
okay the levels
so we all know the basic definition of
the iot let just
look at it in order to just be
refresh a certain things so basically
iot can be defined as a world of
interconnected
things where each and every thing
a simple electronic or electrical
apparatus appliance
machinery which is powered by electrical
means
it is connected to the internet okay
for sensing actuation monitoring
processing control or simply
to exchange or share data among the
various
devices okay and everything
here is automated which means
all of these things take place without
minimal
or no interference by the
human beings okay so the main objectives
of the iot which we have already
discussed in the previous video it
involves
connecting the various things that are
operated through
electrical means device appliances
machines whatever
to achieve exchange of data and
information to share data and
information among one another
for achieving these functions
sensing processing controlling actuation
monitoring and to provide various
value-based
services okay
the iot network design it involves two
aspects
the physical design and the logical
design
so the physical design of the iot
that involves two things
the things in iot which we have already
discussed what those
things are it is anything which is
operated through electrical means and
has a unique
identity defined by the ip address or
url link okay
and it has the ability to
sense remote sensing actuation
monitoring
control it should fit into one of these
things okay one of these objectives
either it can it has sensing properties
actuation properties monitoring
properties control
processing whatever it should fit into
one of the
things one of the objectives
the second aspect is the communication
protocols now the communication
protocols
in iot they define or they determine
how the data is shared
or exchanged between the various devices
and this
thing happens at several
layers at several levels now i have
already posted a video related to
open system interconnection model in the
computer networking and data
communication
subject that section so you can please
check out that video and i would
recommend you to watch all of those
videos
around i think 15
around videos are there you please check
out those videos because it is
it is very much related to this subject
okay a lot of terms that we will be
using here
the in these basic uh introductory parts
it has already been covered there those
concepts so you please watch
watch those videos first now this
layers or levels in which the
communication takes place between
the various devices in the iot network
they are
the link layer the network or internet
layer
the transport layer and the application
layer
generally there is a top two bottom or
bottom to top
approach that is used depending upon
in which direction the data is being
sent or which is the sending device
which is the receiving device
so generally the
iot layers are in this way link layer is
at the bottom
above the link layer is the network or
internet layer
above that is the transport layer and
finally at the top
is the application layer now each of
these
layers has a specific task a specific
function which which which which
facilitates the exchange of data between
the two devices that are involved or the
devices that are
involved in the communication process
first the link layer the functions of
the iot layer so first is the link layer
now the link layer is mainly concerned
with the
physical medium okay connecting medium
which is being used
it can either be wired or wireless
if it is wired it it depends on
upon what type of wire it is what type
of cable is used whether it is a twisted
pair cable
coaxial cable optical fiber and if it is
wireless
what wireless means is used okay
in the electromagnetic spectrum which
frequency range is used microwave radio
wave whatever
okay it it involves determining the
characteristic features
associated with the physically
connecting medium
that connects the two devices okay
now we'll be discussing about these
things in detail
just here to give you an overall idea i
have just
covered it in short so the various
examples of
the link layer protocols that are used
okay they are eight zero two
point three ethernet eight zero two
point one one which is the wi-fi
eight zero two point uh this is the y
max
2g 3g 4g communication protocols
so these are the examples of
the link layer protocols
okay so these are the protocols that are
used
for the uh
which is related to the physical
characteristics of the connecting medium
now here i would like to make a
correction it is eight zero two point
one six which is the my y max
by mistake i've written it one one okay
it is uh y max is eight zero eight zero
two point one six okay so
the next is the network or
internet layer now
this is the layer which is just above
the link layer
now the link layer is concerned with the
physical characteristics of the
connecting medium
now the internet layer or the network
layer
this is responsible for the
sending and receiving of the
ip datagrams now what is this ip it is
the
internet protocol datagrams
now basically it is used for addressing
purpose
okay to determine the identity
of the source and the destination device
okay you know to identify which device
is sending the data
and to which device the data is being
sent okay where to send the data
so that is done achieved through the
internet protocol
datagrams or the ip datagrams which is
handled
by the network or internet layer
okay so the main objectives is the
addressing
or identification of the communicating
devices
or the devices that are involved in this
exchange of data the sending and
receiving of the data
and the routing of the data packets
routing means to
to send the data from the source device
to the destination device it can be it
can take place
directly or indirectly through various
intermediary nodes
uh so the various protocols network
layer protocols that are used are
ipv4 ipv6 6lowpan so basically it is
internet protocol version 4 internet
protocol version 6.
so these are the short forms we'll be
discussing about these protocols in
detail
so now you just know that these are the
network layer protocols
then is the transport layer okay which
is the layer above the
network or internet layer now
this layer it ensures
that the data or the information which
is
sent from the sending device or the
source it reaches
the destination it makes sure of that
okay so that is what is referred to as
end to end message transfer
capability okay so it can either be
stateless
or stateful now in stateless what me
what i don't want into i don't want to
go into that because
i have not described it here so
basically stateless means that
once the data is sent from the source
whether it reaches the destination or
not it does the the protocol has no
[Music]
role to play in that but in stateful it
makes sure
that the data is which is being sent
from the source it reaches the
destination
only then after receiving the data
the next data packet will be allowed to
uh the next communication will be
allowed to take place so that is
to to explain it in simple way so
the transport layer it provides various
services such as error control
it means any damaged data which is
x which is received by the destination
it will request
for to resend those data packets
again segmentation to divide the large
bunch of data or large data information
bunch
into several smaller packets then
the rate in which the data is being sent
and received
okay and the overcrowding of the data
packets to control that so this is what
error control segmentation flow and
congestion control generally
are an example of transport layer
protocols
are transmission control protocol tcp
and universal datagram protocol udp okay
now finally is the layer at the top
which is the application layer
now the application layer it defines the
rules regulations and protocols
about how a particular layer
interacts or is interfaced with the
layers that are below it
okay how the various layers okay each of
these layers
they are interfaced with one another how
they communicate with
one another how the data flow will take
place that is governed by the
application layer so generally
it performs data encoding which means
converting a data
or any data audio video image
anything into certain bit streams okay
bit streams means a
series of binary bits zero
and one zeros and ones that is what is
called as
data encoding and process to process
communication
now process to process communication
i've already discussed in the
computer networking and data
communication section in detail so
process to process communication
generally refers to the
the program from which the data is
sent to another program in the
destination device so that is basically
what process to process
communication is so here network
security comes into play cryptography
comes into play in the data encoding and
decoding
uh concept so we will not go into
those things now so just you remember
that this is the
function of the application layer the
example of the application layer is
http protocol hypertext transfer
protocol which is used
for you can see hutp and whenever you
look at a particular url
or website you will find this then
websocket
data distribution service dds and many
other protocols are there these are just
to name a
few so here we have discussed
the various layers in which
the communication protocols
they function okay the link layer the
network or internet
layer the transport layer and the
application layer
now here we have just covered them in
short we'll be discussing about each of
these
things in detail so i hope you like this
