the term artificial intelligence
or ai can seem so futuristic and
mystifying
but what if i told you it's already part
of our daily lives
no matter where we are in life ai has
impacted our daily lives
from automated customer interactions
improved personalized shopping
experiences
and operational automation ai can be
implemented seamlessly to improve our
way of living
ai has proven to streamline businesses
client experience boosting productivity
and thus
increasing revenue whilst all this talk
about ai may seem new and exciting
it also raises a concern regarding its
ethics
if ai is not deployed properly it could
cause harm
damage reputation or contain legal risks
technology itself is neutral and it is
important for people and organizations
to understand
and be accountable to the risks involved
in ai application and implementation
the development of ai must be
human-centric
with fair outcomes ultimately aiming to
enhance
our quality of life it must also be
transparent and explainable
where the purpose of the ai program is
clearly stated
and easy for users to understand
thus professionals in ai ethics have
built a comprehensive authoritative book
called the body of knowledge or be ok
it aims to serve as a guide that defines
what is considered
ethical implementation in the field of
ai technology
ultimately ai as with any tool or entity
when used reliably and honestly can help
improve our lives
while building a dependable platform for
which we as a society can build our
future upon
that is why it is important that we
focus on understanding ai ethics
and implementing it in a principled
