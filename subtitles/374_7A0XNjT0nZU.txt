you can kind of see it on there but not
quick really really big swings so that's
good to see that means that sellers are
doing a fairly good job coming out of
the gate at the right price maybe they
have to do a you know a small change or
two it's not like it's taking months and
months and months to find that right top
dollar price usually when we're seeing
homes that are sitting right now has
nothing to do with the house it has to
do with the seller and their agent
overpricing the property if a house is
priced right it will move if a house is
priced wrong it will sit until that
prices reduced to reach the marketplace
you see a little small upward Trend
right now but overall takes about a
month to sell a home
