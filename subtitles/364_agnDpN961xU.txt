hello everyone
this is george from invensis learning
welcome to our youtube channel
i am sure you guys might have heard of
cyber security in today's session
we are going to have a brief tutorial
about cyber security for beginners
so without any further delay let's get
started
we will begin this session by discussing
a little about what is cyber security
next we will move further onto the
history of hacking and security then
talk about cia triad
along with an example post that we will
take a look at
why we need cyber security and then
elements of network security
moving on we will discuss the types of
cyber attacks
then case study then basic practices and
methods to avoid cyber attacks
we will then talk about job prospects
and market trends and cyber security and
the role of cyber security analysts
and finally we will end this session by
discussing the top 10 cyber security
certifications and training
i hope the agenda is clear to you guys
we will now begin the presentation and
understand what is cyber security
so what is cyber security cyber security
is the set of practices used to protect
computers
computer servers mobile devices various
electronic systems
communications and computer networks and
data from malicious attacks and threats
it is also known as information
technology security or electronic
information security
let us discuss an example of cyber
security this is about a cyber attack
conducted on the united nations website
on august 11 2007 the united nations
website was hacked by turkish hacker
m125
the united nations official website was
hacked and displayed a message
that protested the usa and israeli
policies in the middle east region
this message was seen in the section of
the site reserved to statements by
secretary general ban ki-moon
the message also appeared on other web
pages that usually display quotes and
speeches from the secretary-general
after the hacking the united nations
website showed the message
hacked by karem125m zerostat and zee
that a cyber protest hey israel and usa
don't kill children
and other people peace forever no war
this message was displayed continuously
on the website
the hacker group called themselves cyber
protest a three-member group of karem
125
m zero stead nz and pseudonames
generally used by hackers
they also hacked websites of harvard
university the united nations
environment program
and companies like toyota and nestle
hacking has been done even before the
advent of computers in the internet
where phones and communication lines
used to be tapped to gain information
let us now look into the history of
hacking and security the timeline of
hacking and security started in 1962
with the first troll attack
when mit or massachusetts institute of
technology
sets up passwords for computers for
sustaining time limits and student
privacy
a punch card was made by a student alan
share who tricked the computer into
printing off passwords
he then used them to log in as other
people after his time limit is completed
he even shared these passwords with his
friends also called as troll
which was the first of its kind they
also made fun of their teacher by
hacking into his account and leaving
different messages
in 1969 a ucla student tried to transmit
the word login
to another computer at the stanford
research institute over the arpanet
a precursor to today's internet after
the alphabets ino are sent
the system immediately crashes so
the first message ever sent on the
internet was low
however after one hour the full word
login was immediately sent after
recovering from the crash
in 1970 nokia and motorola were hacking
victims when kevin mitnick broke into
one of the world's most highly protected
networks
he did this using social engineering
methods
pretending to insiders so that they hand
over passwords and codes
and then use the codes to access
internal computer systems
he was one of the most wanted hackers of
the time
in 1972 a message said i'm the creeper
catch me if you can creeper the first
computer virus in history
was developed by bob thomas a programmer
at bbn technologies
after infecting a computer creeper will
display its message
and start printing a file and before the
printing would be finished
jump to the next computer across the
network disappearing from the first
reaper the first antivirus was developed
against creeper
rabbit virus arrived very shortly after
creeper in particular
in 1972 the main difference is that the
rabbit virus
reproduced itself on the affected
computer until it takes over the system
and causes it to crash
in 1979 midnight gained unauthorized
access to a computer network
his friend gave him the phone number for
the ark
ark is a computer system that digital
equipment corporation or deck used to
develop its operating system software
called rsts
e mitnick copied dex company software by
breaking into its computer network
this was called the ark cyber attack in
1986
hess dirk and peter carl hacked into the
lawrence berkeley national laboratory
systems
hesse also hacked into united states
europe and east asia
military and industrial computers and
sold the information to the soviet union
kgv
hesse is estimated to have hacked into
400 usa military computers with
information access to space
aircraft satellite and other
confidential information
in 1987 the first publicly documented
removal of a computer virus was
performed
by brent fix in the year 1987. an
anti-virus program to counter the polish
mks virus was released in 1987.
this gave birth to the first commercial
anti-virus in the world
in 1990 the english computer journal pc
today reported about the disk killer
virus
each issue of the magazine was
accompanied by a disk
the july issue was infected with a copy
of the disk killer
more than 50 000 copies were sold disk
killer was unable to spread because of a
bug in the infection routine
pc today launched a recall and tightened
virus protection measures for the future
in 1999 melissa virus a macro virus
was circulated as an email attachment
that when opened
disables a number of safeguards in the
microsoft word 97 or
word 2000 and if the user has the
microsoft outlook email program
causes the virus to be recirculated to
the first 50 people in each of the users
email address books
melissa virus had the potential to
disable corporate and any other mail
servers as the ripple of email
distribution becomes a much larger wave
melissa virus caused the microsoft
corporation to shut down the incoming
email
in 2000 there was a problem called the
y2k
problem or y2k bug where the dates
beyond december 31
1999 would be interpreted as ooo for
1900 instead of 2000.
for this programmers used a technique
called windowing which would take all
dates from 000 to 20s from the 2000s and
not from the 1900s
also in the year 2000 the first free
antivirus was released in the market
in 2012 an online battle emerged between
saudi arabia and israel
a saudi hacker called xerox omar posted
details of 400
000 saudi citizens credit cards on the
internet as a retaliation to this
israeli hackers broke into the websites
of two major era banks
in 2013 and 2014 there were two
different data breaches on the yahoo
servers
conducted by an unauthorized third party
it was believed that almost 3 billion
user accounts were affected during this
period
in 2017 there was a ransomware attack
called as the wannacry attack
we will discuss this in detail in the
coming sessions
in 2019 there was a ddos attack
conducted on the new zealand stock
exchange market
this caused the stock exchange market to
completely shut down for four days
after the systems crashed in 2020
450 active world health organization or
who staff
email addresses and passwords were
leaked online along with thousands
belonging to others working on the novel
coronavirus response
in the same year over five hundred
thousand zoom accounts were compromised
and sold on the dark web and hacker
forms for less than a penny each
and in some cases given away for free
these were shared
so that hackers can use them in zoom
bombing pranks and malicious activities
as we have seen till now these cyber
attacks and threats
come in all types and sizes and impact
various sectors
the growing cyber attacks cost the world
economy more than one trillion dollars
almost one percent of the global gdp
where a company or an individual's
credentials their bank account details
and other confidential information is at
risk
let us now discuss about the cia triad
also called as the confidentiality
integrity and availability triad the cia
triad short form for confidentiality
integrity and availability is a model
designed to provide various companies
and organizations guidelines to help
them create their security policies
cyber security involves protecting data
and information from unauthorized access
deletion or modification to provide
confidentiality
integrity and availability we will now
discuss these components and some of the
information security measures designed
to assure
each of the components safety the first
one is confidentiality
confidentiality involves preventing any
access of data to unauthorized
individuals
it ascertains the identity of authorized
personnel involved in sharing and
holding data secure
private and anonymous confidentiality
can be compromised by hackers who crack
poorly encrypted data
incorporate various types of cyber
attacks and disclose sensitive data
this is very important in the context of
information security
the second one is integrity integrity is
usually protecting the information from
being altered by unauthorized
individuals
it denotes that data and programs can be
changed by authorized personnel
integrity can be compromised especially
by cyber crimes when malware is embedded
into web pages or when a machine is
turned into a zombie computer
this helps the users to trust the system
they are putting to use
the third and last one is availability
availability is ensuring that authorized
personnel has access to the data or
information when needed any data is of
high value if the concerned individuals
have access to it at the required time
unavailability of information usually
occurs when security incidents such as
human error
programming errors ddos attacks or
hardware failures
let us now look into a real-time example
explaining cia triad
a bank atm that offers users access to
cash bank balances
and other information is the best
example of the cia triad
it covers all three principles of the
cia triad
it provides confidentiality by ensuring
a two-factor authentication
atm card and password before allowing
access to data
the atm and bank software incorporate
data integrity by ensuring that any
transfers or withdrawals made through
the atm are reflected in the accounting
for the user's bank account
the atm provides availability because it
is present in a public place and is
accessible even when the bank branch is
closed
let us now understand why we need cyber
security there are three main reasons
why we need cyber security
the first one is protection from cyber
attacks the second one is ensure privacy
of information
the third and last one is provide
guidelines for data security
let us now look into the elements of
network security there are four elements
of network security
the first one is network access control
the second one is firewall security
the third one is intrusion prevention
system the fourth one is security
information and event management
or short form for seam let us now look
into each element in detail
network access control allows the
network admin to understand and control
who can and cannot access the network
firewall security decides whether
specific traffic in the network has to
be blocked or allowed
this is one of the most important
elements to maintain protection
intrusion prevention system is a threat
prevention technology that examines
identifies and prevents unusual network
traffic from exploiting vulnerabilities
seam or security information and
event management combine security event
management and security information
management into one composite security
management system
now we will discuss about the different
types of cyber attacks
what are cyber attacks a cyber attack is
an offensive action taken by a hacker or
unauthorized individual or a group of
individuals
who target computer systems i t
infrastructure computer networks
mobile devices and other computer
devices by using different methods to
break into
steel damage or alter crucial data and
information
individuals or groups of individuals who
conduct these cyber attacks are called
hackers or cyber criminals
today almost 59 percent of the global
population are using the internet either
on mobile devices or computers and
laptops
there has been tremendous development
and growth in technology and these
constant advancements come with many
repercussions
hackers have started coming up with
different ways to gain unauthorized
access and conduct cyber attacks for
monetary and information thefts
let us look into the different types of
cyber attacks the first type of cyber
attack is called fishing
phishing is one of the most used types
of cyber attacks
the attackers by this method try to get
access to personal information like
login credentials
debit or credit card details by
pretending themselves as concerned
competent authorities
phishing is executed mainly through
emails messaging
and phone calls the next type of cyber
attack is called the ransomware
in a ransomware attack the user is
compelled to remove all of their data
and information from their system if
they fail to meet the timeline and
paying a ransom declared by cyber
criminals
in spite of all this there is no
guarantee as to whether paying the
ransom would secure their
data or not let us now look into a
recent 2017 ransomware attack called
wannacry
in the wannacry attack the hackers would
send a malicious email to make victims
click on an attachment or visit a
website
the ransomware uses the flaws in the
windows operating system to force it to
run the ransomware code in the system
the ransomware then encrypts or locks
all the important files in the system
and demands a ransom in bitcoin
cryptocurrency
the wannacry ransomware uses the
operating system flaw to replicate
itself
and spread around the computer network
the hackers however
made a mistake a kill switch was
discovered by another hacker
which helped in overcoming this attack
microsoft also released a patch update
both these measures help the users to
regain access to their documents
the next type of cyber attack is called
malware in a malware cyber attack
the hackers create a malware code to
hack any electronic or digital device
like mobiles
computers and laptops to obtain
unauthorized access
now we are now going to discuss the man
in the middle attack
a man in the middle cyber attack or mitm
attack occurs when the hacker places
himself in between the client and the
owner or between users and the server or
between
clients and server to misinform the
client and get unauthorized access to
data and information from the system
in this attack the hacker places himself
in the middle of the communication link
between the user or client and the
server
all data and information transfer of
both the user and the server goes
through the hacker
this gives the hacker unsolicited access
to complete information of the whole
digital system
and also the chance to misinform the
user or client this is how the hacker
gains complete control over the whole
system
the data transferred and the processes
involved in it
however all the time both the user and
server are unaware of the hacker
and for any outsider it seems that it is
a normal client server communication
system
we will now discuss the next type of
cyber attack called as the trojan horse
a trojan horse or a trojan is a malware
program designed by hackers to break
into electronic and digital devices by
disguising the program
the necessary software this type of
cyber attack is quite dangerous as it
helps the hackers to have unauthorized
access to crucial information of users
such as their credentials and financial
details the next type of cyber attack is
called as the sql injection
sql injection is the latest type of
cyber attacks being launched by hackers
this includes incorporating malicious
data into the user's digital device to
enable the hacker to give unauthorized
access to all the crucial and
confidential information belonging to
the user
we will now see and understand what dos
and ddos cyber attacks are
in a client server communication system
there are three level handshakes before
the data from the server is transferred
to the client system
the first handshake is client's request
to the server to load the webpage or any
result or any content
the second handshake is where the server
approves the client's request
gets ready to load and asks the client
device when to load
in the third handshake the first device
acknowledges and the server loads the
request
error 404 reflects when a web page
doesn't load
the website is down or there's a lot of
traffic on the website
it is detrimental to the profits of the
organization
this happens when the number of users on
the website on that page exceeds the
limit the website can handle
once it exceeds the page is down and the
users get this error
what happens if someone fakes the number
of users currently using the website and
the website gets down
intentionally this is precisely what the
dos and ddos attacks are
the dos attack stands for denial of
service attack
ddos stands for distributed denial of
service attack
in a dos attack the fake requests are
made by the same device to overwhelm the
website
causing it to crash in a ddos attack a
big network of devices creates a large
number of fake requests and together
requests the server at the same time
in a ddos attack big network devices
created by the hacker are called botnets
the botnets create a large number of
requests and together all request the
server at the same time
one botnet creates one or two requests
in both the attacks the hacker fakes the
number of users currently on the website
once this number exceeds the limit the
website cannot handle this anymore
and it crashes down this crashing is
done intentionally by the hacker so that
it affects the owners of the website
we will now see spear fishing and whale
fishing in a spear phishing attack a
hacker tries to gain
unauthorized access to confidential
information by conducting fraudulent
emails or phone calls
in a well-fishing attack a hacker tries
to access confidential and sensitive
information of powerful and famous
personalities like chairman
and head of organizations let us now
discuss drive-by cyber attacks
in a drive-by attack hackers embed
malicious scripts into various websites
whenever a user tries to visit the
website all the user data is accessible
to the hacker
because of these malicious scripts the
system gets corrupted
giving unauthorized access to data and
information to the hacker
the next type of cyber attack is called
the spyware hackers use cyber attacks
called spyware
which is unwanted software to infiltrate
into a victim's computer in order to
have access
to their sensitive information and
internet usage data
it is a type of malware that uses
malicious software to gain access and
damage a computer without the knowledge
of the user
there are again four types or categories
of spyware commonly called as
1 adware 2. keyboard loggers
3. trojans 4. mobile spyware
the next type of cyber attack is called
the adware the cyber tax where hackers
use various pop-up advertisements
to show up on a computer or mobile
device are called adware
short for advertising software the
adware can become dangerous by harming
your device
hacking into your browser slowing down
the device and install viruses or
spyware or both
the next type of cyber attack is called
the eavesdropping attacks
when hackers launch a cyber attack by
hacking into cell phones
computers and laptops by fabricating
information in those devices
it is called an eavesdropping attack
this attack is conducted to gain
unauthorized access to files by cyber
criminals
the next type of cyber attack is called
the password attacks
a password attack involves continuous
attempts by a hacker to obtain the login
credentials of a user
many hackers use different algorithms or
simply make calculated guesses to obtain
the password we will now look into a
case study of cybersecurity
jeep cherokee is a famous suv with
off-roading capabilities
there was a jeep cherokee cyber attack
in 2015 which turned out to be a turning
point for the automobile
industry charlie miller and chris
velasque two security researchers
remotely hacked the jeep cherokee
vehicle and took over control of its
functions
including the air conditioner radio
wipers brakes
steering wheel and accelerator due to a
loophole in the car's infotainment
system
this was the first time a remote cyber
attack was done on a vehicle
jeep cherokee was selected because of
its simple architecture
after this attack fiat chrysler recalled
more than one million hackable vehicles
for security patch updates
the hackers first targeted the
multimedia system by hacking the wi-fi
and compromising the automatic password
generation that occurs each time the car
starts
they use hacking techniques to break
into the system remotely
the main vulnerability they found out
was that the wi-fi password is created
before the actual date and time are set
and is based on a default system time
during which the infotainment system
starts they then took over the
infotainment system by exploiting the
software
by controlling the infotainment system
remotely various cyber attacks such as
changing the air conditioner settings or
increasing the fan speed
a sudden change in the volume of the
radio or turning off gps were launched
since the car infotainment system uses a
cellular connection to provide access to
the internet and other services they
exploited this vulnerability to deliver
the attack
let us now look into the solution that
was designed for this cyber attack
harman created a five-step plan to
counter future cyber attacks and avoid
any in the first place
the five steps are change organizational
structure
scrutinize third-party software proven
cyber security at the development stage
create risk analysis of threats
over-the-air software updates
we will now go through each of the five
steps organization structure
harman kardon the company whose
infotainment system was used as the
gateway to launch the attack
changed its organizational structure and
appointed cyber security professionals
to oversee issues at every stage
scrutiny the software at every stage of
the production process
create a checklist that involves
scanning third-party software for errors
and bugs
creating a risk analysis of potential
loopholes for every involved component
proven security if any new feature or
component is added to a vehicle
designers now first have to demonstrate
how they would secure the operation from
any potential cyber attack which might
happen at a future stage
risk analysis creating a risk analysis
at every stage of the development
process and undertake comprehensive
testing to ensure efficiency and avoid
any future risks in terms of cyber
security
over-the-air updates till now only
security patch updates were released for
any cyber tax
but since automobiles are used over a
longer period of time over the air
updates with the latest version for all
existing customers is a must
we will now discuss the most crucial
part of today's discussion
basic practices and methods to avoid
cyber attacks best practices and methods
to avoid cyber attacks include the steps
and methodologies involved to keep
oneself and any organization on the
whole
safe and secure both internally and from
any external threats
be it cyber attacks or any viruses or
computer worms
etc these practices and methods help in
a smooth and safe operating environment
and include keep your user data private
check your privacy settings update your
antivirus
use strong passwords scan emails before
opening check website url
log out as and when required respect
others
let us now look into each of these in
detail data privacy
always make sure that you keep your data
private so that it reduces the
chances of data leakage in the advent of
a cyber attack
strong password having a strong password
is of utmost importance
since hackers first target the user
credentials in order to gain
unauthorized access
privacy settings maintaining strong
privacy settings to all your work
be it on mobile devices or laptops or
computers
acts as the first line of defense
against hackers anti-virus
having a reliable and strong anti-virus
helps against any malicious software
viruses computer worms and other
programs developed in order to deliver a
cyber attack
scan emails it is highly recommended to
scan your emails before opening them
this helps in a way to avoid the chances
of various email hacking attacks usually
used by hackers
website url a website that starts with
https
is far more secure than the ones that
start with http
the additional protection provided
always counts in the advent of any cyber
attack
respect others having respect for others
privacy and confidentiality is crucial
especially that more and more people are
connected to the internet this is
important in every regard
log out every time you complete your
work and don't intend to use the system
log out of the system this is a
preemptive measure
as it avoids prying eyes from breaking
into your account we will now discuss
the job prospects and market trends in
cyber security
now we will discuss the cyber security
job prospects
the job prospects include cyber security
specialist
cyber security consultant incident
responder cyber security administrator
cyber security manager cyber security
auditor
i t forensic expert vulnerability
assessor
penetration tester cyber security
engineer let us now see the cyber
security market trends
after a global cyber security market
forecast was predicted by statista.com
it was observed that the global market
for cyber security is projected to grow
from 167
billion dollars in 2019 to 248.26
billion dollars by 2023
attaining a 10.4 cagr the expenditure on
worldwide security on identity access
management was at 10.58 billion dollars
in 2019
the forecast also predicted that
expenditure on security services
the largest chunk of the information
security market also reached 64.24
billion dollars in 2019 as well
let us now look into the role of cyber
security analyst and how to become a
cyber security analyst
cyber security analyst is one of the
most rewarding career options in the
field of cyber security
an analyst in general collects
translates and uses complex data to
design actionable steps to improve
processes and optimize results bringing
value to the organization
every day analysts assess company and
client needs
receive information and analyze it
looking for any trends or areas for
improvement
a security analyst ensures sensitive and
proprietary information of an
organization to be safe and secure
it is a vital role to detect and rectify
issues or defects in the applications
security systems and programs of an
organization it is the duty of the cyber
security analyst to suggest ways to
enhance the overall security and
communicate the specific measures to be
taken
cyber security analyst creates maintains
and controls the measures to make sure
computer networks are regulated and
monitored
how to become a cyber security analyst
the first step is to earn a bachelor's
degree in cyber security
i.t computer science or a related field
the second step is to complete an
internship to obtain experience or of
hands-on training in a computer-related
field
the third step is to gain special
credentials by obtaining certification
after training
the fourth step is to pursue for
entry-level positions and general i.t or
security in any organization
what are the cyber security analyst job
prospects
cyber security analysts have excellent
job opportunities and rewarding career
prospects
cyber security analysts enjoy high
salaries when compared with other
computer and i.t professionals
