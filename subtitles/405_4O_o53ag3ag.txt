so you're working with some data in
python and you want to make some
visualizations
well i've got news for you there's a lot
of data visualization packages out there
i mean
a lot
it can be a little overwhelming but no
need to worry i'm gonna step through
every single package known to man okay
just the main packages used for plotting
in python and by the end of this video
you should have idea of what each of
them do and how you can use them all
right let's start checking out packages
that doesn't sound right
and
here we are in our data vis kaggle
notebook
up first is the og of plotting in python
yeah you know it matplotlib
this package was initially released in
2003.
were you born in 2003
because it's so old a lot of other
things are built on it
and there's a ton you can do
first the imports
import matplotlib import pi plot as plt
this is just how you do it
let's say we want to plot a line plot
looks pretty nice
kind of boring but nice
wanna up the stakes why not your
standard scatter plot just a few lines
of code and we have colored dots ooh
run
border if you say rob i hate circles
i got the solution for you
matplotlib has tons of functionality you
can change the
points of the plot you could do a ton of
stuff but rob i want to do some
statistics
well built into matplotlib you can make
a histogram super easy look at these
aardvark lengths
oh wait no it's fake data
[Music]
but this is just the surface of what
matplotlib can do it's basically a pen
and paper for plotting
you can make almost anything check out
this awesome heat mat mesh grid
[Music]
not impressed with matplotlib
i created this function
that creates an entire football field if
you're not impressed i don't know what
will impress you
so to summarize
matplotlib one of the oldest libraries
in python customization out the wazoo
tons of other packages are built off of
it but the downsides are it's hard to
learn at first complex plots are going
to be code heavy and
even though it has the functionality
it's not really meant for interactive
plots
next up we have seaborne
little known fact did you know that
seabourn was named after the character
from west wing
samuel norman seabourn that's why we
import it as sns
seabourn is great if you want to make
some plots out of the box for
statistical analysis
stats major
and what's the distribution you're just
p hacking here we can use the seaborne
rel plot function to show the difference
between two groups in our data set
wow not as much code as in matplotlib
switch the style type to line and we
have a beautiful line plot are those
confidence intervals i see
one of the great things about seaborn is
you can look at the difference between
different categories in your data
without having to actually change the
data itself time saver check out this
swarm plot each stop represents an
observation in our group and it split
between different days of the week
nifty
and what about a violin plot
well a violin plot's a great way to see
the distribution compared between groups
and even split within a group
interested in just a normal old bar plot
we got you covered seabourn can make
those too
with confidence intervals
want to go beyond just a normal boring
scatter plot seaborn can do a joint plot
you can see distributions on the x and y
axis of each different grouping
and them colored in between
that's pretty cool and one of my
personal favorites is the pair plot have
a bunch of numeric features that you
want to compare
you have
kde plots on the diagonals scatter plots
everywhere else what more could you ask
for oh coloring by the different groups
it's got that too and it may not seem
like a big deal but in seabourn one of
the features i love is that you can use
the hue variable to add color to your
plots
so to summarize seaborne
standard plots for statistical analysis
easy to use out of the box it is built
on matplotlib so it's really just a
fancy matte plot lib there's much less
ability to customize
next up
[Music]
bouquet
or boca is it bokeh or boca tell me what
you think in the comments below i'm just
gonna call it bouquet when we import
bokeh
we can set it up to work in a notebook
just like that
super simple bouquet specializes in
interactive plots
your standard line plot here
but wait
i can select things i can move it around
this is amazing
one line not enough for you how about
multiple lines
very cool
okay let's pick it up a notch with
bouquet layouts we could put multiple
plots side by side
but it goes even deeper
we can plot two things at the same time
linked
look with this code if i select here it
also selects it on the other side
a lot of cool stuff you can do with
these linked plots with a little bit
more work you can make some pretty
amazing plots in this plot we've added a
bunch of circles
but the size of the circles and the
color are based on features in our data
but wait there's more
interactive plots are just the start
with bokeh you can actually interact
with the data live by adding things like
a range slider check out this code
a bunch of dots
but
we can filter based on this slider
want to change the
circle size on the fly
why not
the world's your oyster
and of course the standard bar plot is
always there if you need it
we create a figure and use the bar to
make something beautiful um
looking at this plot makes me hungry
once you become a pro with bouquet you
can write really long plots like this
that show unemployment numbers
throughout the years
i'm not gonna lie
this heat map is pretty beautiful
and you can even use bokeh to display
those awesome network x graphs that
you've been creating whoa when you hover
over a circle you can actually see what
it's linked to awesome
so to summarize
bouquet
interactive plots
almost infinite ways you can customize
bokeh plots
for me bokeh reminds me of the map plot
lib equivalent but for interactive plots
the downside though is it's like
matplotlib so it requires a lot of code
and the time has come
we're gonna talk about plotly express i
know you've been holding your breath so
just let it go now you can breathe i'm
really actually surprised plotly express
only has 657 github stars
go and give it a star
importing plotly express is as simple as
import as px plotley express like bokeh
allows you to create interactive plots
but the difference is
they're a lot easier to create using
plotly express scatter we can create a
scatter plot with just a few lines of
code
oh look at these petal widths
but i want a grid of plots you say well
look no further just provide a facet
column and facet row variable and you've
got yourself a grid of scatter plots
what about line plots we got you covered
uh check out australia and new zealand
oh australia is winning all this in just
one line of code
sign me up and it wouldn't be complete
without some bar plots just like bokeh
it's fully interactive so we can turn
things off if we don't like it
oh but i can't turn them both off
because i kind of don't want to see this
plot at all
remember seaborne's pair plot
well plotly express has the scatter plot
matrix
not a lot of code here
and we see the comparison
so this has the upside of being
interactive but i tend to prefer seaborn
for this type of plot
there are also a handful of custom plots
that are just gorgeous check out this
parallel coordinates plot
and one of my personal favorites
the parallel
categories plot
huh different groupings and how they
link oh you can hover over it
amazing
i'm sold i'm sold i'm sold
i'm sold i'm sold here's a perfect
example of using plotly express to make
a scatter plot
colors
sizes
all of them depending on the data
whoa
let's only look at oceania australia and
new zealand again
and for those of you who prefer pie
charts
the sunburst plot is
sort of like a pie chart kind of
just
don't make pie charts just like seabourn
again plotly express can do different
comparison between categories
check out these violin plots
not too much code here to create it too
and something you might not always use
but if you ever have a data set with
latitude and longitude
the scatter map box function can make
some beautiful maps
two dimensions not enough for you
well
we can go 3d with the scattered 3d plot
with plotly express
i feel like i'm in the matrix
so to summarize
plotly express two thumbs up for
interactive plots
it's kind of like seaborne but
interactive and those maps
i mean
i don't know what else to say if you're
not impressed by that map just close the
video right now just close it i don't
want you here also similar to seabourn
it's going to be hard to customize your
plots there is the plotly back end
and dash
but that's for another video
the next two libraries are slightly
lesser known
so let's talk about plot nine if you've
used r before you probably know gg plot
two it can make some gorgeous charts so
plot nine is basically gg plot and
python
the way you write the plots is different
than anything else that i've seen but
it's very similar to what you would do
in r so if you're familiar with r this
might be the package for you we got
scatter plots with regression lines
and standard error
can't be beat
one thing i gotta say is the default
colors in plot9 and ggplot are really
nice
with these few lines of code you can
make this bar plot with some lines
hey check out want to do some analysis
of greek letters
you can make a pretty bar plot
just a few lines of code
i like it
so to summarize plot nine basically gg
plot two positives the plots are pretty
the syntax is a little unique but if
you're used to r you might like it
downside is if you're not used to it it
takes a little bit of work to understand
and i gotta say the docks aren't that
great so if you're looking to do
anything custom
you might be up creek without a paddle
let's talk about alteir to be honest i
haven't used altair that much and i
don't really understand why it's
different but it is different
and
maybe if you understand it you can
explain it to me so the positives are
the positives are that it has
declarative visualization
and the negatives are that it has
declarative visualization
and last up we have pandas you didn't
think i would get through a video
without talking about pandas did you
that's right pandas can do plots
just take your data frame
use the plot method and you can make it
make a cool visualization like this in
milliseconds
but rob you say this is just matplotlib
i know but it saves you time because
it's already in pandas
show me a scatter plot there it is
pandas can even do box plots
these leave something
to be desired
area plots are actually pretty cool and
i use these a lot
it's basically a line plot
filled in underneath
so there you have it as quickly and
hopefully entertainingly as i could i
showed you every python package commonly
used for visualization if i missed one
please let me know in the comments below
we talked about matplotlib seaborn
bokeh
plotly express plot
altair
and pandas
everything you would ever ask for for
plotting with python
my name is rob i'm a data scientist and
kaggle grandmaster if you enjoyed this
video
please pretty please
subscribe
and like the video too
oh also you can find me on twitch where
i stream time to time okay that's it see
ya bye
