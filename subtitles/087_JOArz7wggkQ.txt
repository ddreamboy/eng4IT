looking to the past to predict the
future
[Music]
predictive modeling the core function in
predictive analytics applications
is a mathematical process that aims to
predict future events or outcomes
based on past behavior it does so by
analyzing data to identify patterns that
can be used to forecast what is likely
to happen in the future
the predictive modeling process begins
once a set of current or historical data
is collected for analysis
then data scientists or analysts create
algorithms in statistical models
train them with subsets of the data and
run them against the full data set to
generate the predictive model
in many cases multiple models are used
at once to create
one prediction while the terms
predictive modeling and predictive
analytics are sometimes used
interchangeably
modeling can be seen instead as the
hands-on part of analytics applications
which you can learn more about here or
in the description below
there are many different modeling
methods and algorithms some popular ones
include decision trees time series
analysis neural networks
linear regression and logistic
regression
predictive modeling is popularly
associated with meteorology and weather
forecasting
but has many business applications as
well online advertising and marketing is
one of the most common uses
analysts take user data like what you
click on what you buy
and how long you view something and run
it through algorithms to determine what
kind of products you're likely to click
on and purchase in the future
predictive modeling is also used in spam
filters fraud detection
crm capacity planning change management
disaster recovery engineering medical
diagnosis
and security management to name a few
while predictive modeling can aid in
business decision making
processes it must be used correctly some
considerations for effective predictive
modeling include
acquiring sorting cleansing and
preparing enough data for analysis
which is often said to take about 80
percent of the process
being careful not to over fit or over
test models
which can cause a model to just memorize
points in a data set
rather than generalized outcomes
planning for technical and
organizational barriers
like accessing useful data in
decentralized systems
and making sure predictive modeling
projects address real business
challenges
keeping in mind that statistical
significance does not always equal
business insight what other applications
are there for predictive modeling
