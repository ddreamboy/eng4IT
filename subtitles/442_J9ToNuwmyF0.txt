We must address our cyber security risk.
>> How is this going to
affect our bottom line?
>> We're going to need more personnel?
>> What's wrong with the way
we've been doing it?
Why is the additional expense necessary?
[MUSIC]
The cyber security framework,
in our mind, has been so successful,
because it has very large broad
appeal to many organizations,
small medium businesses,
large organizations.
It cuts across all different segments,
whether it's manufacturing, agriculture.
It's a framework that can be used across
many areas, many businesses, etcetera.
So therefore,
it's a very inclusive type of framework.

>> You gotta see this.
>> It provides companies
with a common language.
So, whether you're a CEO, or you just
walked into a company the first time
as a new employee, it's something
that you can feasibly grasp.
>> And this one offers the ease
of understanding simplicity
in a very complex topic.
>> It helps us communicate risk in ways
that everyone understands,
from the server room to the board room.

>> One of the areas that we found
ourselves both challenged and
stimulated by,
was building out the detect function.
This aligns well with kind of what's been
going on with the industry at large, which
is an evolution from kind of a protection
kind of mind set to one where there's
a recognition that organizations are going
to have successful cyber attacks.
And so it's not just about
defending the perimeter, but
ultimately detecting attack and
hoping to mitigate the consequences and
the duration,
can they get to the actual target?
[MUSIC]
>> Hello, I see that you
selected continuous monitoring.
Are you also interested in
response planning and analysis?
>> Not today.
We already have an existing
cybersecurity risk practice.
So we're only looking to add a few
new categories at this time.
>> Excellent.
The Framework is designed with exactly that type of fexibility
It allows you to choose what works
for your risk disposition and business.
Customize it to best suit your needs.
Have a nice day, sir.

>> Because of the cyber
security framework,
I'm proud to report that we
have minimized our risk and
have significantly reduced our
vulnerability to cyber threats.
