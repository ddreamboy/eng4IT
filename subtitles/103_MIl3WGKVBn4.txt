Neuro linguistic programming techniques,
what are they and what
can you do with them?
I'm going to show you some basic yet
powerful NLP techniques that I use so then
you can use them to so that you can
get more of what you want out of life.
Keep watching.
Hey there,
this is life mastery gym and I'm Damon
Cart and I teach people just like you
cutting edge processes and techniques
so that you can lead a more fulfilling
life and take charge of your destiny.
So if that sounds good,
please click subscribe to this youtube
channel so you can get these videos on a
regular basis.
I've been practicing and teaching neural
linguistic programming for years and
the techniques I'm going to show you
are just as powerful as when they were
created.
Full disclosure here though,
there is no way that I could
teach you and one youtube video.
All of the techniques and processes
that neuro linguistic programming has to
offer.
I have trainings that are hours and hours
long that teach these techniques and
these processes and full.
So what I'm going to give you here is
an overview that will help give you some
guidance on NLP techniques that you can
learn which ones are going to be more
appropriate for a certain areas or
certain problems that you're solving.
And then I will show you
at the end of this video.
A way that you can take this even deeper
with some free training that I offer.
Most people aren't aware that were NLP
techniques came from is they came from
modeling successful people
NLP itself is a model.
It's a model for modeling and
in the process of modeling
successful people comes
this abundance of techniques and processes
for solving problems for achieving
outcomes, achieving more success,
achieving more fulfillment in life.
If you already knew that NLP was first
and foremost about modeling type yes in
the comments below.
I'm just curious how many people actually
know that because when I talk about
NLP or when people ask me what NLP is,
they'd often don't realize that it is
about modeling and that the techniques
were sort of a byproduct of
those modeling processes.
I will link videos that go in more depth
with these techniques and processes.
So check the card and the one
of the corners of the screen.
If you click on it,
it'll open it up and you'll see that
there's other videos linked to this video
so that if you want to take a deeper,
you can see the other videos that
I've done on these processes.
The NLP techniques that I'm going to
cover in this video are the swish pattern,
eye movement patterns,
language patterns,
anchoring and values elicitation.
So let's start with the swish pattern.
What is the swish pattern is probably one
of the most well known in LP processes.
It's very simple, yet very,
very, and basically what it is,
if you're compelled to do something
like a habit or something that you don't
want to do and you want to break that
habit, you would use the swish pattern.
So let's say you're compelled to
eat food that's not good for you.
Like you,
you,
you start a diet or you want to
start exercising. You have this goal,
you have this idea of what it is that you,
how much weight you want to lose,
and despite planning this
out and thinking this out,
you end up not doing it.
You end up procrastinating.
You end up eating a bunch of
food that is not healthy for you.
You just end up watching TV or
something other than exercising.
So how would you break that compulsion,
the Swish pattern?
What it does is it gets inside that
experience of what it's like when you're
just sort of following a,
a program and unconscious program that
that guide you to do something that you
don't really don't want to do, which is
procrastinate and eat unhealthy food.
What normally happens is you're very
associated associated meaning when you
think about that, you're actually
in the memory, you're, you're,
you're in the experience itself rather
than seeing yourself in the experience.
So that's normally how we feel
compelled to do something.
And this is also the case
when we experience trauma
and people experienced post
traumatic stress disorder. It's because
when they think about the experience,
they snap into it as f as if they're
actually there. And so they feel, uh,
feel a compulsion to panic,
to feel fear,
to feel whatever it was
that they were experiencing.
The same thing happens with your habits.
So when you keep breaking your
plans or breaking the, the,
the goal or the, the, the activities
that you want to do to achieve that goal.
And instead you're, you're going,
you're falling back on old habits.
It's because you're overly associated
into that and you see chocolate and you
can't help yourself.
You just go for it.
You see any type of food
that you shouldn't be eating
and you just go for him.
And by the way,
it doesn't have to be for just food.
This could be for any type of
habit you're trying to break.
So with the Swish pattern does,
is you replace that very associated image
of being compelled to do whatever it
is that you don't want to do.
Whatever that habit is.
And you swish it with an image
of yourself, an ideal you,
where you see yourself rather than being
associated you suddenly it's suddenly
swishes to the ideal you,
the person you want to become.
Now the reason why this is so powerful
is because most people are lacking a
vision on the other side of what
it is that is holding them back.
And I'll do another video about this
because what happens is people that say,
okay, I have this problem, I I need
to lose weight. I have this problem.
I need to stop spending so much money.
Uh, you know, I have this problem,
I keep doing this or I keep
doing that. Well, most people,
they only are focused on the problem.
They don't,
they don't have a vision on
the other side of that problem.
So with the switch pattern does,
is it gives you a vision of the you,
you want to be on the
other side of the problem.
And this is tremendously motivational
and gives you that vision to aspire to
rather than just saying, I need to stop
eating so much if you're focused on,
stop on stopping eating.
So much.
Then you're focused on eating rather
than the vision of yourself on the other
side of that. And when you
create that vision of yourself,
you actually want it to be kind of vague.
And then what I mean by that is you don't
want to have it con context specific
and you don't want to have it with
you doing any specific behavior.
The reason for that is if you connect,
not eating the compulsion
to eat with say exercise.
So you swish up an image
of you exercising. Okay,
that'll work sometimes.
But what happens if you wake up in the
middle of the night and you've got the
munchies and suddenly this image of you
switches up of you doing exercise when
the middle of night that's not
even probable or likely to happen.
So you're likely to break this and not
doing the same thing happens for people
who smoke cigarettes that are
addicted to cigarettes and they swish,
they use a swish pattern.
And so they switched the compulsion
to smoke to maybe doing exercise or to
something else that with and were to
wake up and say three in the morning and
really crave a cigarette. They're
not, not likely to go and do.
So you want this to be vague in general,
no specific context,
no specific behavior,
just the ideal you.
And so what you do is you reprogram this
habit by swishing the compulsion away
or down. Or sometimes you can even explode
it and throwing this image up of you,
the ideal you who you want to be.
So any time you feel compelled to go do
the habit or the thing that you don't
want to do,
suddenly you get this image of you that
swishes up automatically without even
having to think about it. And you
go, oh yeah, that's who I want to be,
not this other habit,
which is now gone.
And what's amazing about this is that
when you actually do this process and
you've practiced it many times,
it becomes unconscious.
You practice it enough to where
you don't even think about it.
So it becomes just as unconscious as a
compulsion was to do the thing that you
didn't want to do,
the habit that you didn't want.
It becomes a compulsive
to become that ideal.
You the one who solved this problem,
the one who is whoever you want to be.
It's fascinating how well this works and
most people actually get this process
wrong,
which is why you need to watch the video
that's linked to this video about how
to do it right.
In fact,
I was taught this process wrong by some
of the top NLP teachers in the world and
it wasn't until my mentor Steve Andreas
pointed it out to me how I had this
process wrong and when I changed it,
this process became so much
more effective and LP anchoring.
Many people are really fascinated with
NLP anchoring and then some people say,
oh, that's, that's nothing. It's
just classical conditioning.
That's Pavlov's dogs.
Whenever he rang the bell,
the dogs would salivate because he would
ring the bell and feed them and then
all they had to do was just ring the
bell and the dogs would salivate. Yes.
That anchoring is based on
that type of conditioning.
But before NLP came around,
nobody was really using this to induce
states in themselves or induced states
and other people.
And whenever they were creating an LP
and they were modeling these incredibly
effective therapists,
where they started to notice is that
these therapists were using this type of
conditioning.
Basically they were using their words or
a particular word or emphasis on a word
or a touch to induce a
state in their clients.
So if they were working with their clients
and they started to notice the client
going into a particular resourceful state
where they were sort of open and more
light and they felt more empowered, they
might reach over and touch the person,
or they might say a word,
and then they would repeat the touch
or the word later to see if the person
would go into the state.
And if they did and they knew that they
were anchored and so they would do this
purposefully to put the person in that
state and the founders of NLP realized,
well, we can do this to
ourselves. Probably the most
successful student of NLP,
Tony Robbins uses anchors a lot.
If you see him slap his hands like this,
that's an anchor that he has to
put them into a certain state.
You'll see him hit his chest a lot.
That's an anchor for him as well.
So you can use anchors on yourself
to induce particular states,
resourceful states that you want to be in,
especially if you're about
to give a presentation,
you could touch wherever you put your
anchor at and go into that resource will
stay whenever you give that presentation.
Now this can also be used in persuasion
to put people in the states that make
them more likely to buy from you.
And some people can get very,
very clever with this and
they can actually anchor
people with their eyebrows.
Um, they can make a certain face when
they notice a person is going into a
particular state.
So all they have to do is make that face
again at the person and they will go in.
They will be anchored to that.
And then we'll go into that.
State might be thinking, well, how
do I do this? Actually you can start.
The first step to being good at anchoring
is to recognize how you're already
anchored and your own life.
You go into the room,
you go into the bathroom and suddenly
you feel like you have to go.
Even though before you stepped into it,
you didn't feel that at all.
That's an anchor. So we have spatial
anchors as well are somebody,
you see somebody smile a certain
way, like uh, the, your partner,
you see them smile a certain way and
suddenly you get these feelings that are
triggered and it's not just any smile,
it's a very particular smile.
So start noticing how you're already
anchored and everyday life and notice how
you may have anchored
other people around you.
There's a really funny skit or a
really funny segment, and the office,
the American version of the office
where one of the characters,
every time he boots up his computer
and the sound comes on like God,
it's like a Microsoft sound, like a
little jingle comes up. He offers his,
uh, his coworker across from him an
Altoid. And so every time he does that,
he offers him the outside.
He does this enough times that finally
one time he just boots up his computer
and he doesn't even offer
his coworker and alto,
but the coworker opens up his
hand ready for the altcoin.
That would be an example of he
anchored his coworker to that sound.
So you can anchor with touches,
you can anchor with sounds and you can
even anchor with tastes and smells.
If you've ever walked down a street and
you smelled a certain smell and they
brought you back to another time or
brought you back to another feeling.
I get this a lot whenever I smelled books,
I think of memories that I've had in
libraries or memories that I've had when I
was in school.
Or you can maybe taste something and it
reminds you of your grandmother's a dish
that she used to make for you that that
was your favorite dish and it brings you
back. It brings back all
those memories. Well,
you're just taking all this stuff
that you're naturally doing anyway.
When you associate sounds,
touches and smells and tastes to states,
and you're doing this on purpose so that
you can then engineer the states that
you want to experience, especially
when you want to experience them.
It's about getting more
control over your states.
NLP is also very well known for
language patterns, so language patterns.
That's the l and NLP neural linguistic
programming language is basically the
code of how we think when we think we
often think of thoughts as language.
We think of words a lot of times
that our thoughts, our words,
and just by listening to
someone's language patterns.
When you start to learn NLP and
you start to learn these patterns,
it starts to give you a map of their
reality and you can also turn this on
yourself of course and listen to your
own language and then you can start,
you can start to understand how you
create that map of reality for yourself.
Now you might be thinking,
what do you mean by map of reality?
We don't interact with reality directly.
We interact with reality
through our filters and the
first filters that we have,
our five senses, there may be more
to reality but we can't sense it.
We can only sense through five different
senses and so once we receive this
information, we have to coat it in
order to make sense of it and we also,
we can't take it in all at once.
We can't take in 100% of all sensory
based information all at once.
It would be too overwhelming.
We wouldn't be able to make
sense of the information,
we wouldn't be able to make decisions.
So we have to code it,
we have to limit it, we have to delete
some of it. We have to distort some of it.
We have to generalize some of it. And
language is a huge part of how we do this.
And so NLP language patterns is a way of
understanding how you're creating your
reality. Your language is a huge clue to
that and how other people are doing it.
And once you understand how you create
your own reality, then you can change it.
And this is what makes
NLP so extraordinary.
And then if you noticing it and other
people, you can help them as a therapist,
you can help them as a coach are.
You can persuade them if you're in sales,
if you start to understand how they're
constructed reality, then you can better,
you're better able to influence
them to shift it into change it.
NLP eye movement patterns are NLP eye
accessing cues are also something NLP is
very well known for.
And then it starts to get a little,
because people start to say that you
can detect liars are people when they're
lying by their eye movements.
And I would say not quite.
It's one piece of evidence that can
help you in detecting deception.
But I wouldn't depend
only on eye movements.
So what they found in NLP is that we
look in certain directions when we're
accessing certain neurology or when
we're accessing certain sensory
representations,
sensory internal sensory representations.
So for example, you see images
in your head or in your mind,
you see movies in your mind, you hear
things in your mind, you can, you know,
when you think of your memories, you're
recreating them in your, in your mind,
you're not accessing externally,
they're coming from within.
So these are things that you can see,
hear,
feel what you can do all the five senses
internally and represent those. So,
and NLP would they started the fine
was that we tend to look in certain
directions depending on what
we're accessing. So for example,
if I'm constructing an image in my mind,
something I've never seen before,
but it's something I'm imagining,
I will tend to look up into my right.
If I'm remembering something I've seen
before, I will tend to look up to my left.
If I'm hearing something, I will tend
to look in either direction of my ears.
Typically to the right one,
I'm creating something the left when I'm
remembering something and then I looked
down to my right when I'm accessing either
emotional feelings are feelings in my
body. I looked down to my left
when I'm talking to myself.
That's the internal dialogue.
Now here's the problem with this is,
and I'm going to do a
complete video on this,
on how to overcome the problems of this.
The problem with this is we
can do a variety of things.
If I'm associated into an image,
just like I was talking
about with the Swish pattern,
I can feel like I'm actually in the
memory and if I'm actually in the memory,
then I may look to my right or to my
left as if I'm looking at the person who
was in the memory who was next to me.
And that doesn't mean I'm
hearing something. That means
I'm actually in my mind,
in the memory looking at the person.
And then there's also a timeline,
and I'll do a video on
this too. Um, when we look,
when we have our timelines and some
people put their timelines out in front of
them,
I may be looking to my past
or to my future and that
can affect my eye movements
as well. The thing they
remember about eye movement,
so is to track them with the person that
you're working with and you can start
to again understand how
they're creating their reality.
Where are they putting their images,
how are they accessing memories?
And when you start to understand this
again and it gives you a tremendous amount
of influence.
Now to use it on yourself,
which you can also do is if you find that
you're dealing with a problem in your
eye,
movements go to one specific direction
every time you experienced that problem,
every time you think about that problem,
try moving your eyes to the opposite
direction or at any other place besides
that one.
And think about the problem that this
is really fascinating because you're
accessing different neurology
in a different part of
your mind and your brain.
A lot of times you will find
the solution you looking for.
The problem was is the stuckness was you
were stuck accessing only a very small
part of your neurology.
But when you access the problem within
yourself and you start going to different
parts of your neurology,
a lot of times you can find the solution
to it right there and it feels like you
become unstuck and you find what it is
the answer to whatever the problem was
that you were stuck in.
Values elicitation is probably one of the
more overlooked but extremely powerful
techniques in an LP would
values elicitation does,
is it makes you realize what motivates
you and it makes you realize that
whatever you, whatever you
think you want on the surface,
that there's so much more to it.
And the more you can understand that,
the more you can already
access it within yourself.
The building block of NLP was the
present state versus the desired state.
So I have a present state,
which is, I want something,
which means I feel like
I'm in lack or scarcity.
The desired state is I get what I want.
So let's say I want to make
$1 million. So my desires, my,
my present state is
I'm lacking $1 million.
So the desired state would be what
$1 million will make me feel like,
okay,
notice I said the desired
state and feeling of what
$1 million will make me feel
because we don't actually have
any use for money at all. As a,
as a substance, as a
green paper, it's nothing.
It's the value we project onto it and
cumulatively we project value onto money,
but it's not the same for all of us.
$100 to a beggar or a person or a person
who is homeless is going to be a lot,
is going to have a lot more value than
a millionaire. When a millionaire,
it looks at $100 versus
the homeless person.
There's a distinct difference
between the value of that money.
So it's completely subjective when,
so when you think about the,
the goals that you want to achieve,
the success that you want you,
a lot of people think that it's the thing
that will get them, that the new car,
the big house, the trophy wife, whatever
it is, you start asking a question,
okay, we'll, what would $1 million to do
for me? What would a new car do for me?
What's important about a new house?
And now I have to sort of detach from
the object and go deeper into what are my
values about that? What is, what is the
value that I'm projecting onto that?
And eventually if you keep this up,
you will understand that a lot of this
will lead to a lot of the things that you
want actually lead to high level
values like peace, happiness and joy.
And then you have to ask yourself,
well wait a minute, can I access peace,
joy and happiness within myself now?
And then if I can do that,
does it make it easier for me or
harder for me to get what I want now?
I think I know, I think you
know what the answer to that is.
If I can access these high level values
within myself now and we all can at any
time,
even though it may not feel that way,
but if I can access that now and then go
after the million dollars feeling happy
and whole and fulfilled and
at peace with myself, yeah,
it's going to be a lot easier to get
that million dollars or that new car or
that new house. So this is why
values elicitation is so powerful.
It also lets you know what is
motivating you and how do you draw,
how do you connect the
dots from the material,
a material object or the goal that
you want to achieve or the outcome to
fulfillment of your highest values.
And when you're fulfilling
your highest values,
that's when life takes on purpose
meaning and all that joy and happiness,
what you're seeking, your, you
become the living embodiment of that.
So that's what we're really after.
It just on the surface level consciously,
it seems like we want all these objects.
So we went all these things or we want
all these achievements and all of those
things are great. There's nothing
wrong with any of those things.
But if you're going to go after them,
you may as well go after them accessing
those values already feeling happy,
whole abundant and wealthy now,
and then go after your goals.
And it'll make us so much easier.
And it actually makes it
extremely enjoyable instead
of what a lot of people are
doing,
which is they withhold joy and pleasure
for themselves as they go after a goal.
I can't be happy until I have this.
I can't feel joy and,
and I can't be at peace
until I achieved this.
You're just cutting off all of those
resources in that wonderful state that
would help enable you to get that.
And so now you've just made
it so much harder for you.
So values elicitation gets your mind on
the other side of achieving what it is
that you want.
And when you come from that place,
achieving what you want becomes show
much easier and so much more enjoyable.
So like I said,
if you want to go deeper with any
one are all of these NLP techniques,
check the card that's
