hello and welcome back to the channel so in this 
lecture we are going to talk about some challenges  
that you might face if you are implementing big 
data in your organization so without further ado  
let's get into it so nowadays no organization can 
function without a huge amount of data these days  
so big data challenges includes the best way of 
handling the numerous amount of data which will  
involve the process of storing then analyzing a 
huge set of information on various data stores  
so there are major challenges that come into way 
when we are dealing with big data which needs to  
be taken care of and now we are going to see each 
challenge one by one and how we can resolve them  
so the first challenge is lack of knowledge 
professionals so to run these modern technologies  
and a larger data sets companies needs a skilled 
data professionals so this will include data  
scientists data analysts and data engineers to 
work with the tools and make sense of a giant  
data set so one of the big data challenges that 
any company might face is a lack of massive data  
professionals so this is often because of the data 
handling tools which have rapidly evolved but in  
most cases the professional haven't so now we will 
see what are the actionable steps that we need to  
take care to bridge this gap so the main solution 
being here is the company's has to invest extra  
money in recruitment of skilled professionals 
and they even have to supply training programs  
to the prevailing staff to us foremost out of 
them another important steps taken by organization  
is purchasing knowledge analytics solution which 
is powered by ai and ml so these big data tools  
are often traveled by professionals who aren't 
data science experts but at least they have some  
basic knowledge so this step will help companies 
to save a lot of cash for the recruitment  
the second challenge is the lack of proper 
understanding of how massive the data is so  
the companies fail in their big data initiatives 
all thanks to the insufficient understanding so  
employees might not know what data is its storage 
processing importance and the different sources  
so data professional may know what's happening but 
the others might not have a transparent picture  
for example if employees don't understand the 
importance of knowledge storage they could not  
keep the backup of sensitive data and they 
could not use databases properly for storage  
as a result when this important data is required 
it can't be retrieved easily so we can overcome  
this by the big data workshop and seminars which 
must be held by companies for everybody also  
military training programs must be arranged for 
all the workers who handles the data regularly  
and the neighborhood of large data projects so all 
levels of the organization must include some basic  
understanding of knowledge concepts that way 
we can overcome this insufficient understanding  
within the organization the next challenge is data 
growth issues so one of the four most pressing  
challenges of massive data is storing this huge 
set of knowledge properly so the quantity of data  
being stored in a data center and databases of 
companies is increasing at a huge amount so as  
this data sets grows exponentially with time it 
gets challenging to handle and most of the info  
is unstructured and comes from either documents or 
videos audios text files and other sources so this  
suggests that you cannot find them in the database 
so companies choose modern techniques to handle  
this large dataset like compression tiering and 
deduplication so this compression is employed for  
reducing the number of bits within the data thus 
reducing its overall size and the deduplication  
is the process of removing the duplicate and 
unwanted data from a knowledge set so this data  
tiering allows companies to store data in several 
storage tiers so this will ensure that the info  
is residing within the most appropriate space of 
storing so companies are also choosing big data  
tools like hadoop nosql and other technologies 
to encounter this issue so the next challenge is  
and it's really important to understand which is 
confusion while selecting a proper big data tool  
so companies often get confused while selecting 
the simplest tool for giant data analysis and  
storage so you might ask questions like we should 
use hbase or cassandra for simple data storage  
as well as is hadoop map reduce okay or sparks be 
far better option for data analytics and storage  
so this question will bother companies and 
sometimes they are unable to seek out the answer  
and they find themselves making poor decision 
and selecting the improper technology as a result  
money time and efforts are wasted so how we can 
tackle this you will either hire experienced  
professionals who know far more about these tools 
differently is to travel for giant data consulting  
so here consultants will provide a recommendation 
of the simplest tool supporting your company  
scenario so it totally depends which type of 
data your company is consuming as well as the  
size of the data set so supporting the advice you 
will compute a technique then select the simplest  
tool for you so the next challenge is data 
security so securing this huge set of knowledge  
is one of the daunting challenges of massive data 
so often companies are so busy in understanding  
storing cleaning and analyzing their data that 
they push data security for later stages but it  
is not recommended this is often not sensible move 
as a unprotected data can become breeding grounds  
for malicious hackers and companies nowadays can 
lose up to 3.7 million dollars for a stolen record  
or a knowledge breach so how we can solve this 
problem so nowadays companies are recruiting more  
cyber security professionals to guard their data 
and as well as other steps for securing big data  
includes data encryption data segregation identity 
and access control and using the big data security  
tools like ibm guardian and the last challenge 
being integrating data from variety of sources so  
data in a corporation comes from various sources 
so we can take example like social media pages  
erp applications financial reports presentation 
customer logs emails and the reports created by  
the employees so for combining all these data to 
organize reports may be a challenging task so this  
is a neighborhood which often neglected by the 
firms so data integration is a very crucial step  
for analysis reporting and business intelligence 
so what is the solution for this companies need to  
solve a data integration problem by purchasing the 
proper tools and use them so there are number of  
simplest data integration tools such as talent 
center price data integrator ibm infosphere  
x plenty informatica power center microsoft sql 
quick view and clover dx so this is some tool  
for a good data integration so this was all the 
major challenges which you can face if you are  
implementing big data in your company and how we 
can tackle them so if you like this lecture please
