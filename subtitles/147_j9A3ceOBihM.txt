alright with that out of the way let's
get into it
to understand qualitative data analysis
we need to understand qualitative data
so let's take a step back and ask the
question what
exactly is qualitative data well
qualitative data
refers to pretty much any data that's
not numbers
in other words it's not stuff that you
measure using a
fixed scale or complex statistics or
mathematics
so if it's not numbers what is it
words you guessed well sometimes yes
qualitative data can and often does take
the form of
interview transcripts documents and
open-ended survey responses
but it can also involve the
interpretation of
images and videos in other words
qualitative data
isn't just limited to text-based data so
how's that different from quantitative
data well simply
put qualitative research focuses on
words descriptions concepts or ideas
while quantitative research focuses on
numbers
and statistics qualitative research
investigates the
softer side of things to explore and
describe
while quantitative research focuses on
the hard
numbers to measure differences between
variables
and the relationships between them if
you're keen to learn more about the
differences between
qual and quant we've got a detailed post
over on the grad coach blog
i'll include a link below now you might
be thinking
qualitative is probably easier than
quantitative
right well not quite in many ways
qualitative data can be incredibly
challenging and
time consuming to analyze and interpret
at the end of your data collection phase
which takes a lot of time in and of
itself
you'll likely have pages and pages of
text-based data or hours upon hours of
audio to work through
you might have subtle nuances of
interactions or discussions
that have danced around in your mind or
that you've scribbled down in messy
field notes
making sense of all of this is no small
task
and you shouldn't underestimate it so
long story short
qualitative analysis can be a lot of
work
don't stress though in this video we'll
explore qualitative data analysis
qda for short by looking at the six most
popular analysis methods these qda
methods can be used on
primary data data you've collected
yourself or secondary data
data that's already been published by
someone else so
without further delay let's get into it
right let's start by outlining the
analysis methods and then we'll
dive into the details for each one the
six most popular qda methods
or at least the ones we see at grad
coach are
number one qualitative content analysis
number two narrative analysis number
three discourse analysis number four
thematic analysis number five
grounded theory and number six
ipa if that all sounds like gibberish
don't worry we will explore each of them
in this video
so let's do it
first up is a qda method called
qualitative content analysis
or just content analysis for short
content analysis is possibly the most
common and straightforward qda method at
the simplest level
content analysis is used to evaluate
patterns within a piece of content
for example words phrases or images
or across multiple pieces of content or
sources of communication
for example a collection of newspaper
articles or political speeches
with content analysis you could for
instance
identify the frequency with which an
idea
is shared or spoken about like the
number of times a kardashian is
mentioned on twitter
or you could identify patterns of deeper
underlying interpretations for instance
by
identifying phrases or words in tourist
pamphlets
that highlight india as an ancient
country
because content analysis can be used in
such a wide variety of ways
it's important to go into your analysis
with a very specific
question and goal or you'll get lost in
the fog
with content analysis you'll group large
amounts of text
into codes summarize these into
categories
and possibly even tabulate the data to
calculate the frequency
of certain concepts or variables because
of this
content analysis provides a small splash
of quantitative thinking within
a qualitative method naturally while
content analysis is
widely useful it's not without drawbacks
one of the main issues with content
analysis is that it can be
very time consuming as it requires lots
of reading and
re-reading of the text also because of
its multi-dimensional focus
on both qualitative and quantitative
aspects
it is sometimes accused of losing
important nuances in communication
content analysis also tends to
concentrate on a
very specific timeline and doesn't take
into account what happened before
or after that timeline this isn't
necessarily a bad
thing though just something to be aware
of so keep these factors in mind if
you're considering content analysis
every analysis method has its drawbacks
so don't be put off by these
just be aware of them
right let's take a look at the next qda
method
narrative analysis
okay next in line we have a powerful
qualitative analysis method called
narrative analysis
as the name suggests narrative analysis
is all about
listening to people telling stories and
analyzing what that means
since stories serve a functional purpose
of helping us make sense of the world
we can gain insights into the ways that
people deal with
and make sense of reality by analyzing
their stories and the ways they're told
you could
for example use narrative analysis to
explore whether
how something being said is important
for instance the narrative of a prisoner
trying to justify their crime
could provide insight into their view of
the world and the justice system
similarly analyzing the ways
entrepreneurs talk
about the struggles in their careers or
cancer patients telling stories of hope
could provide powerful insights into
their mindsets
and perspectives in other words
narrative analysis
is about paying attention to the stories
that people tell and
more importantly the way they tell them
of course the narrative approach has its
weaknesses just like
all analysis methods sample sizes are
generally quite small due to the
time-consuming process
of capturing narratives because of this
along with the multitude of social and
lifestyle factors
which can influence a subject narrative
analysis can be quite difficult to
reproduce in subsequent research this
means that it's difficult to test the
findings of some of this research
similarly research bias can have a
strong
influence on the results here so you
need to be particularly careful
about the potential biases that you can
bring
into your analysis when using this
method nevertheless
narrative analysis is still a very
useful
qualitative method just keep these
limitations in mind and be careful
not to draw broad conclusions
all right let's take a look at the next
qda method
discourse analysis
number three on the list is discourse
analysis
discourse is simply a fancy word for
written or spoken language or debate so
discourse analysis is all about
analyzing
language within its social context in
other words
analyzing language such as a
conversation a speech etc
within the culture and society it takes
place in
for example you could analyze how a
janitor speaks to a ceo
or how politicians speak about terrorism
to truly understand these conversations
or speeches
the culture and history of those
involved in the communication
is important for example a janitor
might speak more casually with the ceo
in a company that emphasizes equality
among workers similarly a politician
might speak
more about terrorism if there was a
recent
terrorist incident in the country so as
you can see
by using discourse analysis you can
identify
how culture history or power dynamics to
name a few
have an effect on the way concepts are
spoken about
so if your research aims and objectives
involve
understanding culture or power dynamics
discourse analysis can be a powerful
method
because there are many social influences
in how we speak to each other
the potential use of discourse analysis
is
vast of course this also means it's
important to have
a very specific research question
or questions in mind when analyzing your
data
and looking for patterns and themes or
you
might end up going down a winding rabbit
hole
discourse analysis can also be very time
consuming as you need to sample the data
to the point of saturation
in other words until no new information
and insights emerge but this is of
course
part of what makes discourse analysis
such a powerful technique
so keep these factors in mind when
considering
this qda method
right so far we've covered content
analysis
narrative analysis which analyzes
stories
and discourse analysis which analyzes
conversations and interactions
next up we've got thematic analysis
which focuses on themes and patterns
let's jump into that
thematic analysis looks at patterns of
meaning in a data set
for example a set of interviews or focus
group transcripts
but what exactly does that mean well a
thematic analysis takes bodies of data
which are often quite large
and groups them according to
similarities
in other words themes these themes help
us make sense of the context and derive
meaning from it
let's take a look at an example with
thematic analysis you could analyze
100 reviews of a popular sushi
restaurant
to find out what patrons think about the
place by reviewing the data
you would then identify the themes that
crop up repeatedly within the data
for example fresh ingredients or
friendly wait
staff so as you can see thematic
analysis can be
pretty useful for finding out about
people's experiences
views and opinions therefore if your
research aims and objectives
involve understanding people's
experience or
view of something thematic analysis can
be a great
choice systematic analysis is a bit of
an exploratory process
it's not unusual for your research
questions to develop or even change as
you progress
through the analysis while this is
somewhat natural in exploratory research
it can also be seen as a disadvantage as
it means that the data
needs to be re-reviewed each time a
research question is adjusted
so basically thematic analysis can be
quite time consuming but for a good
reason
so keep this in mind if you choose to
use thematic analysis
for your project and budget extra time
for
unexpected adjustments
right let's hop on to the next qda
method of choice
grounded theory
all right it's time to get grounded well
kinda grounded theory is a powerful
qualitative analysis method where the
intention is to create a
new theory or theories using the data at
hand
through a series of tests and revisions
for example you could try to develop a
theory about what factors
influence students to watch a youtube
video about
qualitative analysis the important thing
with grounded theory
is that you go into the analysis with an
open mind
and let the data speak for itself rather
than dragging
in existing hypotheses or theories into
your analysis
in other words your analysis must
develop from the ground
up hence the name in grounded theory you
start with a
general overarching question about a
given population
for example graduate students then you
begin to analyze a small sample like
five graduate students in a department
at a university
ideally this sample should be reasonably
representative of the broader population
you'd then interview these students to
identify what factors led them to watch
the video
after analyzing the interview data a
general hypothesis
or pattern could emerge you might notice
that graduate students are more likely
to read a post about qualitative methods
if they are just starting on their
dissertation journey
or if they have an upcoming test about
research methods
from here you'll look for another small
sample
maybe five more graduate students in a
different department
and see whether this pattern or this
hypothesis holds true for them
if not you'll look for more
commonalities and adapt your theory
accordingly
as this process continues the theory
develops
what's important with grounded theory is
that the theory develops from the data
not from some preconceived idea you need
to let the data
speak for itself so what are the
drawbacks of grounded theory
well some do argue that there's a tricky
circularity to grounded theory
for it to work in principle you should
know as
little as possible regarding the
research question and population
this helps you reduce the amount of bias
in your interpretation
however in many circumstances it's also
thought to be very
unwise to approach a research question
without knowledge of the current
literature
so basically it's a bit of a chicken
or the egg situation regardless grounded
theory remains a popular
and a powerful option it can be a very
useful method when you're researching a
topic that is completely new
or has very little existing research
about it
it allows you to start from scratch and
work your way from the ground
up
right time for us to move on to the
final qualitative analysis method
ipa let's jump into it
interpretive phenomenological analysis
ipa okay no let's just stick with ipa
okay ipa is designed to help you
understand the personal experiences of a
subject
for example a person or a group of
people
concerning a major life event an
experience or a situation
this event or experience is the
phenomenon or
phenomena that makes up the p in
ipa these phenomena may range from
relatively
common experiences such as motherhood or
being involved in a car accident
to those which are extremely rare for
example
someone's personal experience in a
refugee camp
so ipa is a great choice if
your research involves analyzing
people's
personal experiences of something that
happened to them
it's important to remember that ipa is
subject centered it's focused on the
experiencer
this means that while you'll likely use
a coding system to identify
commonalities
it is important not to lose the depth of
experience
or meaning by trying to reduce
everything to codes
also keep in mind that since your sample
size will generally be
very small with ipa you often will
not be able to draw a broad conclusions
about the generalizability of your
findings
but that's okay as long as it aligns
with your research aims
and objectives now another thing to be
aware of with ipa
is personal bias while researcher bias
can creep into all forms of research
self-awareness is critically important
with ipa
as it can have a major impact on the
results
for example a researcher who was a
victim of a crime himself
could insert his own feelings of
frustration
and anger into the way that he
interprets the experience of someone who
was kidnapped
so if you're going to undertake ipa you
need to be
very self-aware or you could muddy the
analysis
keep these limitations and pitfalls in
mind and you
will have a powerful analysis tool in
your arsenal
all right so there we have it the six
most popular qualitative data analysis
methods
that we work with here at grad coach so
at this point you're probably asking
yourself the question
how do i choose the right one well
selecting the right
qualitative analysis method largely
depends
on your research aims objectives and
questions
in other words the best tool for the job
depends on what you're trying to build
for example perhaps your research aims
to
analyze the use of words and what they
reveal about the intention of the
storyteller and the cultural context of
the time
perhaps your research aims to develop an
understanding
of the unique personal experiences of
people that have experienced a certain
event
or perhaps your research aims to develop
insight regarding the influence of a
certain culture on its members
as you can see all of these research
aims are distinctly different
and therefore different analysis methods
would be suitable for each one
also remember that each method has its
own strengths
weaknesses and general limitations
no single analysis method is perfect
so it often makes sense to adopt more
than one method
this is called triangulation but this
is also quite time consuming
as we've seen these approaches all make
use of coding and
theme generating techniques but the
intent
and approach of each analysis method
differs quite substantially
so it is really important to come into
your research
with a clear intention before you even
start thinking about which analysis
method
or methods to use start by reviewing
your research
aims objectives and research questions
to assess what exactly you're trying to
find out
then select a method that fits never
pick
a method just because you like it or
have experience
using it your analysis method or
analysis methods
must align with your broader research
aims and objectives
okay so let's quickly recap on the six
methods firstly we looked at content
analysis
a straightforward method that blends a
little bit of quant
into a primarily qualitative analysis
then we looked at narrative analysis
which is about analyzing how
stories are told next up was discourse
analysis
which is about analyzing conversations
and
interactions then we moved on to
thematic analysis which is about
identifying
themes and patterns from there we went
south with grounded theory which is
about starting from scratch
with a specific question and using the
data
alone to build a theory in response to
that question
and finally we looked at ipa
which is about understanding people's
unique experiences
of a phenomenon now of course these
aren't the
only approaches to qualitative data
analysis
but they are a great starting point if
you're just
dipping your toes into the waters of
qualitative research for the very first
time
