number one perhaps you're thinking about becoming  
a data analyst and want to know exactly what a 
career in the field involves most companies are  
collecting loads of data all the time but in its 
raw form this data doesn't actually mean anything  
this is where data analytics comes in data 
analytics is the process of analyzing raw data  
so that we can pull out insights which are useful 
to companies these insights are super important to  
drive smart business decisions what a data analyst 
does is they take all this complex jigsaw of data  
they take it out and they make it into 
something which you can really use  
having interpreted the data the data analyst can 
then pass these insights on so that the company  
can then make the most informed decisions 
so you can think of data analytics as a  
kind of business intelligence used to solve 
problems and challenges that every company has  
it's all about finding patterns in the data which 
can tell you something useful or relevant about  
the business operations so for instance how 
customers engage with a particular product or  
employees engage with a particular tool armed with 
the insights of data companies are then able to  
make better decisions about their audience company 
as a whole and the industry in which they work in
Step one we looked at what Data Analytics 
actually is in step two we're going to look  
at how data analytics is used so what does data 
analytics actually look like in action and how is  
it used in the real world so the fact is data is 
everywhere so it actually has an infinite amount  
of uses across all kinds of businesses and 
organizations globally broadly speaking data  
analytics is used to make faster and better 
business decisions to reduce overall business  
costs and to develop new and innovative products 
and services in more specific terms data analytics  
might be used to do the following to predict 
future sales or purchasing behaviors for security  
purposes to help and protect against fraud to 
analyze the effectiveness of marketing campaigns  
to boost customer acquisition and retention or 
to increase supply chain efficiency so that gives  
you a little bit of an overview of what data 
analytics can be used for in the real world
Step three let's dive into what a data 
analyst actually does on a day-to-day basis  
if you're thinking about becoming a data analyst 
you're probably interested in the roles and  
responsibilities that you'll have in the field 
based on some real job ads here are some typical  
roles and responsibilities that you'll have to 
undertake as a data analyst manage the delivery  
of user satisfaction surveys and report on 
results using data visualization software  
work with business line owners to develop 
requirements define success metrics  
manage and execute analytical projects and 
evaluate results monitor practices processes  
and systems to identify opportunities for 
improvement translate important questions  
into concrete analytical tasks gather new 
data to answer client questions collating  
and organizing data from multiple sources 
design build test and maintain back-end code  
establish data processes define data quality 
criteria and implement data quality processes  
work as part of a team to evaluate and analyze key 
data that will be used to shape future business  
strategies so those are just some examples of what 
a data analyst would be doing in any given role  
to learn more about the kinds of things that 
you'll be undertaking as a data analyst why  
not search on job boards like linkedin indeed 
and icrunchdata.com so that was step three  
it was just a broad overview of what you 
can expect to be doing as a data analyst
So now we've looked at data analytics as a role 
we're now going to go into the process of data  
analysis so now we're going to outline 
the five main steps a data analyst would  
take when approaching a new project step one 
define the questions that you want to answer  
you need to answer why you're conducting this 
analysis and what questions and answers you  
need to find at this stage you'll take a clearly 
defined problem and then you'll make a hypothesis  
or research question that you can go on and 
answer you'll then need to identify what types  
of data you'll need but importantly where it 
will come from for instance a business problem  
might be that customers aren't subscribing to 
a paid membership once that free trial ends  
your key question can then be what kind 
of strategies can the business implement  
to retain their customer base step two would be 
to collect this data with a clear question in mind  
you're ready to start collecting that data data 
analysts will usually gather data from primary  
sources or internal data that the company already 
has such as CRM software or email marketing tools  
they may tend to secondary or external sources 
such as open data sources so this can include  
data from government portals tools like 
google trends but also data from international  
organizations like the world health organization 
so step three you need to clean scrub that data  
once you've got that data you need to prepare 
it and ready it for analysis your original data  
might include duplicates anomalies or missing data 
which could distort how the data is interpreted  
these all need to be removed data cleaning can be 
a manual task and it can take some time but it's  
crucial if you want to get the right business 
insights step four is to analyze the data now  
for the actual analysis how you analyze the data 
will depend on the question that you're asking  
and the kind of data that you're working 
with but some common techniques include  
regression analysis cluster analysis and time 
series analysis to name just a few we're going to  
go into these analysis terms much deeper in future 
videos but if you have any specific questions now  
drop us a comment in the comments below moving 
on to step 5 we need to interpret and share the  
results the final step in this process is where 
data is turned into valuable business insights  
depending on the type of analysis conducted you'll 
present your findings in a way that others can  
understand in the form of a chart or a graph for 
example at this stage you'll be able to say what  
the data analysis actually shows you in regards 
to your initial question or business challenge  
and you'll collaborate with key stakeholders 
on how to move forward this is a great moment  
to reflect and look at the limitations of your 
data and what further analysis might be conducted  
rounding off step four we're going to move 
on to the next step what skills you need  
to actually become a data analyst in addition to 
the role description and the processes that we've  
described so far data analysts are also expected 
to demonstrate certain skills and abilities  
here are some of the most important hard and soft 
skills that you'll need to become a data analyst

statistical ability data analysts spend a lot  
of their time crunching numbers so you'll need to 
have a mathematical brain you'll have to have some  
working knowledge of programming languages such 
as python oracle and sql data analysts rely on  
a number of programming languages to carry out 
their work this may seem daunting at first but  
it's nothing that can't be learned over time with 
practice you'll also need an analytical mindset  
it's not just about crunching the numbers and 
sharing your data sometimes you'll need to dig  
deeper to understand really what's going on 
it's all in the name an analytical mindset is  
a must remember data analytics is about answering 
questions and solving business challenges and that  
requires some keen problem-solving skills data 
analysts have a wide variety of tools at their  
disposal and you'll need to know which one to use 
and when you'll also need excellent communication  
skills once you've harvested your data for 
valuable insights it's important to share your  
findings so that it benefits the business data

business stakeholders and they may be responsible
