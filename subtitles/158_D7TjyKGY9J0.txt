hello lovely humans jen fox here
in this video we are going to look at
how to do sentiment analysis
in microsoft excel for free
party time so this service is available
in
office 365. well in excel
and so it's an add-in that you can
incorporate from azure machine learning
and it allows us to do sentiment
analysis basically
if i'm looking at some text the
sentiment analysis
will tell me if the text is a
positive sentiment if someone is feeling
you know positive about something
or if someone's feeling negative about
something
it's keep in mind like most machine
learning
it's you know not perfect just like
people
and it tends to work on shorter text
versus
longer text so that said
let's dig in to how we pull in
sentiment analysis into excel and how we
run it on
our data yay all right so
this is how to do sentiment analysis
for free in microsoft excel woohoo
i was really stoked when i found out
about this feature
um and even more stoked that it's free
so to do this first we need some
text i snagged reviews
about the xbox um so i just i grabbed
them from amazon
uh yeah so let's see if we can get the
sentiment
of each review so we can better
understand if folks
liked it or they didn't like it so
first go to the insert tab in excel
and then go to my add-ins click
see all and we want to add in this
azure machine learning add-in if you
don't have it
highlighted you probably don't just
search for azure machine
learning and click enter and then you
would click
add and then we say continue
and it will pop up woohoo so
then we want to do text sentiment
analysis
okay so it's a little
funky how it expects the data so the
first thing
is click on this view schema
schema schema and we need to
title our uh column header with
tweet underscore text because that
is how the sentiment analysis recognizes
the text in this column is to be
analyzed
and i was running it at one point and i
had an extra space in there and it
gave me an error so make sure it's just
like this
actually let's do that as a well i'll
show you after
i guess so make sure it looks exactly
like this
then we can close that and
then we want to give our input range
values i was just
testing this um so then we
highlight whoopsies we can click on this
oop
come on click on this no
what what is happening okay there we go
okay
so we click on this to highlight
all of the text that we want to analyze
and then we just need to give um a
single output cell um so for some reason
i can't see this
button so i'm just going to be lazy and
copy this
and click this and say c1 so we'll skip
column b and just put in c
um and really quickly it has to just be
a single
column critical
and make sure that my data has headers
is selected
um and i would also recommend selecting
include headers
okay so then we will say predict
and hopefully everything's right yay so
in the
uh first column we have the sentiment
output
and then we in the right column we have
the score so
sentiment analysis is done on a scale of
zero to one
a 0.5 is considered to be neutral
a score closer to 1 is considered to be
positive
and a score closer to 0 is considered to
be negative
so one thing that i want to point out
and close this to give us more
space is that this negative score
is larger than this negative score
so you might
you might find that this review is
more quote unquote negative than
this review um so that's one way to
interpret that
another way to interpret it is just that
the machine learning algorithm
was more confident that this was a
negative sentiment
and so as we go down
this one's kind of interesting this is
actually a
and it looks like the sentiment analysis
didn't do great on it
because the first sentence is positive
um so
yeah i would say that this is a positive
review
so this is you know it's a useful tool
but i have
found that it tends to work better on
shorter
text so one of the things that we could
do
is you know remove some of this text and
run the sentiment analysis again
so i'm going to click this and see if it
changes this score
all right and so we don't need to change
anything here
oh that's interesting
it might be that the phrasing is a
little funky um so
it's not perfect but if you have a lot
of text data this can give you a general
understanding of sentiment um and then
really quickly i just want to show you
what error gets thrown
if this isn't quite right so if you have
an extra space and you click to predict
[Music]
i'm gonna laugh if it doesn't actually
give me an error this time
it's really funny predict there we go
okay so message um
input column name column names must
match the schema
column names only in schema
tweet text and then um yeah
so basically if you read that it it
tells you
in effect that your column header is is
funky
um so then i remove the extra space
and i click predict again and no error
all right cool so i hope that is helpful
uh this is a free service that comes
with
office 365. go forth and enjoy it
let me know if you have any questions
happy making my friends
