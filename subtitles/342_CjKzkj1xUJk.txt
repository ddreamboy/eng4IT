hey guys welcome to testing universe
in this video we are going to understand
about software development lifecycle
in our introductory video about what is
software testing
we have understood about software but
we have to understand now how exactly we
are going to
build a software right so to
develop any software software
development life cycle
is an approach we have to follow right
so what exactly is this particular
software development life cycle
how exactly it will guide us you know in
developing a software
we will try to understand everything in
detail about this
so what is software development life
cycle
it's a systematic and step-by-step
approach to develop a software you will
be having a systematic
as well as different steps will be there
right
with that approach we are going to
develop a software
so software development life cycle it
describes
different phases involved in the
development process
if you want to develop anything right
you will be having
you are you will be you know dividing
that particular
entire development into different phases
right or different steps we can consider
for now
right once we go in detail about this
you will understand about what are these
different phases
it describes different you know steps
involved in the development process and
it also you know
gives the detailed roles involved in
each phase
means okay step one i'm doing something
in that what all roles roles in the
sense what are
which all persons which are you know
involved
and what are those that person roles
right it this entire software
development life cycle will give you
a detailed overview of uh
how exactly you know you are going to
approach to develop a software
and then who are all involved in that
particular uh
you know approach right so
we'll go ahead and understand right what
are those phases
right you can see here in this diagram
these are the different
phases which are involved in developing
a software
so what are these phases the first phase
is requirement phase
the second phase is analysis phase third
phase is design phase
fourth phase is development phase fifth
phase is testing
sixth phase is deployment and then
seventh
phase is maintenance okay we'll
understand about all these phases in
detail
right but you can see here what is this
requirement we have to go
in detail about this and this is one
phase or one step
right and then overall involved right in
this particular phase
so before we go in detail and understand
like how exactly you know we are going
to
approach all these different phases we
will take
a a day-to-day uh activity
which will be done by most of the human
beings right
just to give a broader picture or just
to give
an overview of how exactly you know it
is
it has similarities to develop a
software
i am going to you know take an example
of
right constructing a house or
constructing
an apartment or anything right so we
will take up that example
that's a generic example i am going to
take so that you will understand
you will understand what exactly you
know a person will do
while constructing a house so similarly
we will apply the same rules
uh in software development right so if i
if i want to construct a house okay uh
let me
let me just go in detail about this
right i want to
you know construct a house so i will be
having certain
requirements my own requirements to
construct a house right
so what are those requirements first
first i will
you know tell i need i want to construct
a house
with three bedrooms
and three
bathrooms and i want to have
a nice right garden
in front
and whatever this three bedroom this
house should be a
duplex house
okay and i need to have a nice garden i
need
a you know car parking
space for two cars
okay we can we can consider it as big
cars
two big cars and then i i want to have
a parking space
for two bikes
just just you know there might be a
number of requirements i'm just
you know giving you with these
requirements we're giving you an
overview okay so let's let's
uh you know consider a person by name
xyz right
or we can we can also take it take him
as tom
right tom wants to construct a house
with these requirements
so what he will do he will either
approach
an individual you know a builder
he he might approach an individual
builder
or a company he might approach
uh an individual builder or a company
okay let's say he has he has approached
a company right and then he will say
right these are my requirements i want
to construct my house
i have a plot of 60
by 40 right in this i want to construct
a duplex house with all these
requirements okay so this is called a
requirement
phase means tom tom
if you consider the company this company
or individual
will be a developer okay or a construct
construction company or you can consider
them as a builder or developer
okay you can consider them as a builder
or a developer
and this particular term will be a
client to this builder or developer
he will be a client to these builders so
the client is going to approach the
developer or the development company or
the builder company
to develop a house
with all these requirements okay he will
give the requirements
so from from this company or from
if he is an individual builder any any
one person
okay will be assigned and that person
for example by name henry
okay he is going to gather the
requirements he is going to
take all the requirements of the tom and
then what he will do
he will analyze all these requirements
okay okay tom i can
uh you know come up with uh some design
for you
i can come up with some design for you
so he will what he will do
since the there from the builder company
they are going to give the design how
exactly the design would be
the design would be like uh
the architecture
right the design would be the
architecture
or the you know high level
high level details about the house
which means they will give it a diagram
in such a way that okay
the entrance will come here the uh you
know sit out will come here the hall
will come here
like that a bigger picture
along with that they will you know give
you
a 3d model
which is the detailed design
which is a detailed design
what is this detailed design okay in the
hall what all you know
my new details will be there that level
of detailing will be given in this
particular 3d model
okay so this is called this is called
right low level or
detailed design
is called low level or details means in
detail everything will be explained
in this is this is a high level
architecture okay this is how it looks
and then in detail uh each and every uh
you know room each and every
uh requirement will be considered so
after
after uh you know giving all these
design if
if you are okay with the design you will
tell the company
right okay i'm okay with the design
let's start building the house
otherwise if you need any modifications
you will say no no
i need some changes in this particular
you know design
so you can make those changes so that we
can go ahead with the
construction so let's say you you have
you know
come to an agreement okay i am i'm okay
with this particular
design let's uh you know start the
construction
so the henry's role
gathering the requirement will be over
once henry gathers the requirement the
design and everything will be done by
some other person
okay there will be a separate team for
designing
design team they will give you the
design
design team will give you the design
once that is done
there will be a different set of people
right to construct the house
okay
to construct the house different set of
people will be there okay
so
construction engineers and
workers let's take this right so
as soon as uh they start the
construction right there will be lot of
agreements okay this this is the pricing
and all those details will be considered
and then once everything
is agreed the you know construction of
the house will start
and then once the construction starts
okay at the design phase you might
be having certain uh you know ideas but
when the
construction of the house starts you
might uh you know
as as and when the progress goes you
might come up with
different ideas also if the there is an
agreement between uh
you know the client and the uh
company right or the developer then only
they
are going to allow the changes otherwise
as per the design the construction will
happen once the construction is complete
it will be handed over to the it will be
handed over to the
client right so that's how we are going
to construct our house means
if if i want to construct a house also i
am following a
step by step approach in a similar
fashion if i want to develop any
software
we have to follow a step-by-step
approach
to develop a software so what exactly
will happen in each and
you try to you know analyze whatever i
have given as an example for the
construction company
because that that will remain in a
in your day-to-day life you will be
doing or you will be seeing all those
activities
and you can compare the same thing with
these particular requirements okay
so let's understand everything in detail
about this particular software
development life cycle
the first phase is requirement phase in
this phase what happens
business analyst collects requirements
from client
or customer and documents the
requirement
which is called business requirement
specification document
okay the role is business and list the
business analyst from
from the you know development company
will
sit with the client or customer there
will be an individual
or maybe group of people from the
customer end
and the business analyst will meet
together
and then the client will explain all his
requirements
to the business analyst and then after
you know collecting all the requirements
of the client
business and list will create a document
which is called business requirement
specification document
which is brs or it can also be called as
uh customer requirement specification
document
right so that is the requirement phase
so what what client will do uh
in this particular phase right we will
take an example of a
real world software application and then
we try to understand that
okay so the role involved in this
particular
phase is business analyst and
the outcome of this particular phase is
business requirement specification
document
okay so that's about a requirement phase
so what is what are these requirements
right let's take one example of
inventory and billing software
right in this particular what is this
inventory and billing software i
i for example i am a company who sells
mobile phones right i want to maintain
my stock and then whenever a phone is
sold
whenever a phone is you know sold i have
to you know build that particular
customer who is buying it and then my
inventory uh you know our stock should
be reduced
that kind of you know it's a billing
software which is a
you know which is also called as point
of sale software
which is very common uh you know you
will
commonly you will see across uh you know
all the
industries right so what is this what is
this
in this the client will say i need i
want to maintain my inventory
i want to you know bill and generate the
invoice to the customer
and then not only one user multiple
users will generate the
bill at a time for example if you go to
any shopping mall
or if you're going to go to supermarket
there will not be only one
counter but multiple billing counters
will be there but the software is one
each and every billing counter one
person will be sitting and he will be
having separate
uh you know login soft separate username
and password
to that particular software to bin
right so that's the requirement and need
stock and financial reports means stock
means
okay how many are sold how many are uh
you know available in my
inventory or in my go down and then how
many uh
not today how much money i have
generated
it might be a daily basis it might be
monthly basis or yearly basis whatever
date the customer selects
you should be able to generally generate
the financial reports also
okay so this is the requirement is given
by the customer
uh to the business unless okay
we will go in each and every phase we
will take
this inventory and billing software and
we'll try to analyze
right how exactly you know a software
will be filled the next phase is
analysis phase
okay the requirement is given by the
client
but whether it is feasible to develop
all the requirements given by the
customer or client or not
that analysis will be done okay analysis
and
feasibility study of the requirement is
done
not every requirement will be you know
converted into a software
there will be there will be uh you know
some restrictions also
right while developing the software
because customer
on his day-to-day basis whatever he does
in his uh you know a store
or in his supermarket or wherever it is
he is going to
explain that to the business analyst but
not all the you know requirements
can be we can always fulfill all the
requirements or
there might be some restrictions in
fulfilling all the requirements so
we have to do a feasibility study of all
the requirements
right and we have to analyze the
requirement and we have to do
feasibility study of the
requirement once that is done so who
are all going to you know do this
particular
feasibility study so you can see here
business analyst because he is the
person
who has uh who is interacting with the
customer so business analyst and then
the project managers right so these
these people are uh
you know from the development team and
then different team leads
and it it all depends on the company but
these are the main
uh you know roles which will always be
involved in
analyzing the requirements once they
analyze the requirements so they will
they will filter out okay i can i can we
can
develop this particular software for
these requirements
right a detailed software requirement
are documented so whatever orally
uh the requirements given by the client
it is it
it will it will not be you know properly
you know designed uh
to develop a software so there will be a
document which
which is generated which is called
software requirement specification
document
by these people right so in this phase
uh what happens we are going to
write a software requirement
specification document along with
analyzing the and of doing the
feasibility study of the requirement
so the outcome is software requirement
specification document so what is this
software
you can see here this is how the
software requirement specification uh
you know
will be detailed out for a billing
software let's say
i want to have a login page and its
functionalities like username password
needs to be entered if wrong password is
entered
you know you need to show the error
message all those detailing will be
written there and then customer told
multiple users
uh you know needs to log in and build
the software so
we need to have a module we can we will
call
uh you know these things as modules
right user management
we need to have user management like add
user
update user delete user if they knew the
company they have to delete the user
right update the user if
if they have entered wrong data they
want to update the user
right well while uh adding the user you
need to create their username password
and all those things all these detailing
were not given by the client in the
requirement phase
right so these kind of detailing would
be written by the
written in the software requirement
specification document so similarly
product management
right in the product management you will
be having category and sub category
right in the in the smartphones you
might be having uh you know
in the phone industry you might be
having smartphone normal phone like that
different categories will be there and
then different company
will also needs to be added right like
that
you need to have a product management
module and then building model
and then reports module like this
everything will be
you know written in detail right that's
about
uh the analysis phase once the analysis
of
the entire requirements are done and one
software requirement specification
document
is generated they will once again you
know sit with the
customer and then they will give the
detailing about it okay this is how
uh you know the software requirements
will be filtered out these are the
software
requirements we can develop and these
are the requirements
we will not be able to develop okay so
they will they will sit in detail and
then they will come to an
agreement okay this is fine you can go
ahead and give me a design like how
exactly uh you know
the software will look on a high level
and then
give me a detailing about it and start
developing the software
so in the design phase there are two
types of design one is high level design
and low level design you can you can see
here the similarities the
same thing you if you go back and do the
construction the
there is a high level design which which
will be given uh
by the company and then in detail about
each and everything will also be
you know charted out right so similarly
in
software also we will be having high
level design
and then low level design what is this
high level design okay
i will be having uh you know user
management module like that
there will be some architecture which
will be you know
charted out there will be okay this is
the flow
and then like that the the high level
architecture will be written these are
the modules will be there
and then certain modules will interact
each other like that high level
architecture will be given that is high
level design
and in each and every module you might
be having some modules also
right so those things will all always be
you know considered in low level design
those things will always be
considered in low level design okay
or uh detailed design we will come to
this will take up an example of that
you know inventory and building software
and then
we will uh you know understand this so
what overall uh you know
will be involved in this the develop
architect
architect from the development company
okay
this this person is the main person who
is going to you know
with the help of software requirement
specification as well as business
requirement specification document
he is going to right
give the high level and low level design
documents so along with him
team leader and senior developers will
also be involved in this
okay so the outcome of this particular
phase is high level and the low level
design documents
right so we'll take up the same example
you can see here inventory and billing
software the high level architecture
would be manage inventory
billing user management reports like
this
a big module list will be given and then
how exactly they interact
each other when you go to the low level
design
right so in managed inventory managed
products will be there manage stocks
will be there manage vendors will be
there manage warehouses will be there
all right so the detailing uh you know
will be filtered out
uh to the core
right that is low level design that is
low level design that's about design
phase once the design
is shown to the developer okay this is
how the you know entire product
works sometimes what happens they are
going to
develop this with some prototypes or
some
user interfaces you will understand
about all those things
what is the user's interface means there
will not be any functionality but
you will be having okay a picture
pictorial kind of
representation will be given to the
client okay this is how it looks
right once the client accepts that or
if there are any changes he is going to
you know suggest the changes
or if once he accepts that the
development
phase will start so with the help of
requirement
as well as design documents developers
okay the input for this particular
development phase is
requirement as well as design documents
everything will be considered okay not
only design documents
you need to developers will always go
through requirement documents as well as
design documents
and then they are going to start writing
the code to develop the product
how they are going to write the code
with the help of certain coding
languages or programming languages like
c
or c plus plus right or java
or python like this many programming
languages are there
with the help of all these programming
languages
they are going to develop a software if
it might be one programming language or
it might be combination of many
programming languages
right for a big enterprise application
it will always be a combination of
multiple programming languages will be
there
so all level of developers will be
involved in this in the sense
[Music]
the senior developers junior developers
and then
team leaders sometimes team leaders may
also you know code
right all those behind in the
development phase the project managers
also in
maybe you know daily meeting or weekly
meetings they will be involved
so it is a it is a very very big phase
of software development all those phases
are
you know one or one
window and then this software
development is a very very big phase
because whatever
you have decided you need to bring it uh
you know
as a software bring the software as an
output so
a lot of lot of time will be you know
involved
time and resources will be involved in
this so the outcome of this particular
phase is source code as well as
developed product
okay so source code with source code in
the sense with the
programming languages whatever code you
are going to write that will be called
as
source code and then the final developed
product
once this particular phase is completed
right
the there will be a testing phase the
developed product is tested thoroughly
by the testing team
and ensure that the software is error
free
so like software development life cycle
we also have software testing life cycle
we will understand like what all the
different phases which are involved in
software testing life cycle
even that is a you know testing is a
part of software development life cycle
and in its own it has its own you know
systematic approach and different
methodologies will be there on different
types of testing will be there
all those things should be considered
while testing a software
so with the help of software testing
life cycle
the testing team is going to test the
developed software so what are all
overall roles which
which are involved all levels of
testosterone junior senior testers
team leads project managers or you know
test managers
all those persons will be involved in
this with an outcome
quality product and test artifacts so
test artifacts means lot of
documentation
documents will be you know generated in
this particular software
testing life cycle in this test strategy
will be there
test plan document will be there and uh
you know to test the product
they will be having a systematic a
step-by-step test
case will be there right so and then
the what if you find some errors or bugs
that bug reports will be there all those
are called test artifacts lot of
documents will be the
output of this particular phase once the
testing is complete
right and test one's test management
team
gives a go ahead for the product to you
know
release to the customer that particular
product will be you know deployed or
will be
installed in the customer environment in
the development
phase development there will be a
development environment
in the testing phase there will be a
testing environment
and the customer environment will be the
production environment
this will be the production environment
okay so that is called deployment phase
once everything is done after testing
team
sign off the product is deployed or
installed in the customer environment
for the end user
so who are all involved in this
particular deployment phase
deployment engineers there will be
separate deployment engineers will be
there
they are going to deploy the product in
the customer's environment
so what is the outcome of this phase
ready to use product in production
environment
ready to use product in customer or
production
environment the customer environment
where we have deployed the software is
called
production environment so the last phase
is
maintenance phase right even in
production environment we might start
getting some errors or issues
and those needs to be addressed and
resolved it is not that you know
after doing so much of testing and
development and everything the
end product will be you know 100 error
free
that that will not never be the case uh
you know for
in any software development so whatever
errors you find in the production
environment
those errors needs to be you know
resolved
or there will be you know some new
change or enhancement request so
initially the customer for this
inventory and billing software he might
have told ok
i have only one branch but multiple
uh you know users will be there now
after six months he will say hey i am
starting one more branch
the entire you know for that branch the
entire
inventory and then billing and
everything should be different
but the software whatever you are going
to
you know give me should be an integrated
one
in the sense everything should be in one
place i i
i should be able to see everything uh in
my hand in a sense all the reports and
everything of that branch also so for
that what you need to do
this is a new new change request or new
it's
it's also called as enhancement request
so you need to add one more module
called branch model
where you need to create one branch
right there is a main branch and then
branch two and then in that for that
branch you need to start adding the
users and then the stock and all those
things
so these kind of requirements might also
come in the
maintenance phase so how exactly this
maintenance will be done
there will be a service level agreements
between customer you know customer
as well as the development company and
then based on those agreements they are
going to
resolve the issues and then if there are
any new changes
right they will they will agree that
okay
i will give you maintenance for two
years for this amount
anything i ask you should be able to do
it or
the agreements can be any type
right so in this particular maintenance
phase production support engineers
developers and testers all these three
people will be involved
if there are any new changes or requests
those changes needs to be you know first
discussed with the production support
engineers and then it will be passed to
the developers developers will develop
those things and then
it will be tested and then again it will
be deployed
right if there are any errors or issues
sometimes production support engineers
can also you know fix those
issues or errors or if the customers
have any queries related to any module
or anything
will also be you know addressed by these
production support engineers
so this is the you know maintenance
phase in the sense after
completing the development you need to
you know maintain the software for
you know n number of years for
n number of years because it is not that
one year they will use
you know stop it they might uh you know
use it for many years with
many you know new requirements or many
users
or any any requirement come for that
matter right
so it is also you know very very
important phase in
software development life cycle
that's about the entire you know the
phases whatever we have discussed here
all these different phases right and
their detailed
uh overview what what happens in each
and every phase and then who are all
will be involved
in each and every phase of that
particular software development life
cycle
so in this particular software
development life cycle we have different
models
okay so models are nothing but different
approaches right for a small software
what needs to be the approach for a big
software what needs to be the approach
or for an
enterprise software what needs to be the
approach right
so there are different different you
know approaches or models are there
which are now very standard and commonly
used in the industry
the first one is waterfall model
iterative model prototype model
rapid application development spiral
model v
model and agile methodology so these are
all
you know very very important models
which we have
used and then this is a traditional
model but agile methodology is the you
know
model which is used currently in the
market
so we will see all the important you
know
sdlc models in our upcoming videos
so that's about a software development
lifecycle
so if you like this video i think i i
have taken
you know with lot of examples i have
explained the software development life
cycle because
this is the fundamental for any
developer or
any tester who wants to come to software
industry
right you need to know in detail about
it that's why i have taken uh you know
this particular
video a bit long with lot of examples
and a lot of explanation
if you like this video please you know
subscribe to our channel as well as we
are present in all these different
uh platforms like we have a youtube
channel we have a
facebook page we have our own website
and then we have facebook group
you can you know follow us on all these
platforms in each and every platform we
will come up with
uh you know new stuff stuff about
the software the technology and then if
there are any you know job openings
which needs to be referred that also be
you know taken
posted in our facebook pages as well as
facebook group
so please do follow us in all these
platforms
thank you so much for watching
