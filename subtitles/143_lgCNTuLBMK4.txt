Hi my name is Will and i'm going to give  
you a step-by-step guide to the 
data analysis process, let's go!
in this video we're going to go through the five 
key stages of the data analysis process we're  
going to give you an overview and an introduction 
to each of these stages as well as looking at some  
of the tools you'll use to undertake these stages 
so let's dive into step one defining the question  
the first step in your data analysis process 
or any data analysis process is to define your  
objective in data analytics terms this is called 
the problem statement defining your objective  
means coming up with a hypothesis and figuring 
out how exactly to test it you can start by asking  
what business problem am i trying to solve now i 
know this might sound straightforward but it can  
actually be trickier than it seems for instance 
your organization's senior management might pose a  
question such as why are we losing customers it's 
possible though that this doesn't get to the core  
of the problem a data analyst job is to understand 
the business and the business's goals as a data  
analyst you need to understand this in enough 
depth that they can frame the problem the right  
way to give you a practical example let's say you 
work for a fictional company for example we'll  
call it top notch learning this fictional company 
top notch creates custom training software for its  
clients in this example top notch is excellent 
at securing new clients but unfortunately top  
notch has much lower repeat business as such as a 
data analyst your question might not be why are we  
losing customers but which factors are negatively 
impacting the customer experience or even better  
yet how can we boost customer retention whilst 
minimizing costs now you've identified the problem  
you need to find which data is going to help 
you solve this issue this is where your business  
acronym comes in again for instance perhaps 
you've noticed that the sales pipeline for new  
customers is very slick but the production team 
is extremely inefficient knowing this you could  
hypothesize the sales process actually wins a lot 
of new clients but the customer experience well  
it's kind of lacking could this be the reason that 
customers aren't coming back what sources of data  
will help you answer this question as a data 
analyst considering all these things will help  
you define the question and help you solve the 
problem at hand there's also a number of tools  
that can help you define your objective defining 
your objective is mostly about soft skills so  
business knowledge and lateral thinking but you'll 
also need to consider business metrics and key  
performance indicators and these are called KPIs 
monthly reports can help you track problem points  
in the business there are lots of tools out there 
on the market that can analyze this business data  
tools like Databox and DashaRoo there's also free 
open source software like Grafana freeboard and  
Dashbuilder these are fantastic for producing 
simple dashboards both at the beginning and at  
the end of the data analysis process so that was 
step one defining the objective onto step two step  
two collecting the data once you've established 
your objective you'll need to create a strategy  
for collecting and aggregating the appropriate 
data a key part of this is determining which  
data you need this might be quantitative data or 
numeric data eg sales figures or monthly reports  
or qualitative descriptive data such as customer 
reviews all of this data fits into one of three  
categories first party second party and third 
party data let's explore each one briefly now  
what is first party data first party data is data 
that you or your company has directly collected  
from customers it might for example come in the 
form of transactional tracking data or information  
from your customer relationship management 
system your CRM system whatever it source  
first party data is usually collected in a clear 
and structured way other sources of first party  
data might include customer satisfaction surveys 
focus groups interviews or direct observation  
let's talk about second party data to enrich your 
analysis you might want to secure a secondary data  
source second party data is simply the first 
party data of other organizations this might  
be available directly from the company or from 
private marketplace the main benefit of second  
party data is that it's usually structured 
and although it's less relevant than first  
party data it tends to be reliable examples of 
second party data include website app or social  
media activity like online purchase history or 
shipping data so lastly what is third-party data  
third-party data is data that has been collected 
and aggregated from numerous sources from a third  
party often but not always third-party data 
contains a lot of unstructured data or big data  
many organizations collect this big data to create 
industry reports or to conduct market research the  
research and advisory firm Gartner is a good real 
world example of an organization that collects big  
data and then sells it on to other companies open 
data repositories and government portals are also  
sources of third third-party data let's take 
a moment to look at some of the tools that you  
can use to collect data once you've devised this 
data strategy ie you've identified what data you  
need and how best to go about collecting it there 
are many tools that you can use to help you one  
thing you'll need regardless of industry or area 
of expertise is a data management platform or DMP  
a DMP is a piece of software which allows you to 
identify and aggregate data from numerous sources  
before they're manipulating them segmenting them 
and so on there are many DMPs available some  
well-known enterprise DMPs include salesforce DMP, 
SAAS and the data integration platform Xplenty if  
you want to play around you can also try some open 
source platforms like Pymcore or Dswarm on to step  
three cleaning the data once you've collected your 
data the next step is to get it ready for analysis  
this means cleaning or scrubbing it and this is 
crucial to make sure that you're working with  
high quality data key data cleaning tasks include 
removing major errors duplicates or outliers all  
of which are problems when you aggregate data 
from numerous sources removing unwanted data  
points so extracting irrelevant observations that 
have no bearing on your intended analysis bringing  
structure to your data or general housekeeping 
so for example fixing typos or layout issues  
which will help you map or manipulate your data 
more easily and finally it helps filling in major  
gaps as you're tidying up you might notice that 
important data is missing once you've identified  
these gaps you can go about filling them a good 
data analyst will spend about 70 to 90 of their  
time cleaning data this might sound excessive but 
focusing on the wrong data or analyzing error in  
this data will severely impact your results it 
might even send you back to square one so whatever  
you do don't rush this step let's have a look 
at some of the tools that you can use to clean  
your data cleaning data manually especially large 
data sets can be incredibly daunting but luckily  
there are many tools available to streamline this 
process open source tools such as open refine are  
excellent for basic data cleaning as well as high 
level exploration however free tools offer limited  
functionality for very large data sets now i know 
this sounds like a data zoo but python libraries  
such as pandas and some r packages are better 
suited to heavy data scrubbing you will of course  
need to be savvy with languages alternatively 
enterprise tools are also available for example  
data ladder which is one of the highest rated data 
matching tools in the industry there are many more  
why don't you see which data cleaning tools you 
can find online share your free tools in the  
comments below so that was step three cleaning 
the data on to step four analyzing that data  
finally once you've cleaned your data now comes 
the fun bit analyzing it the type of data analysis  
you conduct largely depends on what your goal is 
but there are many techniques available univariate  
or bivariate analysis time series analysis and 
regression analysis are just a few you might  
have heard of more important than the different 
types though is how you apply them this depends  
on what types of insights you're hoping to gain 
broadly speaking all types of data analysis fit  
into the four following categories descriptive 
analysis which is analysis which identifies what  
has already happened this is a common first step 
that companies do before proceeding with deeper  
explorations diagnostic analysis where the focus 
is on understanding why something has happened  
it is literally the diagnosis of a problem just 
as a doctor uses the symptoms to diagnose the  
patient's disease predictive analysis which is 
where you identify future trends by the analysis  
of historical data predictive analysis is commonly 
used by businesses to forecast future growth and  
lastly prescriptive analysis which allows 
you to make recommendations for the future  
this is the final step in the analytics part 
of the process but it's also the most complex  
this is because it incorporates aspects of all 
the other analyses that we've described today  
step 5 sharing your results you've finished 
carrying out your analyses you have your insights  
the final step of a data analysis process is to 
share these insights with the wider world or at  
least with your organization's stakeholders this 
is actually more complex than just sharing the raw  
results of your work it involves interpreting the 
outcomes and presenting them in a manner which is  
digestible to everybody that's in the room since 
you'll also present your work to decision makers  
it's very important that the insights that you 
share are 100 clear and also unambiguous for  
this reason data analysts usually use reports 
dashboards and interactive visualizations to  
support their findings how you interpret and 
present results will often influence the direction  
of the business depending on what you share 
your organization might decide to restructure to  
launch a new product or close an entire division 
that's why it's very important to present all the  
evidence that you gathered and not to cherry-pick 
data ensuring that you cover everything in a clear  
and concise way will prove that your conclusions 
are scientifically sound and based on facts on the  
flip side it's important to highlight any gaps 
in the data or to flag any insights that might  
be open to interpretation remember that honest 
communication is an important part of the process  
it will help the business but it will also help 
you to excel at your job there's a ton of tools  
for interpreting and sharing your findings these 
tools are suited to different experience levels  
but popular tools that require no coding skills 
include Google Charts, Tableau, Datawrapper and  
Infogram if you're familiar with python and 
r there are also many data visualization  
libraries and packages available for instance 
check out the Python libraries Plotty, Seaborn  
and Matplotlib whichever data visualization 
tools you use make sure that you polish up your  
presentation skills too visualization is great 
but communication is key so hopefully now you  
have a better idea of the data analysis process
