cloud computing is a term that refers to
the ability to access everything
remotely on the internet instead of
locally on your devices
everything you use like mail music and
video streaming apps all have data that
needs to be stored somewhere that
somewhere is really just a Global
Network of computer clusters and servers
but the network of computer clusters
doesn't quite have a ring to it so we'll
just call it the cloud
here's a relatable example to help you
understand
all of you are watching YouTube on some
type of device with most of you on your
phones and computers but even someone
tablets and TVs how many videos have you
watched today and more importantly how
many of my videos have you watched
if you've watched them all first of all
thank you but secondly this means you've
watched about four gigabytes worth of
content
without cloud computing you would have
to store these four gigabytes on your
local device just to be able to watch
them combine that with everything else
you watch on YouTube and your device
would be full in no time thankfully
YouTube has cloud-based storage which
means that my four gigabytes of videos
are stored somewhere far away in a large
and expensive cluster of computers and
put on display to the internet YouTube
stores these videos so you don't have to
cloud computing isn't a single piece of
technology instead it's a system which
is made up of three main types of
services
software platform and infrastructure
software as a service represents online
software applications that manage every
service for you
Dropbox is a great example of this all
you have to do is purchase the software
and you can start uploading to the cloud
Dropbox handles everything
platform as a service providers manage
pretty much everything but allow you to
handle the applications and data
this makes it primarily used as a
platform for software development
Heroku is the perfect example here
developers are able to host their
applications on the cloud without need
to worry about anything except the
development of the application
lastly infrastructure as a service is
used when you want more flexibility than
platform as a service and want to handle
the middleware and operating system
components as well
Some Cloud providers only offer one of
these three services but larger Cloud
Computing Services like Google Cloud
Amazon web services and Microsoft Azure
offer options for all three types of
services this has been cloud computing
