looking for gold in a mine of
information
data mining can help
[Music]
like how mining for gold is digging
through earth and rock for the valuable
bits
data mining is sorting through large
data sets to find the valuable
information
the process of data mining involves
using software algorithms and
statistical methods
to identify patterns and data to help
answer business questions
and predict future trends and behavior
data mining techniques are used in
business areas like marketing
risk management fraud detection
cybersecurity medical diagnosis and
mathematics
and research disciplines like
cybernetics and genetics
data mining is a means to drive
increased efficiency in business
operations
but it can also set a business apart
from the competition in combination with
predictive analytics
machine learning and other aspects of
advanced analytics

data mining is sometimes used
interchangeably with data analytics
but it's really a component of the
overall data science and analytics
process
data mining focuses on finding relevant
information and data sets
which can then be used for analytics and
predictive modeling
there are five primary steps to data
mining identification of business issues
to analyze data sources
such as databases or operational systems
data collection and exploration
including the sampling and profiling of
data sets
data preparation and transformation to
filter
cleanse and structure data for analysis
modeling in which data scientists and
other users create
test and evaluate data mining models
and deployment of the models for
analytics use cases
in general data mining uncovers hidden
patterns and relationships and data
that can ultimately impact business
across all industries
for example using data mining businesses
can improve
lead conversion rates in sales and
marketing build risk models
and detect fraud in finance and improve
safety
identify quality issues and manage
supply chain operations and
manufacturing
