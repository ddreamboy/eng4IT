from the day i started messing around with 
some data in Excel it took me about three  
years to land a data analyst job at Heineken and 
another two years to land a job as a freelance  
data analyst at a big bank in Europe and another 
two years to quit that job and travel the world  
full-time but more on that later can you become 
a data analyst way faster? 100% i've wasted too  
many hours watching youtube tutorials and i've 
spent money on Udemy courses that didn't add  
any value so i often ask myself if i could start 
over with data analysis knowing what i know today  
how would i go about it? and that's exactly what 
this video is about i'll remove all the fluff and  
give you the fastest path to go from zero to 
a full-time data analyst and throughout this  
video i will share the three major mistakes almost 
every data analyst makes so stay tuned for those  
the first thing every beginner data analyst needs 
to pick is a tool or programming language for data  
analysis i personally started off with Excel is 
that the best tool there is for data analysis no  
if i could go back in time would have started 
with something else also no because apparently  
getting good at Excel was enough for my first 
data analysis job and i personally recommend  
every single data analyst to start off with 
Excel it's easy to learn used in almost every  
company and it has a wide range of applications 
for data analysis but this is also it's pitfall  
although you can do a lot of different things 
in Excel it's not designed specifically for  
data analysis meaning it has its limitations 
you want to work with a very large data set  
well good luck not punching through your computer 
screen after Excel crashes for the 27th time  
Excel is perfect for starting out but once 
you've mastered excel it's time to move on  
to the more serious tools and the most logical 
tool to learn next is SQL next to Excel it is  
apparently the second most requested skill in data 
analyst job openings huge thanks to Luke Barousse  
for actually scraping a lot of Linkedin 
job openings to come up with these facts  
you're a legend man thank you what up that nerds 
and the reason SQL is so in demand is because  
it doesn't have the same limitations as Excel 
why is my accent suddenly changing to southern  
i don't know what with SQL you can extract 
transform and load very large data sets but  
the best thing about it is that SQL has its own 
very easy to use programming language it's a great  
tool to add to your skill set as a data analyst 
while also being a great stepping stone to some  
more serious programming but before we get to 
that every data analyst needs a visualization  
tool there are dozens of BI tools out there but 
having worked for multiple companies and projects  
and having looked at probably hundreds of data 
analyst job openings i've come to realize that  
the majority of companies are looking for people 
with experience with Tableau Power BI and Qlikview  
here's the pros and cons of each so you can decide 
which suits you best Power BI is part of the  
Microsoft stack so it works smoothly with Excel 
and Sharepoint besides that it has a free version  
and even the paid versions are relatively budget 
friendly compared to the other BI tools next up is  
Tableau Tableau is a BI tool with more extensive 
data visualization capabilities than Power BI  
it seems to be just a bit more in demand in 
the job market than Power BI it comes with  
a much higher price tag though making it harder 
to learn if you're starting out by yourself and  
then there's Qlikview using in-memory technology 
making it a super fast and responsive way of doing  
business intelligence but also a pretty high price 
tag and also it's less in demand than Tableau and  
Power BI i personally picked Power BI as my BI 
tool although it might not be the fastest BI tool  
out there or the one with the most extensive 
capabilities in my opinion it can give you  
the most bang for buck when it comes to becoming a 
full-time data analyst before we move on to how to  
actually get good at data analysis and land that 
first job there's one more thing we need to do  
as a data analyst after you've mastered a BI tool 
it's time to get into the more advanced analytics  
i'm talking about which programming language 
to use when it comes to data analysis or data  
science software developers and programmers get to 
choose between java javascript ruby c-sharp python  
r c c++ and many more luckily for us data analysts 
we only have to choose between two programming  
languages r and python so which one should you 
pick i chose python but if i could go back in  
time i would choose python why well even though 
they're actually very similar r is a programming  
language focused more on statistical analysis 
well python is a more general purpose programming  
language that also happens to be very good for 
data analysis and although r might be a little  
bit easier to learn i would still go for python as 
it's the probably probably probably the number one  
programming language in the world meaning if you 
get good at python for data analysis it might also  
open the door to a lot of different job 
opportunities so the path i took is Excel  
SQL Power BI and Python this is the path i would 
recommend as it worked out great for me but you  
can start off with any language or tool that 
suits you best because whatever you pick your  
first language or tool will definitely not be your 
last so now that you know which tools to learn  
let's talk about how to actually learn it and 
this is where beginners make the first major  
mistake the mistake most beginners make is that 
they try to learn by watching others this is how  
most people learn data analysis some people go to 
Udemy and watch multiple 20 plus hour courses and  
probably not even finish all of them or they watch 
youtube videos watching other people analyze data  
but without actually writing code or analyzing 
data themselves they give themselves a false  
sense of progress because analyzing data in your 
head is very different than from actually doing it
data analysis in your head is very different 
from actually analyzing data stumbling upon  
faulty data and debugging for hours so what is 
the right way to do it? the answer is very simple:  
learn by doing you just need to get the 
reps in and start coding and analyzing  
data by yourself for Excel i would recommend 
a website called www.excel-practice-online.com  
a free website where you learn to use Excel 
by doing from the basics to the most advanced  
functionalities for SQL i would recommend the 
website www.w3schools.com/sql for Power BI i  
would recommend Datacamp there's free courses 
and also paid ones for python you can go to  
this free website called learnpython.org whether 
you're practicing every day at your current job  
so you can make that switch to a data analysis 
career or whether you're still studying you need  
to practice every single day only this way will 
you experience what it's actually like working as  
a data analyst analysis working as a data analyst 
only then will you learn what it's like to debug  
your own code or formulas because to be honest 
that's what you will spend the most time on  
debugging faulty code or correcting faulty data 
being a data analyst is awesome but this is also  
the second major mistake most beginners make they 
try to solve every problem themselves the fact is  
that error you just got in Power BI there's a very 
big chance someone already has experienced exactly  
the same error as you and that's good news for you 
because now you don't have to look for the cause  
of the error you just have to copy part of the 
error message in google and you probably end up on  
some stack overflow website where someone explains 
exactly how to solve this error let's be honest  
copying code from stack overflow is like 80% 
of any developer programmer or data analyst job  
data analyst is awesome okay now that you know 
what tool and programming language to pick  
and how to actually learn it it's time to build 
your portfolio and this will help you build  
out an attractive CV for recruiters on Linkedin 
recruiters i always talk like a bit this i know  
programmer so strange programming language 
and recruiters talk to me every day now if  
you have a job where you can apply data analytics 
already then do so right away if you don't really  
do anything data analytics related like sales for 
example then try to build a report or a dashboard  
showing some key metrics or KPI's that you 
can show to your manager he will appreciate  
it and you will get to learn your data analysis 
skills and if you can't apply to your current job  
or if you're still studying then start a project 
on your own at home because in the end it's about  
getting that data analyst job and the best way 
to do that is as follows pimp up your Linkedin  
profile i've made a video before where i give 
my top five Linkedin profile tips to attract  
recruiters on Linkedin and i'll summarize it here 
for you make sure you put data analysts in as many  
places as you can in your profile Linkedin is a 
search engine and if recruiters search for data  
analysts you want to be found you want to be on 
top of that list so make sure your header contains  
the word data analyst in your work experience 
if you've done something data analyst related  
put in the keyword data analyst once your Linkedin 
profile is set up there's two things you can do  
start applying to every single data analyst 
job you can find on Linkedin or any other job  
platform or the second way which i prefer is if 
you've set up your Linkedin profile correctly  
then recruiters will soon start hunting you they 
will invite you to job interviews for data analyst  
positions which brings me to major mistake number 
three don't quit well do quit let me explain you  
see the second best decision i have ever made 
in my life was becoming a data analyst and to  
become one yourself the only thing you have to do 
is don't quit whether it will take you one week  
one month or one year if you keep applying if you 
keep improving your skills updating your CV you  
will land that job eventually and trust me once 
you do land that first data analyst job a world  
of opportunities will open up for you you can grow 
your skills into a senior data analyst or become  
a freelance data analyst or what i eventually 
did quit my job as a data analyst the single  
best decision in my life was quitting my job 
as a data analyst you see becoming a freelance  
data analyst gave me the resources to quit my 
job and pursue a completely different career  
creating my own brand while traveling the world 
do not subscribe to my youtube channel i'm 100%  
serious if you're looking for advice and tips on 
how to become a data analyst and how to build a  
data analyst career for the rest of your life then 
i would recommend subscribing to Luke Barousse  
what up nerds as he makes way better videos than 
me but if you view being a data analyst as a  
stepping stone to creating a life you want your 
dream life whatever that might be for you then  
you might want to subscribe as i share my personal 
lessons on this journey from a 9-5 to a dream life  
watch this video next to learn what made me 
quit my six-figure job to start youtube cheers
