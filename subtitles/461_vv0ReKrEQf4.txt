hi everyone this is an introduction to
data warehousing video
we will understand what a data warehouse
is
talk about a standard data warehouse
architecture and finally discuss
benefits challenges in future
so let's get started
what is a data warehouse
a data warehouse is a system that
integrates data from multiple
different kinds of systems for business
use
a data warehouse typically stores data
in dimensional form which is
denormalized
what is a dimension it's a data modeling
approach that comprises of facts table
at the center along with set of
dimensional tables
as its lookup tables
for more knowledge on the subject i will
cover it in the data modeling series
stay tuned
this doesn't mean a data warehouse
cannot be normalized one yes it can but
it is a less popular option
and also beats the purpose
a data warehouse is mostly used for
analytics reporting and business
intelligence
and finally the key difference between a
transactional system
and data warehouse is
that a data warehouse maintains history
data
this is a very powerful use of it as
well
before we begin talking about how a
generic data warehouse architecture
looks like
having basic understanding of various
types of data stores like olap oltp data
mart etc
would allow you to follow this video
easily
hence i recommend you check out my other
quick and short video on types of data
stores in this very series
even otherwise you should be able to
follow this video without any issues
so let's start discussing
what all types of source systems can
input data into a data warehouse
we can have oltp systems
ods
and even data warehouse yes a data
warehouse can send data to another data
warehouse
in addition
there can be raw files directly inputted
as well as data coming from outside the
organization which is external source
now typically a staging area also known
as a stage is a landing zone for a data
warehouse
it should ideally maintain the exact
same copy as a source system
major advantage of doing this is if
there is a data issue
one can refer to stage to understand
what data was sent by the source without
having to engage multiple stakeholders
again and again
data in this stage is extracted and
loaded by etl processes
please note that the transformation
usually doesn't happen at this layer
if you would like to know more about etl
design patterns and how the extraction
and loading takes place do check out my
other video titled 10 etl design
patterns in this very series
now etl is used again this time with
transformations to load data from stage
into either a normalized data store a
dimensional data store or data mart most
widely it's a dimensional data store
a dimensional data store is a result of
dimensional modeling done using
facts and dimensions
which is gimbal methodology i will be
covering this in detail in my data
modeling series so
please subscribe the channel to stay
updated
this is essentially a data warehouse
and finally we have a consumption layer
in the data warehouse which is
what a data warehouse outputs
it can create an olap system for
analytical or reporting purposes
send data to another data warehouse
using extracts or db connections it can
provide materialized view
to business users for quick querying of
data for a day
to day use and finally it can create a
multi-dimensional database also known as
a cube for analytical or business
intelligence purposes
so what is data warehousing
in simple terms it's the process to
build a data warehouse
where exactly does it fit into this
picture
right here
all these layers are a result of data
warehousing
we will now understand what all actions
are performed at every layer during data
warehousing
first layer is source to stage
the action here is also known as data
sourcing
data transformation is usually performed
in the second layer
it can also be performed before loading
to consumption layer if there is a need
for it
while i have limited the conversation to
three layers since there is a generic
this is a generic architecture mostly
the data warehouse stores represented by
nds dds and data mart can have many more
layers within
next if we combine the first two layers
action performed here are data
consolidation and data mapping
a data mapping is performed between
source fields and target data warehouse
fields using business rules and
transformations required to meet them
are also documented in a mapping
document
at the final layer data provisioning is
done for the information to be
effectively consumed
and finally data integration
extraction
load
data quality checks
data auditing
and metadata capture or management is
also performed in almost
all layers of a typical data warehouse
now we will be covering benefits that a
data warehouse brings on the table as
well as challenges
a data warehouse is usually a single
stop shop for business looking for data
hence
users have quicker access to data and
information as opposed to reaching out
to multiple sources to get the required
information
this aids in
faster and more informed decision making
hence improved return on investment
the data store in data warehouse
undergoes various data cleaning
exercises as well as data quality checks
this makes data more usable
finally a major difference between an
oltp system and data warehouse is the
storage of history data in the latter
this enables analytics for data over a
period of time and hence effective
insights
and now challenges
a data within a data warehouse can only
be as good as its sources this is
because a data warehouse doesn't capture
or update any data for customers
so if the quality of data is bad in its
source
the same will reflect in the data
warehouse
another challenge is that data is loaded
from multiple diverse sources at times
it can have similar kind of data this
often leads to data inconsistencies
so what's the future of data warehousing
will data lakes be replacing it the
short answer is no
data warehouse and data lakes will
continue to coexist in organizations in
fact they will complement each other
what is a data lake i will be explaining
the same in my big data series
next
data warehousing automation is trending
it is basically an automated way of
building a data warehouse
and
covering all steps in its lifecycle
using best practices
another upcoming field is cloud data
warehousing which involves building a
data warehouse as a managed service on
cloud
