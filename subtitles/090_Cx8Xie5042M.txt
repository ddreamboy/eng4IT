hello everyone this is waseem from
edureka and i welcome you all to the
session in which i am going to perform
predictive analysis
so let's take a look at the agenda for
this session first of all i'm going to
begin with the basic introduction to
predictive analysis
followed by a few applications moving
further i will discuss the steps
involved in predictive analysis
and finally i will perform predictive
analysis on a data set
using python i hope you guys are clear
with the agenda
also don't forget to subscribe to
edureka for more exciting tutorials
and press the bell icon to get the
latest updates on edureka
and to check out edireca's machine
learning certification program
the link is given in the description box
below now without any further ado
let us understand what exactly
predictive analysis is
so what is predictive analysis
predictive analytics or analysis
encompasses a variety of statistical
techniques from data mining
predictive modeling and machine learning
that actually analyze the current and
historical facts
to make predictions about future or
otherwise unknown events
so this is the basic definition from
wikipedia so we basically use the
previously collected data
to predict an outcome or an event so
typically
historical data is used to build a
mathematical model
in our case we can call it a classifier
or a predictive model or a regressor
which actually captures the important
trends and then the current
data is used on that model to predict
what will happen next
or to suggest actions to take optimal
outcomes
so let us take a look at various
applications where we can actually use
predictive analysis
so we can use predictive analysis for a
lot of things
first of all we have campaign management
so let's say we have a campaign we have
to figure out what kind of
audience will be there or what kind of
our target audience is
so we can analyze the previous data of
our previous campaigns
that we might have managed previously
and according to that we can
figure out some suggestions or you know
the course of action that we have to
take
but this is one campaign management that
we can do using the predictive analysis
or for recent examples let's say an
election campaign you know a lot of
people
are gathering a lot of data of previous
elections like how it
happened and what are the major factors
that led to the winning of some so and
so person
so this is how we can use predictive
analysis in campaign management
then there is customer accusation so we
can analyze the whole business
and we can figure out different points
to you know figure out what kind of
tasks or events we can actually produce
in order to
make our business better so that we'll
be able to make customer acquisition
better
and then we have budgeting and
forecasting as well similarly you know
taking a look at previous data we can
finalize some budget and forecast
few uh related pointers for example we
have stock prediction
using python or any other language such
as r also
and then we have fraud detection so we
can you know manage a lot of data
like for credit card companies they make
use of hundreds and hundreds of users
and they analyze the data to predict or
you know detect the fraudulent
transactions in their data
and then there is promotions as well so
we can analyze you know the target
audience
we can uh follow the trends like they
are following you know the types of
content they're actually going for and
then similarly you can make promotions
according to that
and there is pricing also like you can
figure out let's say you have a
supermarket somewhat like you know what
walmart does
so you have all the pricing and
everything so what you can do is
figure out the price of a product after
several time based on the recent
purchases
and also the recent scenario or the
previous historical data
upon which the price has been
distributed accordingly
and you can also plan for the demand as
well using the predictive analysis
so these are a few applications that i
can think of right now and
these are only a few applications where
you can use predictive analysis
to predict the for example i'll talk
about football guys
so let's say if you have a favorite
player and in the next season you want
to see how much price
he might go for in certain other clubs
so you can make use of the data at your
bay
and depending on the purchases that
happen in previous seasons
or the windows you can actually figure
out somewhat around what kind of price
your favorite player is gonna go for so
that is one example i can think of right
now so these are a few applications of
predictive analysis
now let's move on to the next topic of
the session guys which is
steps involved in predictive analysis so
this is a very important concept in this
session guys
so you have to fully understand what
kind of steps that goes in while you're
doing a predictive analysis
so the first step has to be a data
exploration so what you have to do is
gather data
uploaded into your program then you have
to take a look at your data in
a perspective which will clear certain
things for you like you have to
figure out what kind of data you're
dealing with what are the columns what
are the features that you have inside
your data
what kind of data it is how many
numerical values are there what kind of
data types are there inside your data
is it a csv file or not so on so you
have to figure out a lot
of things while data exploration and
after that you can
figure out how to clean your data by
cleaning i mean
you have to figure out the redundancies
that might hinder your model so for that
you have to check for
null values you have to check for
missing values and then you have to
figure out what kind of
columns will be actually better if you
put them inside your model
and what are the redundant variables
like what kind of columns that you can
actually remove and will not make a
difference in your mod
so that covers the data cleaning part
and then there is modeling where you
have to model your
or you have to select your predictive
model guys so
there are a lot of models that you can
go for but in this session i'm going to
use the linear regression model because
it's the very simple or the basic one
so that the beginners also will be able
to learn it properly
after modeling you have to check for the
evaluation or you have to check for the
accuracy you know how your model is
actually performing
so let's talk about these steps in a
little more detailed way
so we'll talk about data exploration
first of all as i've already told you
data exploration is
gathering your data and then taking a
look at your data
in a perspective that will clear a lot
of things for example you will be able
to see
the number of columns number of rows you
will have
a description of all the data types what
kind of variables are there you will
have the mean values the average values
minimum values
and you can also check for unique values
in your columns as well
so this all comes in data exploration
and after this
the second step is data cleaning and
i've already told you guys data cleaning
is basically getting rid of
redundancies in your data which includes
the missing values which may hinder
and you have to make sure that your
model is not going to cause overfitting
or underfitting
due to the noise and noise is basically
irrelevant data that
may be in the form of null values so you
have to make sure you get rid of them or
replace them with average values in the
column
and then there is redundancies like
outliers which are not necessarily
required in your model so you can remove
them as well so this is all about data
cleaning
and then we have the third step which is
modeling so for data modeling first of
all you have to understand the
relationship between the variables in
your model so that
you will figure out what kind of model
you are going to go for
so for example if let's say if you have
a target variable in our case which will
be a price of
certain goods so let's say you have to
figure out the relationship between
variables so if you're going for linear
regression you have to make sure
the relationship is continuous and let's
say if you are
going for logistic regression it is
important that you go for
continuous variables the target variable
although has to be
dichotomous or you know what you call it
categorical which is like let's say
if i'm trying to predict something using
the logistic regression the answer would
probably be yes
or no will be 1 or 0 something like that
but in case of linear regression we have
to make sure that there is some
continuous relationship between the
variables which is my target variable
and my independent variables taking a
look at the fourth part
or the fourth step and the final step is
performance analysis
so after you're done making a model so
you have to perform certain analysis
which is you know checking the accuracy
of the model
and making sure that it's above 70. i
mean if you are a beginner
and if you are trying to make your first
prediction model anything above
70 accuracy score is very good guys
but i would suggest that if you are
working on a good model
and if you want your model to be good
the accuracy should be ranging around
0.9 which is like more than 90
and if you get it the first time it's
well and good
but it surely depends on your data and
the kind of model selection that you do
so let's take a look at the next topic
in our session guys so this is basically
where i'm going to perform predictive
analysis using python on a data set
so i have a problem statement in which i
have a data set which has
certain values or certain variables
which has columns like
you know how many bedrooms does our
house have and what kind of
square feet it is uh grabbing and all
these things that i'll show you in the
data and
using that data i am going to predict
the house of a price
so let's take it up to jupiter notebook
guys and i'll show you what i'm going to
do over there
so i have a jupyter notebook over here
guys and if you are not familiar with
jupyter notebook guys
i suggest you to check out our tutorial
on youtube we have a
jupyter notebook tutorial you will be
able to learn it properly i mean there's
not really so much to learn in jupiter
network it's quite easy that is why i'm
using also
and we have a cheat sheet as well so you
can go for that so first of all i'm
going to import some
dependencies so for the first step that
is
data exploration i have to get the data
so for that i'm going to use the
pandas library and i'll import a few
other libraries as well
like i'm going to use the c bond to
check the relationship between the
variables
basically for eda exploratory data
analysis
and if you guys don't know what eda is i
suggest you to check out another
tutorial
which is exploratory data analysis that
we have on our youtube channel
and then i'm going to import numpy as
well just in case
all right and you can see guys i have to
just press
shift and enter and this is why i'm
using a jupyter notebook because
the implementation is very easy and i
can segregate my
data or the code in different cells so
i'm importing this saw and i can just
make it okay i'll make it a little
bigger so that it's visible to you
everyone
what i can do is i can comment our part
let's say
installing
dependencies
and it is in a separate cell so that
makes it
quite descriptive when you're coding and
when you are trying to figure out what's
wrong in your code it helps actually
so after this what you have to do is
i'll check i have to import the data for
that i'm going to use the read csv
module which is basically going to go to
the file and read my data guys
the name of the file is house.csv
we have a truncated error all right so
guys i have to
show you something so usually when you
do this you when you copy the file
location you get that
unicode error but let's see if i
change these backslashes to forward
black backslashes
what happens do i still get the error or
not
okay we have a all right so i was doing
something over here
so this is one exercise for you guys
like earlier when i was
using the backward backslashes i was
getting a unicode error but when i
change it to the forward backslashes
i'm not getting that error so this is
one question for you guys tell me why
you think it happened
in the comment sections below now moving
on i'll take the first look at my data
guys so i'll just
use the head method to get my first data
so these are the first five rows in my
data guys so we i have id
we have date the price is there bedrooms
we have bathrooms square feet living
and square feet lot we have floors as
well waterfront is
zero okay it has to be zero and one i
guess
there is view then grade square feet
above so these are the
columns that i have inside my data guys
so i'll check the last five rows as well
for that i'm using the tail method
so as you can see you can get the first
look of your data using the data dot
head and data dot tail method
after that i check the
columns of my data and let's check the
shape as well guys
so that we'll know what we're dealing
with okay it's not callable
all right so we have 21 613 entries with
21 columns
okay it's a quite big data set and let
me tell you guys this is
one data set that i found on kaggle and
it's very easy to found the house data
set and i am using this example of house
data set because
it's very common and to find this data
set is very easy you go on to kegel
and you just look for house prediction
data sets
and it will show you a lot of data sites
that you can download there from
okay so you can find the data side on
kaggle guys
now we have checked the shape as well
okay i'll use one more
method that is data or describe all
right this callable all right
so we have all these numerical values
and
using the describe method we can get the
50 minimum
maximum and the standard deviation we
can get the mean value and the count as
well
so let's say for bedrooms the mean value
is three uh the most common
entry in the bedroom section is
a three bedroom house and then for
bathrooms also is a two bathroom house
square feet is almost two zero seven
nine square feet and then for maximum
values we have even a 33
bedroom house as well and we have a
house with eight bathrooms
and the square feet is thirteen thousand
five forty
all right so minimum value is we have a
zero bedroom house okay
that's gonna be something else and
square feet two ninety
so this this is how you use the describe
method and
this is the first step guys i'm trying
to do the data exploration
now after this i think i'm pretty sure
about what kind of data i'm dealing with
now what i'm going to do i'm going to
move on to the next step that is
checking for the
relationship between these variables so
for that i'm going to use the data
visualization
and i'm going to use a few i'm going to
use a few plot points
using the cbon library and if you don't
know about
c bond we have a youtube uh tutorial on
cbon library as well so you can find out
different
kinds of plots that you can use for data
visualization
and data visualization is nothing but
it's a process where you can visualize
your data
and you can try to figure out the
relationship between the variables
before that i want to check for null
values or missing values
because i don't want to get any
hindrance in my
data set where i'm modeling so first of
all you have to do
check for null values
and let's get a sum as well so we have
zero almost okay so we have no null
values in this data set
so usually if you find a null value and
if it's a big data set
and let's say if all these values are
let's say 2 000 and if you have 10
missing values you can just remove those
10 values but if there are more null
values
it's just you to replace them with the
mean value
and to find out the mean value you can
just go over here let's say if you have
uh let's say if you're checking for
bedrooms how many null values are there
and let's say
there are 500 out of 21 000. so you can
just uh replace
the zero with this value which is three
and similarly for any other column you
can do the same using the mean value
so since there are no null values inside
this data set because it's a very
uh clean data set that i downloaded it
from kaggle so we're gonna move on to
the next
step which is visualization
and mind you guys this is the step in my
data exploration part
and the data cleaning part not the other
steps that we use for predictive
analysis
all right so i have no null values but
there are a few redundancies that i want
to get rid of
i'll talk about that later guys first of
all i'm gonna use
a relation plot x i'll use
okay so i want to check or my basic
aim is to predict the price of the house
all right
so for x i'll just take
price and let's check the relationship
between these variables so i'll check
for bedroom
all right kind is equal to
okay we'll not use kind data is equal to
data okay
all right so i think
we can like almost there are so many i
mean
so this is one uh relationship that i'm
getting over here
price is not very clear but we are
getting the relationship of the bedrooms
or the most common bedroom so which is
around
over here that is zero to five
and similarly i can check for other
variables as well like bathrooms
see guys so the price is actually
increasing with the number of bathrooms
but it's not necessarily uh same for
everything
so there has to be some other
dependencies as well because as you can
see since the bathroom surprising price
is not actually
rising that much okay i'll just copy
this
for bedrooms
the price is actually increasing pretty
much with each
bedroom i mean not really if
we take a look at 10 bedrooms also the
price is pretty much the same
so this is not one decisive factor i can
think of for this
all right so we'll check for some other
as well so we'll check for square read
square feet living
so this is one linear relationship that
i'm seeing over here
so with each square feet rising
most of the prices actually in this area
only
like from 0 to 400 000 or 40 million
actually
but we can see that it's a linear
relationship with each increasing um
square
feet the price is actually rising so
this is one thing that has to be there
in
inside our train set i'll tell you what
a train set actually is
then there is floor as well we can check
for floors
all right okay so floors is actually a
pretty
descriptive over here so for most of the
values are in the two floors area and
then we can check for waterfront as well
okay we can do one thing i'll tell you
one trick
so we'll add the hue over here
this is going to be water front
so with the houses which actually has a
waterfront are in oranges
and the other ones are in blue so you
can see
the relationship between them and
similarly i can use
other okay so let's say latitude and
longitude so
you can figure out the relationship
between the variables using uh the
visualization so for me
i think in this data set to get the
price out
we're gonna have to use bedrooms
bathroom there has to be square feet
a lot of square feet has to be there
floors also we can
get and then what view front view we'll
use
square feet how we have to use and your
build and you're renovated we can leave
it out from the train set
and zip code also we don't actually need
latitude and longitude are also not
decisive in
prediction because we can use it for uh
visualization and we can actually get
the picture over there and square feet
living is actually important so
these are the redundancies that i was
talking about inside your model
so now we'll move on to the modeling
part guys
so what i'll do now is i'll import a few
dependencies guys
so from sk learn so first of all i have
to import
the linear regression from linear models
i'm going to import
linear regression all right so i'll
import the
model selection import
data split all right so first thing that
i have to do is i have to segregate my
data into a training set and a
test set so i'll do one thing guys
right so i'll get my data in this
cell
so two things that i don't actually need
inside my data are date because uh
i'll get the training data or i'll write
it as
train so which is going to be
data and i'm going to drop a few columns
so i'll have
to drop so i have to drop a
few columns so first of all i have to
drop price because it cannot be in my
training set since i'm gonna predict it
and then there has to be id we don't
actually need it
and then i'm going to drop date as well
does not really
prove a lot of things over here so for
now i'll just remove all these columns
and for our test set or the dependent
variable let's say
i'm going to take the variable as a
test let's say and for this i'm going to
use
data dot or we need actually just one
column
that is price right method objects
is not subscriptable i'm sorry i made a
syntax error over here guys
i have to add the axis as well
now it's fine guys so now what i will do
is i'll use
i'm going to segregate my data into x
train
x test y train
and y test and now i'm going to use the
train test split method so first we have
train then we have test
we have test
size which is let's say 0.3
and we have the random state is equal to
let's say 2 right so we have
made our x train and extend method now
i'll use one variable let's say
our egr regressor and now i'm going to
call my linear regression
model it's made guys so now i'm going to
use the
fit method to fit my xtrain and x y
train
data guys the training data have to fit
right we have no errors here guys
after this i can just uh okay i'll take
one variable let's say predict
and gr dot
predict x
test and y test
all right wait a second guys i'm sorry
so now the modeling part is done guys so
i'll explain what i've done over here
i took the linear model which is linear
regression
and then for segregating my data into
training and testing set i'm using the
train test split
before that i segregated the data for my
model inside which i'm using the
training
set which has all the values from the
data set except price
id and date so i have removed these
three columns because i thought these
are redundant for my model right now
and the variable that i'm going to
predict over here is
the price so i'm taking that alone so
after that i use the train test split
method to actually
separate the data into training and test
set
and then i call the linear regression
model over here
using the regression model i'm fitting
the training data
and after that i am using it to predict
the value
so now comes the part where we have to
check the efficiency of the model
so for regression models it is very easy
guys
you can just check the score for this
you have to
write a few values x test and y test
and we have the accuracy of 0.70 which
is
not bad guys if you're using the model
or the data set this big it is quite
predictable
get this kind of accuracy but you can do
something else to improve the
accuracy i mean you can look at the data
and remove all the values that you
find will help you into improving your
accuracy
like you can remove latitude longitude
you can remove zip code
you're renovated your built that you can
actually
remove water front and view as well or
keep only a few values that you actually
need which is
bedrooms bathrooms i think and
everything related to square feet
that if you keep in your training set
then it's going to be a
higher accuracy for you guys all right
so now that we are done with the section
guys i want to give you a
exercise sort of which you can do for
practicing this
so i have used the linear regression
model over here so i want you to do one
thing guys
check out other classifiers and
regressive models that you can use to
predict the value i mean we have a
tutorial on
all of them on our youtube channel and
see if you can use the same data to make
a
prediction model using other classifiers
like a random forest classifier
then we have a decision tree then you
can use the logistic regression
for this as well i mean if you have
continuous data
then you can go for linear regression
but if you find a categorical data
let's say we have waterfront or not so
you can check for that as well
