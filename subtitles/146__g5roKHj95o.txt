in this video you're going to learn all the 
fundamentals of data analysis and we'll break  
this down into four main areas first we're 
going to be looking at transforming the data  
so cleaning it up secondly we're going to be 
looking at creating descriptive statistics to  
understanding better third we're going to be 
looking at data analysis and finally we'll get  
into creating a report to visualize our findings 
so let's get into it and thank you to Coursera  
for sponsoring this video more on them later the 
first step here is to transform the data and for  
this here's the Excel file that we'll be working 
with which you can download for free in the video  
description so as you can see this is going to 
be for a fast food chain you can see the types  
of products here and the first step is simply 
to clean this up but for that we're going to  
go to control T So to change this into a table 
so change the data set into a table then we'll  
head on OK from here for the cleanup part you can 
see that under the manager column we seem to have  
some very odd spacing here so let's go ahead and 
clean that up here we're going to go to equals  
trim hit the top key and this formula is going 
to remove these old spaces I'm going to hit enter  
there you can see that's going to Auto populate 
for all of these we'll change this name to manager
and then for all of these that are 
currently linked to this column over  
here we're going to paste them as values 
so we're going to go Ctrl shift down  
Ctrl C and then we're gonna paste this as a value 
so alt h v v is a shortcut for that and now that  
means that we can go ahead and remove this column 
by hitting Ctrl minus there you go then under  
quantity you might notice that we've got these 
decimals which don't make too much sense you can't  
really have half a burger and so for this we're 
basically gonna have to round up to a whole number  
for that we're going to use the Roundup formula so 
equals round up hit the top key there the number  
is this one comma and the number of digits for 
us is going to be zero because we want the full  
number close those brackets and hit enter so this 
is going to be our quantity now hit enter there  
and we basically wanna Ctrl shift down Ctrl C 
and then paste as values so alt h v v v again  
there you go so now we can remove this column 
here so we're going to select it and control minus  
then you'll notice that under City here we have 
the city names but we don't necessarily have  
the countries that would be a nice thing to add so 
for this we can actually head over to the data tab  
and go under data types you'll find 
geography here so just click on that  
once you start to see that icon it means that 
it's loaded up what you want to do here is  
hit over to this icon to the side under add 
column and we basically want to add a country  
or a region associated with that City and you 
can see that we have the corresponding country  
for each City if you want to move this city 
column next to the country you can actually  
go ahead and select it up top and we start to 
see these arrows when you hover over it just  
press the shift key and then just drag it across 
like so that should allow you to move everything  
one final thing we haven't done here is test 
if there's any duplicates so for this we can  
simply go under data again and we're just going to 
remove duplicates by going to this icon over here  
so we'll click on that and it's going to be 
for that whole table and we'll simply hit on OK  
and you can see here that we get a notification 
saying that five duplicate values were found and  
removed so we'll hit on OK there and speaking

below alright back to the video great now 
that we've done step one and step two it's  
all about the descriptive statistics so really 
seeing things like what's the average price what  
about the minimum the maximum and so on so for 
this let's hop over to the side and you could  
try to find for the price and for the quantity say 
the average going one by one so type the average  
formula then doing the same thing with the minimum 
the maximum so on but there is a much faster way  
that's actually using a tool called Data analysis 
for that we're gonna have to activate it it should  
be over here to the side under the data ribbon 
if you don't have it like me we can go ahead  
and activate it so we'll head over to file 
go over to the bottom where it says options  
from here we're gonna go into add-ins and we want 
to click on the analysis toolpack here and hit on  
go from here we want to select analysis toolpack 
like I said and we'll hit OK now you can see that  
we have this data analysis option under the data 
ribbon so that's the one that we want to select
from here we want the descriptive 
statistics and we'll hit on OK there  
and the input range is going to be all of 
our prices so we'll go Ctrl shift down there  
and then we want it to be a summary statistics and 
where do we want this let's say we want an output  
range which is going to be up over here so right 
next to the table let's say we put it here to the  
side there we're just going to hit on OK and now 
you can see that for the price which is what we've  
selected we've gotten everything from the mean 
the median mode minimum maximum sum and a bunch  
of other useful information let me repeat that 
same process for the quantity awesome now we've  
got the breakdown by price and by quantity as well 
but one thing that this doesn't quite account for  
is the fact that there could be outliers in our 
price so for that we can go ahead down over here  
we're gonna basically create a new chart which 
is going to be a box and whisker so let's first  
select all of the prices so Ctrl shift down 
and down over here you're gonna find this icon  
click on that and we want a box and whisker 
basically this one over here and don't worry  
if you can't interpret it we'll look at it just 
in a second let me move that all the way up  
so once we have it in here this is basically 
telling us a few different things so first  
these top and bottom lines are telling us 
the maximums so the Max and the Min if you  
will and then in here this box represents the 
first and the third quartile and then you can  
see that we've got that X which is the average 
then we've got a line which is going to be the  
median and finally we've got these dots over here 
which represent all of our outliers in our price  
now if we want to dig a bit further into this 
it would be nice to see the x-axis maybe we can  
put something like the manager's name to see where 
exactly this is coming from maybe it's one manager  
that might be reporting the data wrong so we'll 
go to right click for that go under select data  
edit the horizontal category access label 
here and what we're going to do is put the  
managers so we're going to select all 
of these Ctrl shift down and hit on OK  
and hit on OK again now if we go all the way back 
up you can see what that breakdown looks like  
by manager and it seems to be that all of these 
outliers are accumulated with Joel maybe we should  
have a word with him now moving on to step 3 which 
is data analysis so over here you can see that  
we've got three different questions that we want 
to solve which is what is our best selling product  
what is our total revenue and that's what's our 
Revenue breakdown by payment method so if we go  
back to the table here you notice that we don't 
actually have a column for Revenue so that's one  
that we're going to have to calculate simply 
by multiplying the price and the quantity so  
we'll do that over here let me add an extra column 
there and let's call this something like Revenue
and the formula for it is going to be equals the 
quantity multiplied by the price and we'll just  
hit enter there that should be calculated for us 
and then we'll go up over here again and for all  
of this analysis we can actually do most of it 
with a pivot table so we'll head over to insert  
pivot table the table or range we're interested in 
is all of this range so once we select one of the  
cells we can just go to control a that's going to 
select all of them and we want this in a location  
in an existing worksheet which we already selected 
so we'll hit OK great from here we can start doing  
all the breakdown so what's our best selling 
product so let's do this by quantity we're going  
to select the products as the rows just hover that 
over and then we're gonna check the quantity over  
here as the values great now we have all of that 
breakdown if we want to sort it from highest to  
lowest we can go to right click and go to sort 
and we'll sort largest to smallest and now you  
can see that beverages is our largest at 35 000. 
then secondly we've got what is our total revenue  
for this one we're simply going to have to select 
the revenue so first we'll remove these let's take  
this out and we'll take this out as well and 
we just have to select the revenue and put it  
under values that should give us the sum of total 
revenue which seems to be 812 000. and finally our  
Revenue breakdown by payment method so for that 
we're gonna get all of the payment methods and  
put those under the rosie like so but to see the 
breakdown better it probably makes more sense as  
a percentage so what we can actually do is go to 
right click and from here go to summarize show  
values ask sorry and we're going to show them as a 
percentage of the grand total now you can see that  
full breakdown and it seems like credit cards are 
the most dominant here now that you've seen how to  
do some of the data analysis let me show you what 
a final report might look like this one here is  
fairly simplified so you can see that we've got 
this drop down which is using data validation  
to select the manager and everything dynamically 
changes so if I select dwell I'm able to see which  
country and city is from using the X lookup and 
then just below that using the sum ifs I'm able  
to derive his particular revenue for fries and 
the other products as well as his total revenue  
and these data bars over here are done using 
the conditional formatting if you're unsure  
how to do this type of formulas you can check 
out this video over here or this link over here  
to take our Excel codes hit the like and that
