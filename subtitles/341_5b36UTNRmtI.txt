a computer software is a set of
instructions data or programs used to
operate a computer or perform a
particular task in a system but today we
are going to look into something that is
known as sdlc sdlc refers to the
development of a software for a system
hi guys and welcome to yet and
interesting we video i simply learn but
before we begin if you love watching
tech videos subscribe to our channel and
hit the bell icon to remiss an update
from us now without further ado let's
take a look at the agenda for this
session
the first heading is what is sdlc
to begin with we will know some
introductory knowledge about sdlc
moving on with why do we apply sdlc
continuing with different phases
involved in the development of a
software
as for the last different models used to
develop sdlc let's begin with the first
heading that is sdlc
the software development lifecycle or
sdlc refers to the planned designing of
software models that are systematically
evaluated at each point by different
protocols involved in the sdlc phases
the sdlc process is defined using
multiple phases that involves different
protocols to be acted upon the software
development for example planning phase
defining designing phase building
testing
deploying and maintenance
these are some of the main phases that
leads to development of a software for
the client
moving on let's take a look at why do we
apply the sdlc cycle
the reason to apply the sdlc lifecycle
in the development of a software is
because
it provides a team with a developed
lifecycle format or a framework to build
a software from scratch
it provides better control over each
development phase of the software
designing
where the coding is to be done what
about the errors in the development
and different particular points or
attributes that affect the functioning
of a software
it also improved client interaction with
the multiple development phases of the
software now let's move on to the next
heading that is
different phases that involve the
development of a software
the sdlc lifecycle is divided into
multiple steps to provide a better end
product according to the client's
request
which are
planning and requirement analysis at
this step the planning and the
requirement of the software is discussed
with the client
moving on with defining the requirements
according to the planned scenario we
will define certain terms for
development of the software
containing with designing the software
coding or implementing the physical
points of the software
moving on to the testing phase where
different scenarios are used to test the
overall functioning of a software
as for the last step we have deployment
and maintenance where the developed
software
is deployed and is assessed by the users
to check for any errors or bugs moving
on let's take a look at the individual
phases of sdlc the first phase is
planning and requirement analysis
planning is the most important step for
software development
the developer performs the requirement
analysis for the software in theme
moving on the software development data
is obtained from client service and
information
which are used from consumers or sales
team
the analysis data acts as the basis for
planning the development route for the
required software
also the analysis data is used to check
for any risk
as for quality assurance of the software
being developed at different stages of
sdlc
moving on we have the second stage that
is defining requirements
with the completion of planning step the
next step is to present the software
requirements and documents to the client
and the stakeholders for verification if
they are satisfied with the planned
scenario
the task of defining requirement is
performed by the software requirement
specification document also known as srs
document
which include all the data and
information related to the product been
developed
moving on we have the third step
that is designing the software
in this step the srs document is used by
the developer to use the most optimized
architecture for the development of the
software
the developed architecture is used using
the dds document also known as design
document specification
which is shared with the analyst and the
stakeholders to check multiple
attributes of the software
moving on after accessing all the
possible attributes the best software
design is used for the development
depending upon the requirements
different designs are used to develop
the software
the first one is known as high level
design and the other one is known as low
level design
moving on let's take a look at the
fourth step of sdlc
that is developing software
using the designing outcome from the
previous step the developers begin the
coding implementation which is in
accordance with the architecture design
by the developers
programming tools such as interpreters
compilers and debuggers are used to
design the best and the most organized
software design
it is developed using multiple languages
for example python kotlin java c
now let's move on to the next stage that
is software testing
in this stage the developed software is
tested with multiple test cases
and different scenarios to ensure proper
execution of all the functions included
in the software
with respect to the testing of a
software in sdlc each phase has multiple
case scenarios to assess it
through all the test cases done the bugs
errors or the flaws of the software
product are fixed that are to meet the
requirement of the client as well as the
srs document now let's move on to the
last heading in phases of sdlc
that is deployment and maintenance of
software
after the completion of testing phase
the last step is to deploy the completed
product in the market
which is to be used by the users and
check for any issues that may arise
using that
with regard to the maintenance of the
software there are generally three
formats to be used the first one known
as upgrade
that is upgrading the application to the
latest system version
then we have
bug fixing
that is removing errors or any bugs that
may arise during the execution of the
software
as for the last we have enhancement that
means installation of new features for
the existing product with this we are
completed with the multiple steps
involved in the sdlc processing now
let's move on to the next heading that
is
models used in sdlc
the sdlc models are applied because they
provide a pre-designed model
for the developer to use
let's take a look at multiple models
that sdlc applies
the first one is waterfall model
incremental model
iterative model
spiral model
v model and the last agile model
these are some of the most
generally used models in sdlc
but the thing is why do we apply these
models in sdlc
because they provide a base for planning
software projects for multiple
attributes
it also provide a pre-applied framework
for the new software project
as well it decreases the chances of bugs
and errors occurring in the software
with this we are completed with all the
headings in the session for sdlc
lifecycle if you have any questions
