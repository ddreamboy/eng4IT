hey my name is Felipe and welcome to my 
channel, in this video I'm going to show  
you a fully comprehensive computer vision roadmap 
I'm going to show you all the skills you should  
learn to become a computer vision engineer
and all the different ways 
in which you can specialize in computer vision
and I'm also giving you very specific resources 
you can use in order to learn all the skills 
I show you in this roadmap and now let's get started
so let's get started with 
this computer vision roadmap, in this
video I'm going to show you an entire roadmap in 
order to go from zero from scratch from having  
absolutely no background in IT whatsoever up to a 
complete expert computer visual engineer so let's  
get started the first step you should follow 
in this roadmap is covering the fundamentals  
and when I say fundamentals I mean Python and 
opencv these two skills are definitely the most  
important skills you should start with in order to 
become a computer vision engineer, and this video,  
this computer vision roadmap is an updated version 
of one of my previous videos, and in this version  
I have added some specific resources you can take 
you can follow in order to learn all the different  
skills I am going to show you in this roadmap so 
in order to Learn Python and in order to learn OpenCV  
you can take a look at these two resources I have 
added over here and regarding opencv this is a  
three hours long fully comprehensive course of 
opencv with python and I definitely recommend  
you to check out this course but if you do not 
have three hours in order to take this course  
then these are the most important lessons you 
should take in order to cover the basics of  
opencv with python so if you do have three hours 
then please take a... take a look at this course but  
if you do not don't worry you can just take some 
of these lessons and you are going to cover the  
most important aspects of opencv with python so 
this is the first step you should take in order to  
learn computer vision, in order to become a computer 
vision engineer and now let's continue the next  
step in this roadmap is the basics of machine 
learning, machine learning is very very very  
important in computer vision and these are the 
most important things you should learn, these are  
the four most important tasks in computer vision 
image classification object detection semantic  
segmentation and pose detection and this is the 
way I recommend you to learn machine learning by  
learning how to solve these four very specific 
problems, these four very specific tasks, so by  
learning how to build an image classifier how to 
build an object detector how to build a semantic  
segmentation algorithm and how to build a pose 
detector oh my God you will have learned so much  
machine learning and you will be super super 
proficient in machine learning these are the  
most important machine learning tasks in computer 
vision and these are some very specific resources  
you could use in order to learn how to solve 
these problems right these are some courses  
and some tutorials I recommend you in order to 
solve these problems in order to learn how to  
solve these problems and by doing so by solving 
these problems you are going to learn how to use  
some very specific tools which are... let me show you 
scikit learn yolo V8 yolo nas pytorch tensorflow  
and many many many more tools and please pay 
attention because this is very very very important  
these are the tools we use in order to solve these 
problems right but the important thing is not the  
tools we use the important thing is the problems 
we are solving by using the tools right so my  
recommendation for you is do not focus on learning 
how to use the very specific tools but focus on  
how you are going to solve each one of these 
problems and by doing so you are going to learn  
how to use different tools right my recommendation 
for you is do not focus on learning the tools  
focus on learning how to solve these very specific 
problems but if you are one of those people who  
prefer to learn the tools that's perfectly fine 
I have also added some resources for you right  
because I know we all have different preferences 
so if you prefer to learn how to use the  
tools these are some resources you could use right 
but remember my recommendation is do not focus on  
the tools focus on how you're going to solve 
the high level problems image classification  
object detection semantic segmentation and pose 
detection which are perhaps the most important  
machine learning problems in computer vision now 
let's continue and you can see that from here from  
basic machine learning you can take it in either 
one of these two paths let's take it over here for  
now and later on I'm going to show you what's 
over here so following this path we have the  
specialization right now that you feel confident 
in Python and opencv, now that you have learned  
the basics of machine learning now it's time to 
specialize right and you have many different ways  
to specialize one of these different ways is low 
level programming and electronics which basically  
involves C++ and how to work with an 
edge device for example Arduino or jetson nano  
and the reason this is one of the ways in which 
you can specialize in computer vision is because  
although C++ is a very very very important 
programming language you can definitely take up  
many projects as a computer vision engineer 
and you can just become a computer vision  
engineer without really doing anything related 
to low level programming or anything related to  
electronics right it's perfectly possible so this 
is one of the ways in which you can specialize if  
you want to go deep into low level programming if 
you want to go deep into working with electronics  
working with robotics for example then you can 
just specialize and you can do it learning C++  
and learning how to work with this type of 
edge devices now another way in which you can  
specialize is by taking the research path 
right, by doing research and this  
involves learning very advanced machine learning 
and also very advanced mathematics there's a huge  
misconception in computer vision which is that you 
definitely need very advanced mathematics and you  
differently need to know how to work with very 
Advanced mathematical objects and operations in  
order to do computer vision and that is not true 
that's a misconception that is false I can tell  
you that you can definitely work in the field as 
a computer vision engineer and you can definitely  
take many many projects and you can definitely 
make a lot of money as a computer visual engineer  
by knowing Python opencv and the basics of machine 
learning only by knowing these skills you will be  
able to solve the machine learning part of many 
many projects and you will be able to solve many  
projects. Knowing the advanced mathematics and 
the advanced machine learning and the advanced  
everything is not absolutely needed that's why this 
is... I consider this is one of the ways in which you  
can specialize right and if you want to take this 
route these are some very specific resources you  
could take right and I forgot to mention these 
are some very specific resources you can follow  
in order to learn this other way to specialize in 
computer vision which is low level programming and  
electronics but let's continue now let's take 
it to the other way which you can specialize  
which is generative Ai and this basically involves 
image generation and also text generation right this is  
something that I would say it's huge already 
it's already a very very important field in  
computer vision and my thoughts are that in the 
next few years this is going to be bigger and  
bigger this is going to be a very very important 
field in computer vision and these are some very  
specific tutorials from my own YouTube channel 
you can take in order to learn how to work with  
image generation and text generation in a computer 
vision project now let's continue these are  
some of the ways in which you can specialize 
in computer vision these are definitely not  
all the ways in which you can specialize there 
could be other ways but I think these are some  
of the most important paths you could take as 
a computer vision engineer but now let's take  
it back remember that from basic machine 
learning we could take another path right let's  
see what's over here and this is where we have 
all the software related skills right because  
remember as a computer vision engineer you are 
not working on a vacuum right you are working  
with other software developers you are building 
products you are doing some things which involve  
software so the more you know about software 
the more software related skills you may have  
is going to be much much more better for you 
and these are some very specific examples of  
some very specific software skills which are very 
important in computer vision as a computer vision  
engineer you definitely need to know how to work 
with a Version Control software for example GitHub  
you'll definitely need to know how to work with 
Docker is going to be a plus for sure in your  
career if you know how to work with Docker it's 
very important you know how to work with a cloud  
provider with a cloud development platform for 
example AWS Google cloud or Azure and it's also  
a plus it's something very important if you are 
familiar with web development technologies let me  
tell you a very quick story about me about myself 
when I was just starting in computer vision I  
completely underestimated how important it is all 
these software related skills and I thought that  
by learning Python opencv and the Very basics 
of machine learning the very Basics by learning  
how to build an image classifier, the very basics 
of machine learning I was all set I was ready to  
work in the top companies in the field to work 
in Google in Tesla in SpaceX... I thought I  
was ready, that was all, that was it, and I was 
wrong I was so so super wrong for many different  
reasons and one of them is because I completely 
underestimated all these software related skills  
if you are going to work in computer vision 
you'll definitely need to know something other  
than computer vision and this is very important 
because this is very often underestimated by many  
people in the computer vision industry or in 
the machine learning industry there are many  
people who believe who think that by learning 
the basics of machine learning that's it  
that's not all if you're going to work in the 
field or you need to know something other than  
computer vision and these are some very specific 
resources you could take in order to learn all  
these skills and also remember that working in a 
company as an employee it's only one of the many  
many different career choices you can take in your 
professional career you could also be something  
like a freelancer, a freelance computer vision 
engineer, and if you decide to be a freelancer  
and a client hires you to do something like 
building a machine learning model, building  
an object detector and serving this model through 
an API and you tell the client 'okay I can help  
you building the model but in order to serve it 
through the API hire someone else because I don't  
even know what's an API' the client is going to 
say something like 'oh okay okay I am going to  
hire someone else, I'm going to hire someone else 
to do the entire project is going to be much more  
affordable it's going to be much more easier to 
manage than if I hire many different developers  
to make each one of the tasks in this project' so 
this is especially the case if you decide to be  
something like a freelancer because the moment 
you tell your client you don't know how to do  
something the moment this client replaces you by 
someone else so this is very important if you want  
to be a freelancer as well now let's continue 
I have already show you the entire roadmap you  
should take in order to become a computer vision 
engineer with very specific resources and I have  
also shown you all the different ways in which 
you can specialize as a computer visual engineer  
now let's continue because now it's time to 
show you how to enhance your skillset, how to  
grow your skills and one of the ways in which you 
can grow your skills as a computer vision engineer  
is by working on projects by making projects by 
doing projects by hands-on experience working  
on projects and there are two different ways in 
which you can do that one of them is by following  
coding tutorials and projects in YouTube, 
and there are many many projects you can take you  
can do on YouTube these are only a few examples 
of some of my tutorials of my projects in this  
YouTube channel and you can also take many paid 
courses right if you want to take your skills a  
step further if you really want to become like 
an absolute expert then you also have many paid  
resources you could use in order to enhance your 
skillset even further right and these are only  
a few examples also from my own paid products for 
example this is a project which is available in my  
Patreon and in this project I show you the entire 
process of how to build a video summarization API  
I take you from the requirements up to the project 
deliverable and I show you every single step of  
this process how to do the planning how to do the 
system design how to work in the execution every  
single step of this process and this is exactly 
how a real world computer vision project looks like,
then this is another example this is also 
available my Patreon and this is a very Advanced lesson  
on how to train a machine learning model and it 
involves how to control the randomness when you  
are training a machine learning model this is 
a very very Advanced lesson and these are a few  
resources you will take in order to enhance your 
skillset as a computer vision engineer and then  
you also have other resources and in these other 
resources are for example books you could read  
books on computer vision in order to improve 
your skill set as a computer vision engineer  
these are only a few examples of some of the books 
you could read in order to become a super absolute  
expert computer vision engineer then another very 
interesting resource is joining a community and  
these are some examples this Discord server is 
this YouTube channel Discord server right this is  
our community and this is a very very interesting 
resource the way usually work is that the members  
of our community post the projects in which 
they are currently working in and everyone else  
recommend this user different things he or she can 
do with his or her project we say something like  
hey have you tried to do this have you tried to 
do the other thing have you tried to do this with  
the data I don't know we collaborate in many 
different ways so we help everyone with their  
computer vision projects this is a very very very 
interesting resource in order to go deeper into  
your knowledge of computer vision then these 
are some subreddits you could consider, computer  
vision, machine learning, these are some super 
high levels subreddits but you also have  
many other subreddits which are very very valuable 
in order to learn more about a very very specific  
niche for example this one about stable diffusion 
I have used this subreddit a lot lately because I  
have been learning a lot about stable diffusion and 
this subreddit is perhaps one of the most valuable  
resources in order to learn stable diffusion 
so these are only a few examples of some of the  
communities and some of the subreddits you could 
use and then another very interesting resource in  
order to go deeper into your computer vision 
knowledge is joining a competition, competing  
with other people that's oh my God that's going 
to take your skill set a step further for sure in  
order to do so I recommend you to use kaggle 
which is perhaps the most important and the  
most relevant site in order to do competitive 
computer vision in order to join a competition  
in which you have to train a computer vision 
model and compete against other competitors so  
this is going to be all for this computer vision 
roadmap please let me know what you think in the
