hi my name is professor don patterson
and in this lecture i'd like to talk a
little bit about the concept of
ubiquitous computing
and how it leads into the idea of cloud
computing
key points from this lecture are to
recognize that ubiquitous computing is a
paradigm for people's relationship to
computers
about the scale the invisibility and
then what results from the changes
when we get a mobile-first kind of world
so let's start with the idea of what is
ubiquitous computing let's give it a
definition
we can start by looking at what the
definition of ubiquitous is
and from this dictionary entry we can
see that ubiquitous means present
appearing or found everywhere and you
might use it in a
sentence like the air is ubiquitous it's
all around me
or like the one here in the dictionary
cowboy hats are ubiquitous among the
male singers
okay in one sense then
when we talk about ubiquitous computing
what we mean is we mean a world in which
computers are all around us
they're part of our daily routine we use
them when we're
doing work and when we're doing leisure
we use them to get places and we use
them when we
are still at home and at work all the
different places where we are
but ubiquitous computing is also an
academic discipline as well
so beyond just describing a kind of
computing
it also is a term that refers to a
particular line of research
and that research started with an
article published in
scientific american in 1991 called the
computer for the 21st century
by a guy named mark weiser he was
working at xerox park at the time
and he was thinking about the ways in
which technology was advancing
looking at the ways that different
philosophers had been thinking about
tool usage
and putting together a prediction about
what the world was going to be like
his predictions were remarkably good
considering they were made in 1991
good 25 years before the iphone came out
and yet he was predicting a kind of
mobile environment
or a mobile computing
[Music]
world that's very much like the one that
we have today
one of the things that he thought a lot
about was about ways of
waves of computing that go
through different kinds of relationships
that people have with computers
and as a good computer scientist i'm
going to start with wave zero which is
one that wiser didn't really
talk about but which i think is
important to point out and i would call
this one the zero wave of computer
computing and this was the age of
computerless computing
and to give it a cut a rough timeline
rough time frame i'd say that
it was between about 1930 and 1940 when
this was
um happening at this point computers are
theoretical technology
and individuals like church and alan
turing
established some fundamental limits on
computability
they were kind a new kind of
mathematician
kind of mathematician that would
eventually become a computer scientist
but they existed at a time before there
was actually a physical computer around
to work on
and using some abstract ideas of what a
computer would be like
they talked about some fundamental
problems like the p
equals np problem or whether a class of
computing problems called polynomial
time algorithms
are really the same as another class of
algorithms called
called non-deterministic polynomial time
algorithms
this question if p equals np remains one
of the most foundational
theoretical theoretical problems that
exist in computer science today
i would say the zero wave of computing
is a little bit like where we're at with
quantum computing today
while there are some small quantum
computers and different approaches and
different organizations that are taking
steps
trying to create them there's a much
richer set of research that has been
done
thinking about what a quantum computer
could do if we had a fully featured
quantum computer that was much larger
than a handful of
qubits so the same way that we have sort
of
an idea of what a quantum computer might
be like if it is fully realized
in the zero wave of computing the idea
of what the cur the computers that we
have today
are going to be like we're being decided
of course we did end up with the
computers that they were
envisioning so wiser introduced an idea
of the first wave and the first wave
centered around mainframe computing
giving it a rough time frame about 1960
to 1970
and in this world there were massive
computers doing simple data processing
but there were very few computers in the
world um here's a picture of a mainframe
with a dot ma
it's with a printer i think it's a dot
matrix printer in front of it one of the
main ways in which you got output out of
these computers
many people use these computers so you
couldn't afford very many of them
organizations like maybe government
agencies or scientific agencies
would have them maybe a large
corporation might have them
they did relatively simple work by our
standards today
in the military context they computed
various kinds of ballistics tables
in a business context they might have
computed simple spreadsheets or
done accounting work and in scientific
environments they might have been the
first
kinds of weather prediction sources of
weather prediction at the time
well wiser indicated that this would be
the beginning and then predicted that
the second wave would come around
the second wave which we eventually came
to know is desktop computing
roughly the for the time frame from 1980
to 1990
time when microsoft really came to the
forefront as a massive global
corporation
that did computing what drove it were
business applications these were the
primary applications of the desktop
computer
and the vision would be would be that
there would be one computer per desk
this was focused on the business
environment and desktop computers looked
a little bit like
this one here although this is a desktop
computer at home so
pardon the slight mismatch in that way
these computers were connected in
intranets and they were in a massive
global network but
they weren't really in the internet as
we know it today mostly they were um
intranets that were isolated from one
another they existed within particular
academic institutions or within
particular offices connecting the
computers in those local areas
with maybe very small or if any
connections to the rest of the internet
and all of these computers were wired
the idea of a wireless computer wasn't
really
a thing that was was entering the market
at that point
eventually of course these computers
moved into the home environment where
they would be used for working from home
and sometimes entertainment purposes
games
maybe learning educational context as
well
wiser than said the third wave would be
ubiquitous computing as we know it today
roughly from 2000 maybe to the present
i'm not sure that we would say we've
gone beyond the ubiquitous computing
stage yet this is a stage of computing
where
it's not really business or government
applications that are driving usage
it's much more about information
creation information
access and communication that's driving
the usage
so here's an example of third wave
computing this is someone with a
early phone taking a picture of a lion
taking it to share it with someone else
or maybe just for their own memory
but certainly not driven by a business
application trying to get some sort of
competitive advantage
in this world though we're starting to
think about the relationship between
computers changing so there are multiple
computers per environment or multiple
computers per person
terms like wan wide area network lan
local area network
pan personal area network and ad hoc
networking
came to the forefront and wireless
networking was clearly
a direction that the computers were
taking at this point
why is it predicted that computers would
begin to disappear
now when you first hear that you think
oh computer's disappearing that's
because they're getting smaller yeah i
get that
and while wiser was certainly talking
about that in part
he was also talking about computers
disappearing in a very different way
he was talking about computers
disappearing uh from
our awareness when we're using them so
as an example you might think about
something like
a hammer a hammer if you know how to use
one and it's functioning well
you don't really think about it when
you're using it to hammer in a nail
you act through that hammer to build
your
birdhouse or your house or whatever
you're trying to build or another
example
is a car once you've learned how to
drive a car
and you want to go somewhere you don't
think very much about the controls of
the car
when you turn you turn the steering
wheel but you're focusing mostly on
where you're going when you want to go
faster you hit the accelerator when you
want to slow down you hit the brake
but those controls become an extension
of your will and an extension of your
body
as you move through the world as long as
the car is functioning okay and
you could just work through that those
vehicle the vehicle or the hammer
to accomplish what it is that you want
to try and do
in a similar way wiser anticipated that
we would begin to work through computers
in this way
that we would stop thinking about the
fact that we're using computers and we
would start just working through them
and they would become tools that we
become very naturally attuned to
in many cases the kinds of things that
we do today maybe with
instagram or instant messaging or
computing
or communications we're still kind of
very aware that we're using computers so
they haven't exactly shifted seamlessly
into the background
those things are pretty obviously front
and center yet
there are many computers that we
interact with on a daily basis where we
don't actually think very much about the
computer
the car for example is cars modern cars
are filled with all kinds of computing
devices appliances that we use are
filled with all kinds of
computing devices maybe in some of our
voice enabled assistants
like alexa or siri or google home
we're beginning to get a sense we're
beginning to lose
uh focus on the computer and we're
starting to be able to act naturally
with our computers and
not think so much about the technology
that's supporting it along the way
well the relationship to computers
changes in these each
each of these waves in the zeroth wave
the relationship is just a thought
experiment people are thinking about
computers
in the first wave there are many people
working on one computer
so a mainframe computer team of
government scientists
a team of corporate accountants all
working together on one computer in one
particular space
in the second wave there's a one-to-one
mapping
between individuals and computers
desktop computing paradigm being the
predominant way in the third wave we
start to get into a world that starts
that seems a little bit more familiar to
the one we're in now
where one person has many different
computers
maybe a phone maybe a smart watch maybe
a desktop maybe a server maybe a tv
maybe kind of sophisticated appliances
maybe you have a fancy
interface on your car and now one
individual has many
many different computers that they're
managing
the relationship has changed in this
third wave
another thing that wiser brought out in
addition to the relationship between the
people and the computers in terms of
scale and also in terms of the
invisibility of the computers as they
dropped to the background of our
consciousness as we were using them
he also wanted to draw a distinction
between different kinds of computing
that even at the time were people were
very excited about that's the difference
between ubiquitous computing and virtual
reality
one thing about ubiquitous computing is
that when you do ubiquitous computing
actions and when you're operating in
that kind of paradigm you're thinking
about
the devices adapting to the way in which
we live our life
so here's an example of a phone and just
in a very simple example
as you turn the phone 90 degrees so it
goes from portrait to landscape mode
the screen layout changes this is a
really simple example but it's a way in
which the computer is aware of its
environment and it adapts
to the way that we're moving through the
world likewise as this is a mapping
application
if that dot presumably is where i am
it's also responding to my location
and it's changing the way in which it's
displaying that information
in order to react to the world now a
proper ubiquitous computing
application would take some kind of
action on behalf of the user when
they're in a
particular space and have indicated a
need for some kind of
computational support this is just
displaying the location rather than
actually doing anything in particular
now on the other side though is virtual
reality this is an example of someone
using virtual reality gear
a headset that's covering their complete
vision gloves that have haptics in it
through which they can control objects
in the virtual
world and receive feedback and what is
it that they're experiencing
well they might be looking at a virtual
world like this virtual world from
open simulator created by users
completely
covering the field of view of the
individual and the user can move through
it
but they have to be careful because it's
very easy to forget that you're
connected to this gear and if you move
too fast you might
pull a wire or if you're in a more
mobile environment
you might hit a real wall as you try and
walk through the virtual environment
and don't see an actual don't see a
virtual wall where the real wall is
a third kind of thing like virtual
reality is something that i would call a
mirror world
a mirror world is something maybe more
like google earth or google maps
where a virtual world is constructed
that's designed to mirror the real world
so that you can enter into the mirror
world and use it as a proxy
for exploring the real world in some way
maybe for directions
maybe to get a view of what a different
location is like
maybe to experience the landscape or
real estate or something along those
lines for
a google map view these are two
different very
different ways of thinking about
interacting with computing but then
there in the middle is augmented reality
augmented reality is a little of both
sides and maybe we could think of this
as being the boundary between ubiquitous
computing and virtual reality
what happens with augmented reality is
you use some sort of device and you hold
it up and a camera on the one side of
the device
takes a picture of the world in front of
you and shows you what you could simply
see if you didn't have the camera in
front of you
but the benefit of looking at the
display is that the computer
the phone in this case can overlay the
the view on the camera
with information relevant to the view
that you're experiencing
so in this case the application is
location aware and as you look at
different
things in your immediate environment it
will overlay it with icons
recommendations and information about
the places that you're viewing
kind of a mix between virtual reality
and ubiquitous computing in that way
now the key thing about these two
paradigms and the way that
wiser differentiated them was that
ubiquitous computing was really about
computers entering the humans world
computers getting out of the office and
out of the labs and
and starting to understand the world the
sensing
the temperature the experiences that the
human was having and
adapting to that virtual reality in
contrast
is a human entering into the computer's
world
accepting all of the input and sensory
experience that the computer wants to
generate
the human then reacts to the computer
instead of the computer reacting to the
human
different applications for both sides
but also different ideas
about what these kinds of paradigms of
computing were
or are all right so
what's next what's next with our
relationship with computers
wiser really only saw ubiquitous
computing as being
the third wave it didn't really talk
much about what the next phase might be
one thing that's clear is that there are
going to be more and more computers
and that the relationship between people
and computers might not be quite so
distinct it might not be that computers
are discretely
owned by one particular individual you
might have
a home tv for example that's owned by
multiple people
or you might have phones that you share
computers that you swap or different
accounts so that now
the ability to find these relationships
between different
computers and different people becomes a
lot more muddied a lot more difficult to
associate
the computing resources with particular
individuals
and a real difficult question is how are
we going to manage all of these devices
how are we going to keep track of them
how are we going to do work with them
on top of that there's a whole lot of
maintenance that has to be done
how are we going to keep them operating
how are we going to keep the software up
to date
how are we going to make sure that the
networks are working how are we going to
manage all of that infrastructure
well this is something that i think is
really drives us into cloud computing
this requires professionals and what
kind of professionals will professionals
that run
cloud computing infrastructures
companies like amazon web services
and apple computer businesses that are
eager to
find a way to provide value to different
users and help them navigate
this complex digital environment
so the key points from this lecture are
that ubiquitous computing is really a
paradigm started by mark weiser in the
1990s
that described people's relationships to
computers
on the one hand it talked about scale
talked about the scale of
individuals to number of computers so
one many people to one computer one to
one
and then many computers to one person it
also talked about the scale of the
computer in terms of its physical size
are you working with a big computer or
small computers mentioned in his vision
as well
he also talks about invisibility of
computers yes getting physically smaller
but more importantly
becoming the in
moving into the background of our
consciousness as we work through them
as as we stop to recognize that we're
actually using computers to get work
done and then finally he talked a lot
about what was what's going to result
from those changes
and one of the things that we've seen is
that cloud computing is a valuable tool
for trying to manage
this trajectory going forward
thanks for listening to this short
lecture on ubiquitous computing an
academic discipline that i've done a lot
of work in
and how it leads into the current world
that we're experiencing
with cloud computing services being
offered to us
from a variety of different companies
thank you
