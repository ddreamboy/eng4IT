hey guys how you going
my name is dom and today we're going to
be taking a look at the basics of
javascript events okay so today's video
is going to be perfect for people who
are just starting out to learn
javascript or
you've got a bit of experience under
your belt and you just want to get a
recap on how the events work
okay so of course the first question
here is going to be
what exactly are javascript events well
essentially they're going to allow you
to react to when
certain things happen on the page so for
example
when the user clicks on a button i want
for example
a drop down menu to show or another
example might be
when the user clicks on a submit form i
want
some sort of validation to happen so
basically you have the event
and then you have the action so in
today's video
we're going to cover four main topics
around
the events to of course gain an
understanding of how they work
so the first topic covered is going to
be the usage of the very basic
html inline events okay so these
are things like your on click which
you'll see on many beginner
tutorials the second topic covered is
going to be the usage of the add event
listener function and this one here is
arguably the most
important the third topic is going to be
the usage
of the javascript event object and these
ones right here
are going to tell you information about
the event which just occurred
and the last topic is going to be the
difference between a standard javascript
function
and an arrow function when it comes to
the events so
hope you guys enjoy and learn something
from today's video
let's get right into the first topic
here the
inline html events okay so
starting off with the most basic form of
a javascript event
handler okay so right here i've got a
fairly straightforward
html file and we can see right down here
i've got this div with an id of box and
i've applied some
fairly straightforward css styles to
this
box so now we can see in the browser
it's going to look
something like this so if i go back
inside the text editor we can see
inside the actual html for the box
itself we can see
it says on click alert hey
decode so this right here is the most
basic form
of a javascript event and you'll find
this style
on many different beginner tutorials out
there on the web
now of course it's quite
self-explanatory what this does
when i click on the box i want this to
say alert
hey decode so now if i was to go inside
the browser
we can see upon clicking on the box we
of course get hey
decode right there and that is the most
basic form like i said
of a javascript event handler now
of course if you're using a text editor
like visual
studio code if you go inside the actual
div here
and you specify for example o n or just
on we can see there are many different
events to choose from
and of course when doing your own
project you're going to be googling
these things and finding out exactly
what type of event you need to use for
your own
scenarios an example might be the on
mouse over event and essentially it's
going to allow you to react to when the
user
hovers their mouse over the actual div
or the box in this case right here
so for example i can just say alerts
then i can say
something like hover okay
just like that so now if i was to save
this we can
we can see of course we actually have
two event handlers right here
the onmouseover and the on click and of
course that is perfectly fine and valid
to have
so now saving this right here going
inside the browser
we can see if i was to hover over the
actual box we get hover
right there if i was to then click
on the box we also get hey d code so
right there we can see an example of
adding the two events
right there now what is the problem with
this
style of event handler well you can't
actually do
much inside these two
inside these quotes okay so of course
you can do quite a few things inside
here but of course
once your project gets more complex and
you want to do
many different things inside the event
handler
you're kind of restricted as to what you
can do inside here
and it can get very messy quite quickly
so
the better option is going to be to
essentially put all of your javascript
code
inside its own separate you know section
of the page or its own file
and then do your event handling inside
there instead
it makes it much easier to work with and
of course that brings us to
the add event listener function okay so
ad event listener is going to be the
preferred way for you to add events to
your javascript code
and of course your web page so right
here we can see we get a very similar
example
i've got the exact same div with an id
of box but now
i've opened up this script tag right
here and i've specified some javascript
code okay so essentially it's going to
do the exact same thing
and i can show you this right now so
going inside the browser we can see
upon clicking on the box we get right
here hey
d code so now looking at the actual code
itself
we can see in the javascript the first
line of code here is simply grabbing
the actual div from the html so right
here i'm just saying
a new constant or new variable
called box div is equal to
document.getelementbyid and i'm passing
in box right here so
for those of you who don't know
essentially if i pass in box right here
it's going to grab this div and now
essentially this div
refers to this box div right inside the
javascript code
so now i'm just simply saying box div
dot add event listener and i'm passing
through here
the click event so similar to the
previous example
where we had the mouse over you can also
pass in
mouse over inside here and that is also
going to work
like i mentioned earlier there are many
different javascript events to use so
you're going to have to do your own
searching and find out what you need for
each different scenario
but let's go back to the basic click
event right here
after this we're simply specifying a
javascript
function right inside here and i'm
accepting
the event object right there so we're
going to get to this
very shortly but for now we can simply
ignore that
and then going inside the actual
function body itself
i'm then saying alert hey d code so
essentially
we're moving the alert call from
inside the html in the previous example
to
this function right inside here and this
makes it
a lot easier to work with and
essentially
you're going to have a much better time
writing your javascript code
inside the script tag or an external
file
compared to inside the html so of course
we saw
how that one works now what if i was to
instead of specifying the function right
here
we can actually specify it externally so
this right here is another example
of what you might see so if i was to
specify a function
right inside here i can say function
and call this function handle box
click so essentially this function is
going to do the job of handling
the box click so now i can also accept
the event object
as we did earlier and then i can simply
move
the alert code inside here and then
instead of having this function right
here i can instead just say
handle box click just like that and that
is going to give us the exact same
result it is simply just a different way
of writing it
and you might see this example or style
also
so if i was to save this we can see we
get the
exact same result we can click and we
get hey
decode so now we're going to move on to
taking a look
at the event object right here so let's
look at that
right now okay so moving on to the event
object i'm referring to
this e right here now i know this e
confused me quite a bit
when i first started learning javascript
but it's actually very straightforward
in what it actually does
so essentially this e or the event
object
contains information about the event
which has just
occurred in the case of the click event
you can find many different pieces of
information
about that click for example you can see
if the user was holding down the alt
or the control key when the click
occurred or even
the position of the mouse now to gain
access to
the event object you simply pass through
a name
for the event object right here inside
the function now of course
you can call this whatever you want for
example
it doesn't need to be e we can say ev
or we can even say event right here
realistically
we could say absolutely anything like d
code for example
and that is also going to work but it is
a nice convention
to simply use e or ev as the name for
the event
object okay so that being said
we can then reference or use the object
inside the function
by saying e just like this now
right here i'm simply saying console.log
and i'm passing through e
so essentially this console.log is gonna
tell me
information about the actual object
right there
inside the javascript developer console
so now if i was to save this right here
and go
inside the browser i can then using f12
you can toggle the developer tools right
inside here
and you may need to switch to the
console output right up here
to gain access to of course the console
so now
if i was to click on the object we can
see
so on the div we can see right here we
get the mouse
event inside the console right here and
notice how it says
mouse events there are many different
event
objects in javascript because of course
this one right here
was a click event a click event relates
to the mouse so of course we get the
mouse event
there is also the keyboard event for
example
so now going inside the actual object
itself we can see
there are many different properties
related to
the event which has just occurred for
example
we gain access to the client x and the
client y
and these are just the the mouse
coordinates
when the click occurred we can see we
get 108
and 80 right inside here if i was to
click
again this time in the top left corner
we can see the client x and the client y
are much lower at 10 and 10.
we also gain access to things like the
control key
and the alt key which of course tell you
if the alt or control key were pressed
or held down when the click occurred for
example we can see now
the control key is set to false but if i
was to hold the control key
and click again we get right inside here
control key
sets a true so of course depending on
your own
scenario or use case you're gonna find
these properties useful okay so of
course
it's gonna depend on your own project
what you're doing
you may not need to use any of these
properties and that's perfectly fine but
in many cases you may need to gain
access to these different
information regarding the event to of
course do
different things okay so let's let's
move on now to
the usage of the of the arrow functions
in comparison to the standard javascript
functions
okay so moving on to the final part of
today's video and that is going to be
the difference between standard versus
arrow functions
when it comes to your event handlers
okay so right here we can see
i have two examples of the usage of the
add event
listener method okay so right here we
can see
the first example is very similar if not
the same in fact it is the same
as our previous examples we're simply
saying function and then of course
taking through the event object and then
we're simply saying right down here
console.log and i'm logging out the
value
of this keyword if you don't know what
this keyword refers to
that is perfectly fine this is still
going to make sense
in the second example this one right
here is probably
one of the more modern ways to write
your javascript event
handlers and this one uses an arrow
function
as we can see right here so these serve
a very similar purpose
and they do basically the exact same
thing it's simply just
a different way of writing out a
javascript function
this one is standard and this one is an
arrow function
now we can see i'm also logging out the
value
of the this keyword so now if i was to
save this right here
go inside the browser then click on the
div we can see
we get our two outputs right there
as we can see in the case of the first
example with the standard function
this refers to or this keyword refers to
the actual box itself so basically if i
go back inside here
in this case this refers to the exact
same thing
as box div right there and that is for
standard functions
when it comes to your arrow function
this refers to
the whole window global object itself
so the reason why i pointed this out is
because
of course if you run into errors where
you know certain things are defined or
you know certain things aren't working
just watch out for cases where you may
be using an
arrow function but then using this
keyword always make sure if using this
keyword right here
you want to make sure you use the
standard javascript function
instead of the arrow functions right
down here
if you want to learn more about the
arrow functions in javascript
i've got a whole video dedicated to that
so you can watch that too
if you like and that is the basics of
javascript
events thanks for watching guys and i'll
see you in the next
video
