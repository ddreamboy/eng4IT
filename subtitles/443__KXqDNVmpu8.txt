I'm Mike Chappell and in this shirt Mike
explains video we're going to talk about
the cyber security framework published
by the National Institute of Standards
and technology or nist
nist publishes a cyber security
framework that's free for anyone to use
and it's very popular among cyber
Security Professionals
the goal for the framework is to provide
a common language for understanding
managing and describing cyber security
risks
with this common language organizations
can have more productive conversations
among themselves and with external
Partners such as Auditors and government
agencies
the framework is also designed to help
organizations identify and prioritize
the actions that they might take to
reduce cyber security risk and to manage
any risk that remains
having a framework also helps
organizations align their security
actions across control types now that
said the framework May mean different
things to different people and that's
okay
some organizations May undertake the
exercise of mapping all of their
controls to the framework and building
their next Generation security program
with the framework in mind
Others May simply use the framework as a
reference to help identify whether they
miss any critical security controls
you can find the nist cyber security
framework on the web it's a free
download from nist's website
let's go ahead and take a look at some
of the details of the nist cyber
security framework
here's a high level look at the
framework it consists of five different
functions identify protect detect
respond and recover
now these are in very very broad terms
the things that we all do in information
security
the framework then divides those
functions into categories now those
categories aren't shown on the screen
yet we'll take a look at them in a
moment
each one of those categories is divided
into subcategories and then the
framework provides references that have
detail about each one of those
subcategories
as you can see it's really just a
framework where you can start plugging
in the things that you're going to do to
achieve each of these core cyber
security functions
here's a look at a little more detail
about the framework we're now taking the
functions and expanding them into
categories so we have five functions and
then 23 total categories
for example for the identify function
the cyber security framework gives six
categories Asset Management the business
environment governance risk assessment a
risk management strategy and supply
chain risk management
each of these categories is divided into
subcategories that have much more detail
before I explain those I just want to
take a moment to invite you to visit my
website at certmike.com
on that site I have free study plans put
together to help you earn your next
cyber security certification
the plans tied together the content that
you'll find in study guides video
courses and practice tests to help you
prepare for your next certification exam
and pass that test on the first try

other people discover it if you
subscribe to my channel you'll be among
the first to see my new cyber security
videos as they come out the framework
then goes into a much higher level of
detail when you start breaking out the
subcategories so in the asset management
category of the identify function we
have six sub-categories and they talk
about things like the inventory of
physical devices and systems the
inventory of software platforms and
applications how we map organizational
communication and data flows and so on
as you can see we're getting into the
real details of security here and there
are quite a few references to other
standards for each one of these
subcategories for people who are looking
for more detail on how you might go
about achieving these goals
now remember what you're looking at here
is the detail for one category of one
function
remember there are five different
functions and 23 total categories so
this cyber security framework winds up
being a very lengthy document
security control Frameworks play an
important role in information security
While most organizations don't follow
them letter for letter these Frameworks
do provide a useful tool for Designing
the appropriate controls for any
organization
