20 years ago, I was advocating for JavaScript.
My story was that JavaScript is a much
better language than anybody knows
and that if we use it properly we can do amazing
things about it and it can change the world
and in fact that happened.
But now my evangel is that
we should stop using JavaScript.
That it has so many congenital defects 
it really is a smelly language.
There's a just a lot of crap in it.
And it's still maybe for its field of application
the best language in the world 
for doing that kind of stuff
but that's not good enough.
We should be moving on to the 
next generation of languages.
It used to be that we'd get new computer 
languages about every generation.
 I started with Fortran and then C and  
C++ and Java and JavaScript and 
so on and then it kind of stopped.
There are still people developing 
languages but nobody cares.
One person can make a programming
language, a really good one,
but you can't get adoption for it.
There are lots of terrible mistakes 
in the way that the web works,
in the way our operating systems 
work, and we can't get new ones.
We're just stuck with this crap and they
keep piling new features on everything
and the new features always 
create new problems and
it doesn't have to be like that. We could 
be using really clean operating systems
with really clean languages and really 
clean runtimes and doing all this stuff
in a much more reliable way.
But we don't seem to want to do that.
I've done JavaScript for a generation.
It's time for the next thing.
And I don't think that should be a
considered a radical point of view. I 
think it should be a normal evolutionary view.
