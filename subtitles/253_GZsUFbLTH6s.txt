hi everyone
this is going to be a very short and
focused video on four types of cloud
deployment model
along with some of their variants
let's start with discussing the basic
and the most famous cloud deployment
model which is public cloud
please note that
the diagram used here is a repeat of
what was shown in the previous video of
this very series which was titled
introduction to cloud computing
the intent of that video was to
introduce cloud computing to you
with the help of
how a public cloud looks like
here i have explained it in terms of
deployment model
so
in this model the infrastructure is
hosted at cloud service providers
physical boundaries and can be made
available to or basically can be shared
by
multiple individuals and organizations
and hence promotes multi-tenancy
servers here are shared
this model is more cost effective one
this was a very initial model that was
used and
it hugely became popular
but for large organizations who had
certain data security
data privacy jurisdiction and other
regulatory requirements it still didn't
solve their problems
now
let's move on to discussing private
cloud which solve this problem for large
organizations
private cloud is one where an
infrastructure is operated exclusively
for an organization and is not shared
with any other organization
there can be variance to this
first variant is
when the servers or machines or
infrastructure is hosted within the
physical boundaries of an organization
for which the cloud is being set up
this is typically the organization's
data center
here a particular data center or a part
of a data center that organization owns
can be dedicated for cloud
this variant is popularly known as
on-premise or simply on-prem
the next variant to this is where the
infrastructure which is to be
exclusively hosted and operated for an
organization is hosted on cloud service
providers physical boundaries
this is known as off-premise
only one organization will have access
to this even though it is on
not on their data center
and finally in terms of who operates
both these type of setups it can be the
organization or the cloud service
provider
which could be another two variants
private cloud did solve the problem of
data security and compliance but it
didn't fully utilize the benefits that
that cloud provides
hence came hybrid cloud which is now the
most popular one amongst large
organization and is also the way forward
simply put a hybrid cloud is a
combination of at least one public cloud
and at least one private cloud
here
private cloud can be on-premise or
off-premise
what's shown in the diagram is a hybrid
cloud that uses a combination of an
on-premise private cloud
and a public cloud
so how best can this model work for
large organizations
well
the best way is to use on-premise
private cloud to keep applications and
data that is core to the business of the
organization and which has specific
regulatory requirements
on the other hand
applications that are not closer to core
business and are genetic in nature are
good candidates for being hosted at
public cloud
next and final type of deployment model
is community cloud
this is a relatively newer
and an interesting model
here
organizations with common requirements
and interests share a cloud
infrastructure
in terms of hosting and managing this
cloud there could be various
combinations it can be hosted or managed
by one organization combination of
organizations or by cloud service
provider itself
considering the requirements and use
cases
an example of where this type of model
can work
and this is just a thought
is kyc
kyc is performed by banks during
onboarding of a customer as well as
periodically
there is a lot of duplicated efforts and
costs that take place during this
process
a community cloud can be ideal place in
future to share such information across
banks
another example is various government
agencies and bodies
using this type of model to share data
for better governance
in terms of costs this model sits
somewhere between a public cloud and a
private cloud setup
