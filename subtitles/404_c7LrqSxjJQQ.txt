In this power BI for beginner tutorial,
I'm gonna give you a quick introduction.
Now, power BI can feel overwhelming
because it has so many different
components. That's why,
what I suggest you do is that
you just follow along with me.
I have the files that you need
in the description of this video,
download them follow along.
And after 20 minutes,
you've created first power BI dashboard,
which you've published to the web.
Ready? Let's get moving
in case you don't have power BI installed
yet you can do that really quickly
from the Microsoft store. So just
open Microsoft store from your PC.
Look for power BI. You're gonna see
it pop up here, power BI desktop,
select that and install it from here.
So you'll see the install option.
If it's not installed yet on your PC,
you can also just go to power bi.com,
go to products and install it from
there. Once you have it installed,
just open it, log in with your work
account. And then you're gonna come to,
to this first page to create some reports.
You are gonna want to get some data.
So that's the first option we see here.
You're gonna see your recent sources
down here and access to different
tutorials on power BI. If you have time,
make sure you check these out as well.
Now I'm just gonna close this and
introduce you quickly to the I here,
but just so that we can zoom in, I'm
gonna make my screen smaller.  
So the first place we land on
is the report tab right here.
But first we need to add
data to create any reports.
It's asking us whether we wanna import
it from Excel, SQL, and some other common
data sources. If you don't
find your data source here,
you can can get data from another source.
And it's gonna bring up this popup
where you get a list of all common data
sources, and you can see
you have a lot of options.
You also have these in categories so we
can select file. We see Excel workbook,
text CSV, and so on under other,
you can import data from the
web, share point, ODATA feed and
lots of different options. In this case,
my data is in Excel and
it's also in a text CSV.
So we're gonna be importing two data sets.
One is our invoice file,
which is a text file.
And the other one is our customer master
data. That one comes in as Excel file.
I'm gonna start off with the invoice
data. So I'm gonna click on text,
CSV and connect. You can
browse for your file here,
mine right here on the
desktop. Let's open it.
This is gonna open up
a preview of your data.
Now you can decide if you directly
wanna load it to power BI,
or if you wanna form
this. Now, in most cases,
you're gonna want to transform this
because you wanna make sure that your data
is recognized correctly by
power BI. So for example,
your numbers are properly
recognized as numbers.
Your dates are proper dates,
and sometimes you might want to
clean up the data or add new columns.
You can do that. If you
go to transform data.
Now this view here is
the power query editor.
And if you are using Excel and
you're using power query there,
this is the same power query
that you have in Excel.
Notice the headers are automatically
recognized properly as headers.
They're not inside our
data, but they got promoted.
So power query automatically
applied the steps.
Because this is how the data looked first.
Then it automatically promoted the
headers and it changed the data types.
So it tried to recognize whether
we are dealing with a number here.
We can see that with this. I
con this is a whole number,
or we are dealing with text. It's
good practice to go through these,
to make sure that your values
have the proper data types.
This is going to minimize errors.
Once you start your reporting. Now,
in this case, it's fine.
I have sales as a whole number
while I'll just update that to the
see format. So it looks like I have no
decimals here, but maybe in the future,
my sales values will have sense in
it. I don't want them to be cut off.
So I'm gonna change this
to the currency data type.
Another thing I wanna do is to
combine these three columns together
because currently I have years
separately, month and day separately,
I get a date column. Having
a date column is a necessity.
If you want to do any type of time
intelligence analysis in power BI.
So it's super easy to do that here. You
just have to select these three columns.
I'm gonna select month first because
my regional settings are us regional
settings, then day and then year. Right
mouse click and merge columns. For the separator
I'll go with slash, call this
date and click on, okay.
Now I'm not done here because
the date has a text data type.
That's not correct. I'm gonna
adjust this to the date data type.
Now notice all of my steps
are, are registered here.
So every time I upload a new
file with the latest data,
all these steps are automatically
gonna be applied to that data set.
Okay? So that's it for
the invoice data file.
Now let's also upload the customer
master data. So you can just right mouse
click here and add a new query to this.
Or you can make your selection
from the ribbon up here.
My master data is an Excel workbook
and it's right here, customer master,
click and open again.
We're gonna see a preview
of what's inside the file.
Now inside the file, I have a table.
You can see that with this icon,
and this is the sheet.
So if you click on these,
you get to see the review on this side.
Now it's always best practice
to go with the table.
If you have tables in your file,
this way you can avoid numbers that
might just show up on this sheet that you
don't want imported, then click
on, okay, let's check what we get.
So we have customer ID. That's a whole
number. This is text. Customer name.
We have a lot of information about
the customer here and we have
city province.
So it would be great to split city and
province into two separate columns. Well,
you can do that easily with power
query. Right mouse click, split column,
and split column by because
if you take a closer look,
the logic is that the province is inside
the brackets. So we're gonna go with,
by now. It already picked it up.
I'm just gonna add a space before that
and then decide whether I want it at each
occurrence of the, or the left
most steel. Now, in this case,
I just have one bracket here.
So it doesn't really matter.
I'm just gonna go with, okay.
And I get the city in the
first column and the province
in the second column, just gonna double
click here and rename this to city.
Now the province has that
extra ending bracket.
We wanna remove that. So let's
select the column, right mouse,
click and replace value. So
notice with the right mouse click,
you get a lot of common options that
you're gonna need when it comes to
transforming your data. You can also get
to these options from the menu up here,
the value to find is the closing bracket.
We're gonna replace it with
nothing and click on, okay.
And this now is our province.
I'm also gonna rename the query name
to just master customer and presenter.
What I also wanna do is remove columns
that I don't need in my detail model.
Now you can just highlight a column
and press delete if you don't need it.
But since I have a lot of columns here,
don't wanna scroll back and forth.
I'm gonna go to choose columns and choose
the ones that I actually wanna keep.
So I definitely wanna keep customer ID
because this is what connects this table
to my sales table. The ones I don't
need is this one, the phone number,
fax number, website, and delivery method.
So I'm gonna uncheck these, click
on okay and I can see a removed
other column step was added to this.
Now all of these steps are recorded.
Every time a new master
data is uploaded here.
These steps are automatically gonna be
applied. If you did something wrong,
you wanna remove a step,
just click on the X here.
Or if you wanna insert a step,
you can just go back to a previous step
and do what you want on this data set.
And it's gonna insert a
step in between. Okay?
So now that we have our
files uploaded here,
let's go and apply this
so close and apply.
And it's gonna load the data into power BI, into the data model.
So now that the data's there,
we are ready to build the visuals,
but not so fast. Let's check
where our data actually went.
So we can see our fields here. All
the columns are organized in order.
This is our invoice data, and
this is our master customer data.
The connection between the two here
is the customer code and customer
ID. So instead of merging the tables
to bring over all the other customer
information that we need
to the invoice data file,
we are going to use relationships
and connect these together, right?
So that's the better approach.
That's why we have relationships down
here and notice that that relationship
was automatically set up for me.
How did it know what to do? Well,
power BI is smart enough and it recognized
that customer ID and customer code
seemed to be the same thing. This
is the look up table, and this is,
is the fact table. And it automatically
set up that connection for me.
And I did that because I have a setting
enabled in my options that does that
automatically. And I can
show it to you right here.
It's under file options and
settings under data load.
I have a check mark for auto
detect new relationships.
After data is loaded. In
case you don't have that,
you are gonna want to create your own
relationship manually. From this view,
all you have to do is click on the one
side and drag with your mouse to the other
side. And it's automatically gonna
insert a relationship for you. Now,
what if you wanna get back to your data?
What if you forgot to add a step
or you need to split some other
columns? You're gonna see your
data here in the data tab.
If you ever wanna go back to power query
one way of doing that, just write mask,
click here and edit your
query. You're gonna come back.
You can insert new steps or update
anything that you might have forgotten.
So now that we have our data loaded
and we have our relationship set up,
let's go and start to create some reports.
Creating visuals is
really easy in power BI.
You just have to select what you
want. So let's say as a first step,
I wanna analyze sales
by this one right here,
which is customer category name.
So I'm just gonna place a check.
Mark beside these and power BI are
automatically inserted a column chart.
If I don't want a column chart,
I can just adjust that selection
from the visualizations right here.
So I want to get a clustered bar
chart instead, and that's it.
I don't have to do anything special,
but just click on what I want. Now.
This is summarizing the data for
all the years. I don't want that.
I wanna add a filter for year.
I wanna add that as a slicer.
So if you just take a closer look at the
visuals to see what they are and what
options you have, you're gonna come across
this one. That's called slicer. Now,
if I click on it right now,
it's gonna change that visual that I
just made to the visual that I select,
because it's gonna think
that you wanna adjust this.
So make sure before you make a selection
for something new, you click away. Now,
I'm just gonna press
control + Z to go back.
I'm gonna click to the side
here and insert a slicer.
So this time I started
with the visual first.
Now I need to decide what do
I want to have on the slicer?
So here you have some options that you
can adjust. Well, I wanna add date,
but notice there is this arrow on the
side, meaning that I have more options.
So power BI went ahead and
automatically added a date hierarchy
to my single date column, because I
wanna add a slicer just for a year.
I'm gonna select that and it's
automatically gonna add it here. Now,
this is one way of looking at dates
to notice. Whenever I'm updating this,
this visual gets updated as
well. I'm not a fan of this view.
We can change that. Click
on the options right here.
You can decide if you wanna
have a list like this,
or if you wanna have a dropdown.
So I'm gonna go with a dropdown,
make this smaller, drag it
and place it somewhere on top.
Now, when I click on this dropdown,
I can select which year I want
and my here adjusts automatically.
Now, if you wanna change the look of this,
you can do that with these options as
well. So if you take a closer look,
this is the formatting option. Here
you can decide if you want
to show or hide the axis.
If you wanna add data labels,
I'm gonna turn this one off.
You have options for color position,
and so on. You can adjust the title.
I'll just call this
sales by category again,
adjust the alignment size
and so on. So as you can see,
you have lots of options here and
automatically you also get this tool tip.
So when you hover over
each of, of these columns,
you get a better glimpse of the data.
Now I just wanna hide these
access labels as well.
So let's go back to Y axis
and turn off the title for
this one, and also turn off
the title for the X axis.
Okay? So this looks much cleaner. Now,
if you wanna change the
color of this again,
you can go back to the
options under data colors.
You can adjust the color
directly from here. Next up.
Let's add a table that shows our sales
value by month and does a year on
year percentage change calculation,
and also a year to date calculation.
So we're gonna do time
intelligence analysis without
writing a single function.
Check this out.
I'm just gonna click to the side here
and go and grab this table visual.
Let's drag it up here. I wanna get month
in there. So just place a check mark,
and then I wanna have sales value. Okay?
So that shows me the sales
value for each month.
I want to get the comparison to previous year.
If you wanna do this without writing
the function from scratch, you
can. You just go here and click
on quick measure here for
calculations, scroll down
to time intelligence and
you, you have some options.
I wanna get a year over year change.
Now I have to select my base value here.
It's sales and a field for date.
My date field is right here. I'm gonna
click that and drag it in this box.
If you get an error at this stage
that speaks your date column,
doesn't have that calendar
icon in front of it.
This calendar icon has automatically
created a calendar table
for you behind the scenes.
That's why we automatically got
these additional breakdowns.
Now it's good practice to add a
separate calendar table yourself,
to the data model, especially if you're
dealing with different fact tables.
And each of those fact tables
has its own date columns, right?
So you wanna have a separate
calendar table in your model,
but if you're just getting started with
power BI and you wanna test things out,
or you have a simple model,
you can use this option. Okay?
So I'm gonna click on, okay.
And formula got automatically
added by power BI.
You don't even have to look
at this. You can ignore this.
You can of course check your numbers
to see that they are giving the right
result. So with this selected,
I'm gonna place a check mark here,
and I'm gonna get my year over
year percentage calculation. Now,
if you don't have that calendar
icon, how do you get it? Well,
I have that option ticked here.
So you have to go to
options under data load.
You have this auto date time for new
files and here for the current file.
It's also checkmark. So auto date
time for time intelligence, right?
So if you wanna get that,
you have to place a check mark
here to at that calendar icon.
Now a lot of advanced power BI users
have that unchecked because they create
their own calendar tables. Okay.
So just remember that option is
there just check market or uncheck it
depending on your requirements. Now,
next up let's also get sales year to date.
So this time I'm gonna add a
quick measure in a different way.
I'm gonna go to my base
measure here. Right
mouse click and add a new quick measure.
Scroll down to time intelligence
and select year to date total,
because I made my selection from here.
It automatically put the sales
field as my base value. Now,
all I have to do is the
find my date column.
So I'm just gonna click and drag
it here and then click on, okay.
And add this to my table as well. Okay.
So this part is done next up. Let's
visualize our sales by province.
I'm just gonna click to decide
here, click on this map chart icon,
add sales as my KPI and province
from the customer master
data. And you can see immediately
that these ones got highlighted.
So I can scroll with my mouse
hover over any of these states.
I get to see the state name and the
sales that's associated with that.
Now the great thing about using filters
in power BI is that it's not just a
slicer, just acting as a filter.
But if I click for example,
on supermarket here, I can
see my data in my table,
as well as my map chart
is getting sliced as well.
So this way I can quickly see which
states are in these super market
category to remove the filter.
You can just double click on the
white area here and it's removed. Now.
That's not just for this visual
here. You can do that for any visual.
If I click on April, everything
is filtered to April.
If I click on a specific state here,
everything is filtered down
as well for our last visual.
Let's add a line chart for quantity
by month, select line chart,
place a check mark beside quantity
and a check mark beside month.
And that's it. We are done.
You can add a header to this report
by inserting a text box type in your
text, adjust the format thing as you need
and place your text box.
On top of your report,
you also have KPI cards that
you can add to your report.
So let's say one KPI that we wanna
track and we wanna see is quantity.
So I'm just gonna select that is
gonna insert it on top of the other.
We adjust the size and drag
it and put it to the side of
my report. Okay? So you can customize
this in many different ways.
If you wanna add more pages,
you can add more pages here.
Now this way I can filter,
take a look at 2020, my year on year
percentage changes, my sales year to date
updates as well. Take a look at 2018.
And if I get new data,
all I have to do is replace the current
invoice text file with the new invoice
text file, and then click on refresh
and everything is updated automatically.
In case you need to do more complex
calculations that you can't find in.
The quick measure are gonna need to
write your own measures by clicking on
new measure. To be able
to write correct measures
you need to learn the DAX formula
language. Now just like with Excel,
if you are familiar with Excel formulas,
there is basic and there is advanced.
So with just basic DAX,
you can already do a
lot of complex analysis.
That's a topic for another video.
So I'm just gonna rename
this double click,
call it report and let's save our file.
So go to file and save, give
it a name and save the file.
If you wanna share your report with
others so that they can interact with the
report, you're gonna want to publish,
just go to publish right here
and select a destination.
This is gonna publish it
to the power BI service.
I'm just gonna publish mine
to reports, click and select,
and it's publishing it to power
BI. It might take some time.
Once it's done, you're gonna see the
success message right here to open it.
You can directly click on this link.
It's gonna open up the browser and take
you to your report on the web here.
You can interact with the report
on the web because check this out.
We are on power bi.com. So if you're
logged into your office account,
you can just type in powerbi.com
and you can access your reports
directly from the web.
You have the option to share
the report with others as well,
either people in your
organization, specific people,
people with existing access and so on.
You can also adjust
some settings down here.
Now you can also share this
report in teams, right?
So depending on the rights
and where you publish it,
you can add this report as
a separate tab in teams.
So over here in teams,
I'm gonna go to this general channel
and add a new tab for power BI.
It's gonna up my workspaces,
select the report that I just made
and save it as a separate tab.
All the interactivity that we saw before
is there. You can switch the years.
You can filter by selecting an option
from any of your visuals here as
well. This wraps up our introduction to
power BI. So as you probably noticed,
just from looking at those available
functionalities that were in the menu,
there is a lot you can do in power BI.
There's a lot of different options that
you have for importing and cleaning your
data.
There is a lot to relationships and
writing your own DAX functions to do
more complex calculations that you need for your data analysis. Now,
the great thing is if you're using
power query and power pivot in Excel,
you can easily apply that
knowledge to power BI as well.
So it's much easier to get
started. That's it for today.
I hope you enjoyed this tutorial.

channel in case you aren't
subscribed already.
Thank you for watching and I'm
gonna see you in the next video.
