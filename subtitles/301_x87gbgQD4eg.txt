you want to know how bad you are at
security in this video i'm going to show
you one of the best tools at discovering
security vulnerabilities

alright let's get into the video when
was the last time that you had to
install
updates on your computer one of the
things that will always be consistent in
security
is that new bugs and vulnerabilities are
found every day
being able to identify vulnerabilities
or weaknesses in our networks
and track them throughout their life
cycle until they're resolved
is crucial to keeping a network secure
after all attackers have the same
bulletins
and vulnerability release information
that we do so it becomes a race to fix
that vulnerability
before an attacker can exploit it have
you ever heard of the cis controls
the cis controls are critical controls
that an organization
needs to secure their network continuous
vulnerability management
happens to be the number three critical
control that an organization has to have
on their network
if you haven't heard of the top 20
controls what you can do is go to
ciisecurity.org
and they have a list of all the
different controls if you want to look
more into this
but right here at number three we have
continuous
vulnerability management let's be honest
as you'll begin to see the vulnerability
management life cycle
can take a lot of time and resources in
order to be successful
we have to know the systems that we have
on our networks then we have to go scan
those systems and identify
vulnerabilities
we have to determine the vulnerability
severity
so how likely it is to be exploited and
then we actually have to track that
vulnerability
through its remediation luckily there's
commercial tools that exist to assist us
in the vulnerability management process
in this particular video
we're going to cover nessus which is a
popular vulnerability scanning tool
nessus has two different components that
make it actually work
first we have the client and this refers
to that web interface that we actually
use
as the administrators or users and we
can interact with the system
the schedule scans generate reports and
all kinds of other features
the other component is the server
component this is what actually performs
those scans
and then it sends the results over to
the web interface or the client
with vulnerability scanning there's four
major steps
the first step is port scanning this is
where the scanner is going to actually
go out there determine which hosts are
alive
and which ports are open on those hosts
then we have service detection
this is where nessus is going to send
out probes to find out which
application is running on that port the
version number
and the actual name of it then we have
vulnerability identification
this is where nessus is going to compare
what it discovers about each service
detected on each host
and then it's going to actually compare
it against its database
of known vulnerabilities of those
applications and version numbers
and then finally we have the probing
step this is where nessus is
actually going to try to further
identify if there's false positives
or identify if that vulnerability
actually exists
now that we know some of the basics
about vulnerability management and
vulnerability scanning
i want to actually take you through the
nessus product by installing it
and running some scans so you can
actually see what it looks like
for this demo we're going to be using
the free non-commercial use
license that you can also use at home if
you want to practice along
before we get started i want to make
sure that we're on the same page as far
as a disclaimer
so everybody say it with me i will not
scan
networks that i do not have written
permission
to scan okay we agree
if you scan networks that you do not
have permission
to scan you can actually get into a lot
of legal trouble
so make sure that you're only scanning
systems that you have permission to scan
all right so let's go over to the
computer now so we can install nessus
so the first thing that you're going to
want to do is go to google
and search for nessus
and nessus is made by tenable which is
the producing company here
we'll click this first link
and the nessus essentials is the one
that we're actually going to use for our
home use
you can see that there's a few other
options that you would use in an actual
corporate environment
we'll scroll down here and we'll go to
download
so you will have to actually register to
get an activation code from them
so i will go ahead and do this and then
i'll check back in once we enter our
information
it will take us to the download page and
then we just have to pick the version
that we want to use
accept the terms and go ahead install
i am running centos here so yours might
look different depending on which
operating system you're running
but again we're going to install it
i'll enter my password here
and now that we have it installed we
need to go ahead and start it
up here so i already have a command
prompt window open back here
and so i will change to root
and start the service
all right great so nessus is started now
so when you're actually going to connect
to nessus after you've installed it
you need to go to your local host and
then port 8834 is the website you'll get
this
error because it doesn't have an
official signed certificate
so hit advanced
and then add exception and confirm
security exception
now we'll be brought to this webpage
where we need to select our specific
version
again we did nessus essentials so
continue
and then we already have an activation
code so
we can skip this step and we'll enter
our activation
in here so i'm going to enter mine in
and then hit continue
and then i'll check back in once we're
done with that now that we've entered
our activation code we need to create a
user account
so i'm going to create the username root
and the password will be super secret
and then hit submit
now this account is the account that
you'll log into when you need to run a
scan
what it's going to do now is it's going
to go ahead and download the plugins
it's going to update itself
so that we have all the available
signatures
and the most up-to-date database for
when we perform our scans
so we will let this run and then we'll
check back in once we're done with that
all right and now we have successfully
installed
nessus to our local system with the
nessus essential license
i hope that you're enjoying the content
in this video so far
if you are make sure to hit the thumbs
up to like this video
and if you think of any questions let me
know down in the comment section below
also remember that this training and
full courses can be found on my website
at johngood.com without distracting
interruptions
or advertisements all right let's get
back to the content
so now that we've installed nessus the
first thing that we need to do
is we need to actually run a discovery
scan it's called
and this is going to discover all the
hosts on our network
so i'm actually only going to scan the
localhost
because that's this system right now
that i'm running this on
so i'll enter the ip address and hit
submit
and nessus will go ahead and scan for
potential hosts
it finds my host so if we used a full
network
or mini host then it would obviously
list them in here
but again with this home license you
only have a 16 host limit
that you can scan and then we will hit
run scan
all right and this is going to do a
basic network scan
all right now that scan is complete so
we can actually drill down
into the different vulnerabilities that
it found
it will tell you some of the information
early on before it actually finishes
so you can look at the information
before it finishes
but you can see here that we have this
nice pie chart here
92 percent of the findings were
informational
six percent were medium two percent were
low
so if we want to drill down into that we
can go up here and click the
vulnerabilities
and it will tell us the individual
issues
so we're going to go into this http
issue here
and we can see there's a medium
vulnerability and we're going to click
on that one
you can see that it gives more
information about that individual
vulnerability
and what it found so in this particular
one
this remote web server supports the
trace and or track methods
with this i just installed a default
installation of apache
so it's going to have some of these
regular default findings
in this vulnerability finding you can
also see this output so it gives more
information about it
and you also get some article links you
can go check out as well
the medium rating or the medium risk is
based on
what nessus believes it is okay
so that's where that medium comes from
then you also
get modified and the published date
so you can see when they updated the
signature
and just a little bit more information
you also get the port that it was found
on
so adtcp www and the host that it was
found on so again localhost
this system that i'm actually running it
on now you also get
some of these cves over here as well so
if i click on this original one go ahead
and open that in a different window
that will take us to the actual database
where it describes its findings
and i definitely would check this out
this is going to be a great database
where you have a lot of different
information this is the nist
nvd website and this has all the
different
vulnerabilities that are out there oh
and again
that was found for the specific
vulnerability the specific
cve you found it on the actual
vulnerability finding
it links directly to it when you're
looking for more vulnerability
information
you can also go to the vendor website
because of course they're going to
release
when there's a new patch and potential
security issues
and that's in addition to what we can
use on the scanner
and that national vulnerability database
which is that website i showed you
by nist question of the day what are
some alternative tools to nessus
or vulnerability management that exist
out there i want you to actually go out
and do some research
and let me know down in the comment
section below what some of these
alternative tools are
in this video we walk through the
installation operation
and reporting in the nessus
vulnerability scanning tool
we also went through different ways that
you can research
vulnerabilities their severity and ways
to actually mitigate them
or remove them from our environments
remember vulnerability management is a
very
time-consuming and ongoing process that
only works when we can track the
vulnerabilities that exist
through their mitigation or when we
actually eliminate them from our
networks
