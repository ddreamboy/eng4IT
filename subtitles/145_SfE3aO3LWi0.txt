what's up guys Wale here welcome back to the 
channel in today's video i'm gonna be talking  
about some of the different competencies 
and resources that can be helpful for people  
that have no data analysis experience and are 
interested in getting started in learning data  
analysis recently i was discussing with a friend 
who is quite interested in data analysis and i was  
asking him what tool he planned on learning first 
and his answer was python and i asked why python  
and he says because it's the hottest tool right 
now and everyone is talking about it so i know  
there's a lot of buzz around learning python to 
be a data analyst and it's easy to get carried  
away with that buzz but try not to get carried 
away rather you want to see through the noise  
and find a tool that suits your style and then 
you can gradually build competence around that  
too so i'm going to provide some options to some 
resources which are going to be free extremely  
beginner friendly and i'm going to focus on the 
core competencies to get you started generally  
there are four main areas to build competence 
in data analysis and very broadly i list them as  
data querying that are cleaning analyzing data 
using statistical or non-statistical methods  
and data visualizations so as a data analyst 
you'll be required to be knowledgeable using  
one or a combination of microsoft excel 
sql tableau or power bi python or r
the reason why microsoft excel is first on 
the list is because if you work in a corporate  
organization or plan to work in a corporate 
organization most of the data analysis tasks  
you will do will be on microsoft excel typically 
your colleagues will send you an excel file  
to work with and it might be unnecessary 
and sometimes inconvenient to switch  
into python to do an analysis that can be 
done using excel as a beginner data analyst  
it is important to learn microsoft excel 
and you should really be aiming to become  
knowledgeable in areas involving the use of 
salt and filter vlookups pivot tables formulas  
and basic data cleaning methods to master excel 
for an absolute beginner here are the courses  
i would recommend introduction to data analysis 
using excel you'll find this course on edx it's  
a free course for four weeks where you learn 
how to use pivot tables aggregate functions  
in basic knowledge of formulas cell referencing 
and many more after taking this course then you  
can jump into the next course which is also an edx 
which is analyzing and visualizing data with excel  
here you'll learn how to import data from 
different sources using power query manipulate  
your data using dax formulas and prepare for data 
analysis into power bi one major limitation with  
excel is it's limited to one million rows of 
data so when working with large set of data it  
starts to become slow and might crash on you a 
few times but if your job does not require huge  
data set then microsoft excel is good enough 
nonetheless i cannot deny the huge demand for  
data analysts with sql and tablet skills so i 
get the need for picking those skills up as well
sql is a language that lets you as a 
data analyst interact with a database  
a database is a collection of 
data stored in a computer system  
usually large volumes of data where accessing 
it requires some form of structured coding  
as a data analyst you might be required to 
run sql queries and to do so you must first  
understand the basis of relational database 
and structure specifically things like primary  
key foreign key relationships between tables 
then you go ahead and learn sql functions like  
select statement from statement where statement 
group by order by joins area you want to master  
for learning sql again you can check out this edx 
course on sql it's called sql for data science  
alternatively you can check out khan academy's sql 
course called intro to sql querying and managing
data the third competence to learn is either one 
of tab u or power bi i just finished learning  
tableau and what i discovered was it's not so much 
different from power bi you do basically the same  
thing which is to visualize large data sets and 
the cool thing about both 2 is you can import  
your data directly from sql or a csv file or 
any other database to create your visualizations  
at this point because you're already 
familiar with visualizations using excel  
it becomes super easy to understand how 
to use either one of tablet or power bi  
to learn power bi once again head over to edx 
enroll for the analyzing and visualizing data with  
power bi costs in this course you'll 
learn how to identify different types  
of data visualizations and how to create 
fully functional reports and dashboards  
now finally python as a data analyst python is 
used to manipulate data similar to what you do  
on sql python is also used in data science for 
highly mathematical and statistical analysis when  
using python what you're really learning is how to 
use statistics to analyze data remember my friend  
who's learning how to use python so far he's 
gotten a hang of some of the theoretical concepts  
however there is the practical side which he is 
currently struggling with and by practical side  
i mean how do you know what sort of problems or 
challenges that should be solved using statistics  
not all analysis requires statistics and that's 
something you must be aware of as a data analyst  
so some of the basic statistical concepts 
you should be aware of or you should know  
are sampling frequency distribution mean media 
mode measures of variability standard deviation  
probability significant testing z-scores 
confidence intervals and a b testing all these  
can be learned and practiced using microsoft excel 
data analysis 2-pack even before picking up python  
class so if you ask me learning python is quite 
optional which is the whole essence of this video  
i do not want people to feel they have to learn 
python or r to become data analyst trust me i know  
data analysts that have worked solely on excel 
and they are fine even right now as a data analyst  
most of the work that i do is a microsoft excel 
and to really show you this here is a data analyst  
role on Andela Andela is a renowned technology 
slash i.t talent pool company in Africa and  
let's jump straight to the requirements for this 
role here you have must have deep understanding  
of statistics have strong excel skills have 
experience with sql and database management  
have experience with any statistical analysis 
package such as excel spss and sas so the bottom  
line is you can be a data analyst with the 
simple tools at your disposal start with excel  
move over to sql if you need to try 
your hands on different visualizations  
tab your power bi if you're really curious and 
you want to take it a step higher by all means use  
python at the end of the day as long as you can 
use the tool to get the job done then fantastic
you must find ways to apply your knowledge in 
specific projects to deepen your experience  
and showcase your skills without projects you will 
not be able to retain what you've learned for long  
cargo.com is one place to download some 
data sets and play around with them  
apply the knowledge you've learned and experiment 
with different visualizations it will help  
increase your confidence levels significantly 
all right if you have any questions do leave

be happy to answer them and if this video
