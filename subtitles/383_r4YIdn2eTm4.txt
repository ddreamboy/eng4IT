hello everyone
today we're going to talk about aws in
10 minutes
let's look at the agenda here
let's talk about what aws is
why it's such a big hit
we'll have a look at the overview of the
services we'll see how much it costs
how big it is
and what the future of aws is
so
what is aws
everyone is talking about amazon web
services but let's have a look at what
it is
it's basically a global cloud platform
which allows you to host and manage
services on the internet
it's used by almost eighty percent of
fortune 500 companies to host their
infrastructure and it has a lot of
services which it provides to its
customers
there's infrastructure service which
means they provide bare servers as a
service so you don't need to manage the
backup and the power supply of the
service
they provide platform of the service
you can get java ruby php as a service
so that you don't have to manage the
binaries of these applications
you get software as a service wherein
you get email sending capabilities like
ses
you get queuing services like sqs and
it's a cloud storage platform wherein
you have a lot of storage options
including ebs and s3 so all in all aws
is a hosting provider which gives you a
lot of services wherein you can run your
applications on the cloud
now let's take a look at why it's such a
big hit
so everyone is trying to use aws
everyone is trying to put their
applications on the cloud
so what's the reason that aws is the top
provider and the top choice for doing
anything on the cloud
one of the biggest reasons is the
billing
so the billing is very clear you get a
per hour billing
every instance or every service has a
micro billing so be it instances on ec2
you get per hour billing rate which is
very transparent
even s3 buckets are charged on a per gb
basis although it is a storage service
but still there is micro billing
available there
the sign up process is easy you don't
need to sign any agreement nothing you
just go
sign up with an email id add a credit
card and you're good to go
you can go from zero to 100 in just two
minutes
you can launch your servers big machines
without buying hardware without
procuring any hardware you can just be
up and running in minutes
so their billing dashboard is also very
simple
they give you an integrated billing
dashboard which gives you reports
you can pull out reports every month
you can pull out reports based on
services based on various parameters
for the cloud provider to be a hit you
need it to be stable it has to be a
trusted thing
so their services are quite stable
in the last seven or eight years they
have seen some three or four major
outages but those have been only region
specific
so that means out of the 12 or 13
regions in which they operate the
outages have been region specific in a
particular country or continent and
those also have not been more than two
or three hours and have not affected all
of their customers
it's a trusted vendor so when we talk
about aws it comes up as something which
is used by everyone in the industry
from small startups to big enterprises
everyone sees amazon as a trusted
advisor
now let's have an overview of the most
commonly used services
so the first and the most commonly used
service is ec2 which is elastic compute
cloud
this is the service which gives you bare
servers so this service will give you a
machine which you can launch and you can
run your software on those
you can get small or big machines based
on your requirements
the second choice is vpc
so amazon will not allow you full
control of their cloud instead they give
you chunks of their cloud which is vpc
or the virtual private cloud
so vpc lets you create networks in the
cloud and then run your servers in those
networks
the next one is s3 which is simple
storage service
so s3 gives you the opportunity to
upload and share files so it is mostly a
file storage and sharing service
then you've got rds which is relational
database service
so this rds allows you to run and manage
databases on the cloud so they've got
almost all the major flavors of
databases right from sql server to
oracle and mysql postgresql
they have recently launched another one
which is called aurora which claims to
be a very high performance database then
route 53 is there for dns
so they've got a managed dns service
wherein you can point your dns to amazon
and they take care of the stuff
so it's a global dns service it's a
scalable dns service so it scales
according to demand
there's also elastic load balancer the
elb is a service which gives you the
opportunity to load balance incoming
traffic to multiple machines so this way
you can skill up your web applications
to any number of users
you've got auto scaling which adds
capacity on the fly to elastic load
balancers so that your website or your
application is never down due to a load
how much does it cost this per our
billing is already mentioned for
everything if it's something like a
storage thing again there's a per hour
or per gb month storage
so i think there is region specific
pricing so virginia is the cheapest
region out of all of them
so the region's specific pricing is
because they have got some regions which
they have got good hold of and they are
the headquarters so oregon and virginia
are the cheapest actually
they also give you services based on the
term so if you sign up for something for
a year it would be cheaper for you
rather than signing up for something on
an on-demand basis so they've got
reserved instances which are very cheap
as compared to the on-demand ones you
can get discounts from twenty percent to
almost sixty percent if you sign up for
a three-year term
they are spot resources examples of
these are spot instances
so this is like a bidding market base
where you can bid for a price
the only downside of this kind of
pricing is that your machine might be
terminated or your resources might be
terminated if someone bids higher
people use these kind of things for
doing some ad hoc in search or some ad
hoc tasks which are really not critical
how big is it
they have got 15 regions across major
countries of the world
they've got regions in the us europe
asia pacific
they've got a global footprint so in
today's world if you are anywhere in the
world you would have a region within 1
000 miles of your location they've got
massive data centers so each of the
region has got multiple availability
zones so one availability zone can be
thought of as a big data center
the data centers have anywhere from
three hundred thousand to five hundred
thousand servers
what is the future of aws
so they currently have 64 services which
span across infrastructural service
software as a service platform as a
service
they are launching new services in all
demands every day
right now they are focusing on machine
learning
so recently they've launched a couple of
services which focus exclusively on
machine learning and they are focusing
on software as a service product wherein
they want to take control of the service
you want to utilize
they don't want you to do it they want
you to upload it to them
and every now and then they keep on
reducing the costs so you would hear it
in the blog that okay the price of ec2
machines has been reduced
and this is because of their scale so
they scale up and they give the cost
benefit to the customer
that's all for today guys with just a
