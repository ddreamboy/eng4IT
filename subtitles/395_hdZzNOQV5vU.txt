until recently access to the internet
was limited via devices like the desktop
tablet or smartphone but now with the
internet of things aka iot practically
all appliances can be connected to the
internet and monitored remotely
it is a system of interconnected devices
that transfer data
over a wireless network without any
human intervention
so hey everyone welcome to this iot
tutorial video
in this video we help you understand
what iot is and how it is impacting our
day-to-day life
we will also understand the iot
architecture and look at the new
trending iot projects for 2021.
but before that if you haven't
subscribed to our channel already make
sure to hit the subscribe button and the
bell icon to never miss an update
i'm sure you're excited to learn so
let's dive right in
imagine you're at work and realize that
you might not have turned off the air
conditioner while leaving your house
instead of traveling all the way back
home what if you could use your
smartphone to know the status of your ac
and perhaps even turn it off
wouldn't that be amazing
well yes
and this can be achieved with the help
of the internet of things
until recently access to the internet
was limited via devices like the desktop
tablet or smartphone but now with iot
practically all appliances can be
connected to the internet and monitored
remotely iot is shaping the way we live
our lives it helps us get a better
insight into the working of things
around us
so what exactly is the internet of
things
iot is a system of interrelated devices
connected to the internet to transfer
and receive data from one to the other a
smart home is the best example of iot
home appliances like the ac doorbell
thermostats smoke detectors water
heaters and security alarms can be
interconnected to share data with the
user over a mobile application
the user can now get detailed insight
into the working of the devices around
him
think about it until recently the
internet helped people connect and
interact with each other but now
inanimate objects or things have the
ability to sense the surroundings to
interact and collaborate with one
another
for example
in the morning when your alarm goes off
the iot system can open the window
blinds turn on the coffee pot for you
and even turn on the water heater
although all of this is fascinating
there's a lot that goes on in the
background to ensure seamless
functioning from effective communication
between devices to accurate processing
of the data received a lot of components
are involved
in the context of iot devices hardware
can be classified into general devices
and sensing devices the general devices
are the main components of the data hub
and information exchange
they are connected either by wired or
wireless interfaces home appliances are
a classic example of such devices
the sensing devices on the other hand
include sensors and actuators they
measure the temperature humidity light
intensity and other parameters
these iot devices are connected to the
network with the help of gateways
these gateways or processing nodes
process the information collected from
the sensors and transfer it to the cloud
the cloud acts as both the storage and
processing unit actions are performed on
the collected data for further learning
and inferences
wired and wireless interfaces like wi-fi
bluetooth zigbee gsms and so on are used
to provide connectivity to ensure its
ubiquity applications need to support a
diverse set of devices and communication
protocols from tiny sensors capable of
sensing and reporting the desired factor
to powerful backend servers that are
utilized for data analysis and knowledge
extraction
to help you understand it's working
let's take a simple scenario
let's suppose you want to water your
garden every time the moisture level in
the soil drops
instead of doing it manually you could
automate it using iot
the sensors and actuators installed
gauge the soil for its moisture this
information is sent to the iot gateway
with the help of communication protocols
like mqtt or http the gateway
significantly aggregates data and feeds
it to the cloud with the help of wi-fi
lan
once the moisture level drops the system
is immediately triggered and the
sprinklers are turned on however with
the information stored in the cloud a
detailed analysis like the time of the
day the sprinkler was turned on the rate
at which the moisture in the soil
reduces and so on can be done and the
report could be sent over to you on your
smartphone over an app
with the improved response monitoring
and analytical capabilities iot is being
adopted in almost all industries and
domains opening doors to endless
applications
today iot is being used extensively to
lessen the burden on humans to name a
few iot is deployed for smart homes
wearables watches and bracelets smart
cars
smart farming smart retail smart grids
smart city and smart health care
with such a wide spectrum of
applications the future of i.t looks
more promising than ever before
in 2018 there were about 23 billion
connected devices which was more than
double the world population
according to experts there will be over
80 billion devices by 2025. iot is a
vision to connect all devices with the
power of the internet always learning
and always growing
now that you have a picture of what iot
is here's a simple question for you
which of the following technologies is
not used as an interface for a network
one wi-fi
two ethernet
three
zigbee
four
vpn

the integration of iot with other
technologies like cloud computing
machine learning and artificial
intelligence is paving the way for many
new and exciting innovations
and that is the internet of things for
you in short
the first wave of the internet
revolution came in with the growth of
personal computers and in the second
wave the internet came right onto our
palms that is with the advent of mobile
devices and here we are leaving the
third wave where all electronic devices
are almost already connected to the
internet or will be in the near future
yes the internet of things will bring
about the next industrial revolution and
will drastically transform the way we
live and experience technology today
quite possibly the internet of things
will be as disruptive as the internet
itself particularly when combined with
big data and predictive analytics
but what exactly is iot the concept
behind iot is about connecting just
about everything to the internet in real
time which directly improves our quality
of life and experiences
for instance how are you watching this
video right now on a pc a mobile or a
tablet well whichever device you're
using is definitely connected to the
internet and that means you're already
using an iot device
sensors are becoming the end points of
iot networks wondering what exactly a
sensor is
these sensors collect an increasing
amount of context aware data and
information such as location images
weather conditions and inject them into
networks actuators and applications in
real time
big data analytics and predictions have
become apparent synonymous helping
perform and execute tasks seamlessly
with minimal to zero errors
are you ready to admit a major
breakthrough
life in the present is great but the
future looks like it could be way more
exciting how we may ask
since there are billions of physical
devices around the world that are now
connected to the internet collecting and
sharing data in real time terabytes of
data are going to become better bytes
which represents 1000 terabytes each
there is going to be a shift from
wideband networks to narrowband networks
for better range
and you'll also soon witness the
communication system transcend from 4g
to 5g wireless communications
[Music]
iot will definitely be the paradigm
shift of effective multitasking with
massive applications
now let's have a look at the future with
iot environment
imagine you're driving your smart car to
work and you're quite late don't you
worry because your car can now provide
the shortest route with less congestion
not only that the integrated sensors in
the car alerts you about mechanical
assistance you also have the access to
automatic temperature control and not to
forget in case you're tired or wary the
car becomes self-driven since it comes
with an accident prevention system
[Music]
as you are driving you see the smart
farms through your window farmers are
happier thanks to iot which helped them
with better heat and provided more
efficiency than ever
you might wonder how with the help of
systems like autonomous self-driving
tractors adaptive irrigation systems
soil health monitoring and animal
welfare monitoring systems this is
possible
you also see smart factories which use
iiot that is industrial internet of
things with the help of analytics and
automation systems iiot helps in
tracking goods in real time inventory
management automated delivery system and
much more
now you're returning home from office
your car can park itself automatically
your fingerprint voice or even your
smartphone is enough to control all home
appliances from lights to television and
your door to water taps too are you
excited to experience this smart future
which is not far away of course you
should be
the applications of iot will be seen in
every industry across sectors be it
education healthcare manufacturing
automotive you name it iot is definitely
going to have a role to play in each one
of them
possibly the fourth wave will be the
internet of everything or ioe
which would encompass all physical
things processes data and people through
wearables and surgically implanted
sensors unlike iot which focuses only on
physical devices
change is the only constant and the
world will never be the same with the
growth of ubiquitous connectivity and
iot is sure to change the way billions
of people live their lives today why to
internet of things
as a learner you should learn iot as it
provides better scope for future data
scientists as well as provides for
promising career opportunities
you can also build and manage your own
iot for your home as a company executive
you should learn iot because it will
help you measure everything in the
business you also get real-time metrics
actionable data and better connectivity
across industries
after completing this course you should
be able to explain the concept of
internet of things comprehensive
describe hardware software and other
connectivity building blocks of iot
describe design considerations
pertaining architecture
framework and interoperability
explain the security considerations with
iot pertaining to vulnerabilities
explain industry 4.0 internet to
everything and social iot
and finally describe iot framework in
enterprises
in the context of iot devices hardware
can be divided into two categories
general devices and sensing devices
the general devices do the embedded
processing and connectivity for the
platforms they are connected either by
wired network or wireless interfaces
they are the main component for data
collection and information processing
the current home appliances are classic
example of such devices that are
controlled by a sensor these sensors
help solve common problems
apart from sensors actuators are another
important device in iot that perform
similar functions with different
capabilities they work as interface
between sensors and machines and collect
various information like humidity and
light intensity
this information is computed using the
edge layer which typically sits between
the cloud and the sensor they are the
layers that store the intermittent
transfer of information
finally the backend server of the cloud
processes this information
both the sensors and actuators are the
chief components of iot the sensors
measure temperature humidity light
intensity and other key parameters of
home environment
the second most crucial aspect of iot is
device management platforms or dmps
the dmvs as they are shortly called are
the platforms through which these assets
interact with the software layer through
network gateways dmps come with various
functionalities which include firmware
upgrades security patching and reporting
of metrics they also help develop alert
mechanism for industrial equipment with
more open source os like arduino overall
it is an important aspect of the
management of the device penetration
connectivity blocks connectivity blocks
collectively is considered as the
backbone of an iot setup
there are various connectivity layers
like usb can protocols and modbus
the next generation protocols of wi-fi
are laura and zigbee they can interface
with any application or modules a small
device embedded in an object
the entire landscape is called gateway
architecture
various ports are
232.485 from usb that come with gateway
architecture
the device interface is important for
the data transfer and enables digital
transformation with third-party
applications and systems
communication protocols and standards
let us try to understand the various
communication protocols available to set
up an iot
the first is the satellite this enables
the cell phone communication through an
antenna situated within 10 to 15 miles
they have a stable and universal
connection
the second is the protocol is the wi-fi
and is based on five gigahertz
frequencies
it provides internet access within a
certain range and are an affordable
option
it has well protected protocols
the third is the radio frequency
it is the easiest form of communication
a few examples are zigbee and z-wave
which use low-power rf radio
it consumes low energy which is very
advantageous
it's relatively simple to configure
the fourth in this list is rfid it uses
wireless electromagnetic fields to
identify sensors and objects
good thing about it is that it does not
require power
the fifth is bluetooth which is useful
for short term and short distance data
exchange it is present in every
smartphone and has sensors
the final one is near field
communication or nfc it uses
electromagnetic induction and loop
antennas
it comes with encryption has low speed
communication and is used for short
range data exchange
future of iot connectivity
iot connectivity is the future the
launch of new technologies like 5g
the 5g with low latency and higher
throughput will increase the penetration
of iot
5g cellular technology is supported by
the network for virtualization
even for the common use case such as for
t vendor real-time predictive analytics
can be available
so
overall the delivery time is reduced
with iot
5g and iot are embedded technologies
both can be sliced and diced for
predictive analytics and real-time
business decisions
5g will help devices connect through a
network with high speed bandwidth
iot device architecture
there are four layers in the device
architecture
the base layer consists of iot devices
this includes all the components like
sensors with the ability to sense
compute and connect other devices
let's move on to the second layer which
is the iot gateway or aggregation layer
this layer significantly aggregates data
from various sensors these two layers
form the definition engine and they set
the rules for data aggregation next
layer is based on cloud it's called
processing engine or event processing
layer it has numerous algorithms and
data processing elements that are
ultimately displayed on a dashboard
this layer basically processes the data
obtained from the sensor layer
the last layer is called the application
layer or api management layer it acts as
an interface between third-party
application and infrastructure the
entire landscape is supported by device
managers and identity and access
managers
which are useful for security of the
architecture
many individuals and organizations have
contributed to create and set the
standard it covers the entire network
and endpoint systems it brings a
structural approach with security
controls in place it provides a
demarcation based on its uses for
enterprise to build iot products this
standard has 85 detailed recommendations
and a structured approach that can fit
into any iot ecosystem it has a flexible
framework addressing the diversity of
the technology aligned to the regulation
it also has risk modeling capabilities
for any organization to choose from
including endpoint ecosystems the
standard is very flexible and comes with
the inbuilt risk assessments for any
organization to adapt overall it is an
interesting standard and easy to get
trained at iot security best practices
there are many best practices in iot
security let's look at some best
practices pertaining to iot hardware
first of all the hardware should be
tamper-proof
they should have undergone dynamic
testing with specific data protection
algorithms and should be updated on
firmware and patches
the network components must be authentic
with encryption kernel controls and
division of networks into segments
other security measures include privacy
protection for sensitive information and
other regulations like safe harbor
statements
there are many value drivers to help the
internet of everything
key drivers are employee productivity
supply and logistics
customer experiences
innovation and time to market asset
utilization all the factors are tightly
linked to generate a new revenue gains
for any enterprise
time to market and innovation
this will help with the competitive
index
of the organization
he'll help discover mvp to reduce the
cost of building
and bring improvement in customer
experience
asset utilization is the form of digital
physical and even smart assets the asset
discovery is the requirement for the
establishment of the iot ecosystem
supply chain is also a key value driver
and assesses the requirement of internet
of everything
in addition to the drivers there are
significant elements
the elements stand in four buckets the
first is data which encapsulates sending
and analyzing data
the second bucket is the people
who are always connected and have
contextual subject mapping with the
real-time world for decision making
the third bucket is the things which
link people to machine with endpoints
ibi addresses and sensors
the last bucket is machined to data
which talks with a business value and
action iteration
essentially building simple models to
achieve corporate results
internet of everything growth engine the
internet of everything comes with a
growth engine for any organization it
includes people or the most valuable
resources
the process of making the right effort
the things that includes the physical
devices other objects and the data taken
from sensors to make actionable insights
for decision making is important
people
process
things
and data are the growth engine elements
it gives the company an edge in the
digital transformation world
with data privacy and transparency
mechanism it is important for every
organization to follow internet ethics
and compliance
iot and fleet management
let's discuss some use cases of iot
the fleet management is a classic
example of iot in application in this
domain iot is mainly used to track
vehicles from one point to another
using iot technology the entire fleet
can be monitored with a support of rfid
chips embedded within every car in the
fleet
the same rfid can also be used to track
products such as consumer goods
electronics and food items
you can get real-time information on the
routes that the fleet takes
there are obd devices that can be used
to track vehicles behavior and
performance including fuel consumption
and mileage
this can reduce the total cost and
provide greater return on investment
according to a recent study the iot
market will increase to 8.28 billion
dollars by 2021. sensor's linked
artificial intelligence help the bankers
track all the activities in the back end
the advancements of mobile phones and
digital assistants along with 5g
connectivity makes customer experience
seamless
first and foremost it is data
data is the new oil
financial institutions have structured
and unstructured data of the customers
they can slice and dice the data for
profiling segmentation product launches
and digital services enablement
the data can create a large economic
drive and give rise to new business
models like nfc banking digital
assistance banking and social media
banking
with this transformation internet of
things provides competitive advantage to
the banking insurance and financial
services
while the end goal remains to help
customers save money and give a bundle
offer
let's understand how iot revolutionizes
various industries
with the advent of the internet of
things there are many industries
experiencing digital transformation such
as financial services healthcare
manufacturing communications energy
retail and transportation
iot has initiated changes at all levels
user infrastructure and large-scale
applications analytics with real-time
dashboard and iot support allows
informed decision making for businesses
this also means that iot is introducing
a new revenue model for enterprises
around the world
learning objectives by the end of this
lesson you will be able to
explain the iot architecture and
frameworks describe the iot
interoperability and its design
considerations and discuss
industry-aligned use cases
iot device architecture
there are four layers in the device
architecture the base layer consists of
iot devices
this includes all the components like
sensors with the ability to sense
compute and connect other devices
let's move on to the second layer which
is the iot gateway or aggregation layer
this layer significantly aggregates data
from various sensors these two layers
form the definition engine and they set
the rules for data aggregation next
layer is based on cloud is called
processing engine or event processing
layer it has numerous algorithms and
data processing elements that are
ultimately displayed on a dashboard
this layer basically processes the data
obtained from the sensor layer the last
layer is called the application layer or
api management layer
it acts as an interface between
third-party application and
infrastructure the entire landscape is
supported by device managers and
identity and access managers
which are useful for security of the
architecture
iot reference architecture next let's
learn about the various layers in iot
reference architecture device layer
the device layer is the main component
where there are various devices like
sensors that are interconnected some
examples are bluetooth connected via
mobile phone and zigbee via zigbee
gateway the other devices include the
raspberry pi that's connected to the
ethernet via wi-fi this is directly
connected to the communication layers
which are part of the second layer
communication layer the communication
layer or gateway layer has rest
protocols
and other application level protocols
both layers are tightly coupled and
generate enormous amount of data
now the bus layer or aggregation layer
acts as a message broker it forms a
bridge between the data and the
communication layer for the sensors
this is an important layer for three
reasons it supports an http server and
or a mqtt broker
it aggregates and combines
communications via gateway and it
bridges and transforms data between
different protocols
the next layer is the event processing
and analytics layer which drives data
and provides transformation to the data
generated
it provides the ability to do event
processing the data is stored in the
database
the client layer is used to create a
web-based engine to interact with
external apis
this can be fed into the api management
systems this layer helps create a
dashboard and provides a view of
analytics and event processing
this layer helps communicate with
systems outside the network using
machine and machine communication
so we've seen the comprehensive iot
reference architecture with various
components rule engines interfaces and
security systems embedded
cross-functional architecture is
possible using device manager that
provides a single platform for remote
management the device manager
communicates with devices through set
protocols
device management uses device management
agents and is responsible for the remote
management of software
the identity layer has the capabilities
of cyber security including policy
control and oauth 2 token instruments
other capabilities include identity
services xacml pdp and directory of
users eg
ldap iot reference frameworks there are
a lot of frameworks for iot setup but
the most common is the iso
30141 and it provides commonly used
vocabulary reusable designs and best
practices for any developer to design an
application
it also has many secure application
standards that derive the maximum
benefit for the organization and reduce
the risks
iot standardization and design
considerations
there are a number of iot standards
and these are evolving over time some of
the key ones are m2m that is a machine
to machine service layer that can be
embedded in hardware and software to
connect devices
contiki which is an open source
operating system for low cost low power
iot microcontrollers
light os
a unix-like operating system for
wireless sensor networks
random phase multiple access
this is a proprietary standard for
connecting iot objects the last one is
sig fox a proprietary low power low
throughput technology for iot and m2m
communications
iot
interoperability challenges
iot maturity comes with several
challenges specifically pertaining to
interoperability and interfacing the
reasons are coexistence of multifarious
systems
devices sensors equipment etc that
interchange location time dependent
information in varied data formats
languages data models constructs data
quality and complex interrelationships
multivision
system designed by manufacturers over
time for varied application domains
making formulation of global agreements
and commonly accepted specifications
very difficult
new things that get introduced and that
support a new unanticipated structures
and protocols existence of low power
devices which need to exchange data over
lossy networks and may have minimal
likelihood or accessibility for a power
recharge in months or years
iot design considerations when you
choose an iot solution you need to
consider several factors
like its wireless capability
functionality interoperability secure
storage
immediate boot capacity device
categorization bandwidth cryptographic
control and power management the design
considerations should be a mix of the
estimated average of all these
components and index to balance the user
requirements you also need to set up a
dispute resolution mechanism in case of
failure in the long run
iot device architecture network and
cloud there are four stages of
integrating the different iot processes
stage 1 network things wireless sensors
and actuators
stage 2 sensor data aggregation systems
and analog to digital data conversion
stage 3 the appearance of edge i.t
systems
stage four analysis management and
storage of data as these stages are
evolving the devices the network and the
cloud application must be leveled
equally in ecosystem for better
stability and security the iot
architecture is a combination of things
devices platform and sensors with data
stage 1 of an iot architecture consists
of networked things typically wireless
sensors and actuators stage 2 has
internet gateways and data acquisition
systems that includes sensor data
aggregation systems and analog to
digital conversion in stage 3 edge it
systems perform pre-processing of the
data before it moves to the data center
or cloud finally in stage 4
data center and cloud is where the data
is analyzed managed and stored on
traditional backend data center systems
fundamentally we need to have a
functional scalable available and
maintainable architecture if these are
not supported then architecture is not
useful now let's look at the three
architecture areas of iot one the client
side iot device layer two operators on
the server side iot gateway layer
and three a pathway for connecting
clients and operators iot platform layer
these three layers interface with each
other on a data synchronization front
and pathway to generate more data from
various applications the feasibility of
the layers depends on their application
let's now differentiate between
centralized and decentralized iot
architectures the centralized
architecture is a hub and is managed
from one point whereas the decentralized
one is based on the use case
they do not help in industrial iot
solution the centralized architecture is
associated with cloud architectures in
which a central hub provides a series of
back-end services to smart devices in
decentralized architecture there are
many scenarios that require autonomous
communication between smart devices and
an iot topology without the need of
essential hub the centralized systems
help in event processing and whereas
decentralized systems operate more of
peer-to-peer messaging the decentralized
auditing is one of the essential
features that decentralized architecture
use case i have smart farming
use case smart farming iot design this
use case addresses the design
formalities using iot iot design is an
essential part of the navigational
ecosystem smart farming requires precise
architecture and components that help
bring benefits to the farmers the
various factors that determine the iot
design are data cost efficiency and
product quality the efficiency and
durability of the ecosystem help the
farmers plan their harvest and sow based
on the climatic conditions using the
sensors and geospatial location data so
be precise any farmer needs to
understand the fundamental design that
can help run the ecosystem smart farming
is useful as it helps the farmer to
predict conditions and sow crops with
less cost and utilize automation
capabilities to have such systems you
need to purchase the right hardware
which can monitor the accuracy of data
and quality of the sensor once you have
these systems you can benefit more from
farming there are four things you need
to integrate for smart farming first is
a data engine smart farming should have
a robust data processing engine that can
act as the brain and handle data
processing storage and lead to efficient
output
the second is hardware you need to
ensure that the hardware is durable and
easy to maintain hardware or self-fixing
algorithms is even better
the third aspect is mobile access this
is possible using a smartphone along
with offline or online mobile
applications
to enable all three processes you need
cloud infrastructure with the edge layer
this iot system can enable smart farming
for any crops in any geographical
location let us look at another use case
on using sim cards to monitor sugar
level in a diabetic patient diabetes
management is a recurring concept where
the patient has to check the blood sugar
at regular intervals in the traditional
way he has to go to the physician lab or
he has to have his home blood glucose
monitoring system iot can help create a
system with the blood glucose data will
be transmitted remotely via smartphone
and a sim embedded in it
identifying the necessary and right
hardware is one of the crucial steps of
creating such a system you need to
choose the sensors for your device or
create a custom one which fits the
glucometer this can be a sim card the
next step is to ensure that the quality
of your sensors is good and has seamless
integration with the system finally make
sure that the data monitoring happens in
real time with high accuracy now when
the hardware landscape of this ecosystem
is ready you need to set the software
then first it is crucial that you have
software with software pair algorithm
for service management to enable this
process you need cloud infrastructure
with edge and finally a smartphone to
work with the devices and sensors
key takeaways now that you have
completed this lesson you should be able
to explain iot reference architectures
and frameworks describe the iot interop
ability and its design considerations
and finally
discuss industry-aligned use cases
here's a list of iot projects for 2020.
first up is smart mirror smart mirrors
are a very cool iot application
these mirrors can be used to display
temperature news weather calendar clock
and complements on the screen apart from
these smart mirrors can be used to click
the perfect selfies with a built-in
camera it can also be installed with
speakers to play some music and they
also provide on-demand workout sessions
with world-class trainers
the mirror can be used to browse the
internet make phone calls and even be
connected with other devices for
collaboration
next up is smart money transfer we're
heading towards complete digitization
transactions are made possible on your
cell phone with apps like apple pay
google pay and paypal
but imagine if you could walk to a store
and pay with a wrist watch wouldn't that
be cool the purpose of the smart wallet
is to provide an easy and reliable
platform for money transactions it is
compact variable and rechargeable for
safety purposes the user authenticity is
validated the smart money transfer
technology can reduce the burden of
mobile money transfer when you're on the
go you could easily step into a store
purchase the goods and pay hassle free
after every successful transaction the
balance is updated immediately to avoid
any uncertainty next up is iot based
smart arm
now this project includes the creation
of a robotic arm which can pick and
place things from one place to another
to control this action the robotic arm
can be moved using specific commands
some advanced arms allow the user to
change the end effect of the arm to
perform various different actions it can
be used to make art print 3d images and
build production lines
it can also be used to perform your
day-to-day chores at number four we have
smart irrigation
now with changing climate and recurrent
water crisis
farmers suffer a great deal with growing
crops smart irrigation puts an end to
this ordeal
this system comes with the moisture
sensor that checks the soil for its
water content when the soil moisture
drops below a certain value the system
triggers the water supply at number five
we have smart door now as the name
suggests this project aims at creating
smart doors that control the entry and
exit of humans these doors open and
close automatically when you pass by
the door can also be controlled remotely
you could unlock the door for a friend
by tapping an icon on your smartphone
once they exit you're immediately
notified the owner can also choose who
has the access to the door at number 6
we have air monitoring system now air
monitoring has become crucial for the
environment and what better way to do it
than incorporating iot the iot system
uses air sensors to sense the presence
of harmful gases or compounds in the air
the data collected can be used by the
local authorities to make a detailed
analysis
necessary actions can also be taken to
ensure that the air quality levels don't
reach an extreme low especially in areas
with hospitals and schools
moving on to number seven we have smart
alarm clock now there are many
variations of a smart alarm clock but
the alarm we are talking about is a self
setting alarm the smart alarm clock uses
your google calendar to check your
appointments to set the alarm it can
also procure data from gps about your
eta to a particular place and consider
the weather to automatically adjust your
wake time
all of this is just making life more
easier moving on at number eight we have
iot based weather reporting system
now the system deals with monitoring
weather and climate changes like
humidity temperature moisture wind speed
uv radiation light intensity and even
carbon monoxide levels in the air using
multiple sensors now these installed
sensors send data to the web page that
is plotted as graphical statistics
the project even consists of an
application that sends notifications as
an effective alert to warn people about
sudden and drastic weather changes
so when you're heading out the app could
easily tell you what the weather will be
like and suggest carrying an umbrella or
perhaps a sunblock
at number 9 we have smart wheelchair
there are over 132 million wheelchair
users across the globe
smart wheelchairs is an excellent
innovation typically it comes with
built-in sensors on the seats that
collect data every second
the data provides insight into the
seating behavior of the patient and the
energy required to maintain the posture
other variations of smart wheelchairs
could include fall detection these
features allow people to monitor the
patient from a remote location
and finally at number 10 we have smart
street light system
this iot based street light monitoring
system not only monitors but also
ensures low power consumption and
detects faulty lights
the street lights have external sensing
that automatically turns on at the
desired intensity based on the lighting
needed
control of light intensity is based on
the movement of people or vehicles
in case of an emergency the lights
increase the brightness to maximum
intensity thereby ensuring safety
when deployed as a part of a smart city
the users can be informed about any
outages
they can also register a complaint for
immediate service
and so with that we come to the end of
this session i hope you have a good
understanding of iot now thank you so
