hi I'm Casey feastler I am an associate
professor of information science at
University of Colorado Boulder and a lot
of the research that I do is around
technology ethics and especially
research ethics
I am part of a big project on Research
ethics for pervasive data in
computational research and that's a lot
of what I'm talking about today how do
we think about research ethics for
computational social science especially
when we are collecting data that is
publicly available like from social
media
I'm Casey and uh my training is actually
in human-centered Computing and law I'm
going to talk very sparingly about law
because as I will say at some point uh
law and ethics are not the same thing
and we are fortunate when they overlap
[Music]
um
so
I think it's a really great thing that
we're starting off uh with the topic of
Ethics because what you really hate is
to get it at the very end now you've
been learning how to do this for a
couple of weeks and here's the stuff you
should have been thinking about all
along
sometimes I joke that being someone who
studies technology ethics means that I
just make slides that look like this
over and over until I retire
um and you will see some of these come
up again at various points
we might start off with is what is
ethics anyway in this context I am not
going to try to answer this question for
you at all in fact during the course of
all of this
I'm not really here to give you answers
I'm here to give you questions
so sometimes people will ask me Casey so
you've you've finished teaching ethics
to the computer science students when
you're done with that are they more
ethical
which is a very hard question to answer
but I also tend to think of instruction
around things like ethics
as not being about creating a more
ethical person but in assuming that you
all want to do the right thing everyone
in this room everyone wants to do the
ethical thing right it's that we often
don't know how to spot the problems or
the issues and sometimes what we should
actually do about it is a bit elusive
but what I'm hoping is that through the
course of this I can give you a lot of
things that you should be thinking about
as you go about your work
I'm also going to give you a wrong
answer to this question though which is
that ethics for researchers with the IRB
tells you you can do
when I say IRB here I mean this is a bit
of shorthand because I happen to be
standing at a university in the United
States so an Institutional review board
is what academic institutions in the
United States use to do ethics review
you might see similar things in other
countries sometimes they're called
ethics review boards or ethics
committees and in some places there
isn't this kind of review at all
but in the United States specifically
the purview of an IRB is very narrow
right so ethics review at U.S
institutions is about human subjects
research
and this is defined in federal law
and human subjects research
means either
directly interacting with a person a
human
or collecting identifiable private
information
um and or
um a lot of what you'll be talking about
here most of the research that you just
heard about in that introduction would
not fall under this definition right
um
I do a lot of actual human subjects
research interviewing people surveys
this sort of thing but I also do uh what
one might consider computational social
science or even qualitative
work on Trace data I'm going to talk to
you actually about some work that I did
at some point that was analyzing
comments on news articles as a data
source
I did not get IRB approval for this
project because it does not fall under
the the definition of human subjects
research but that doesn't mean that
there are no ethical issues with this
kind of research right so for example
all of these are are things that made
headlines
um we have uh data from dating sites
YouTube videos uh tweets more dating
sites uh facial recognition from images
found online so these are often the
kinds of data that you're talking about
and often we'll hear about research
sometimes even that Sparks controversy
and it might not even be immediately
obvious what the data source is like the
the famous gaydar
study out of out of Stanford where they
use off-the-shelf facial recognition to
show that they could with some accuracy
predict sexual orientation from a
photograph
okay
how did they do that where did the data
come from where do you get labeled data
with sexual orientation because they
didn't ask people right so that data
came from a dating site I don't think
that it was tender actually
but the point is there is a lot of data
like this that's just it's just there
right and you'll be thinking about a lot
of different sources of data
and we've seen this kind of research for
years now right and when I was finishing
up my PhD in 2014 2015 we were just
starting to think about this stuff like
I was in a lab
where we talked about research ethics a
lot and these conversations around like
oh well what about what about the ethics
of using tweets like we were just
starting to have these conversations
like less than than 10 years ago
frequently right and actually since then
since uh starting in 2015 I've been
running
workshops at a lot of different
conferences mostly in computer science
around research ethics especially
research ethics that falls through these
cracks of human subjects research so
especially like research ethics for
using public data
and we just talk about the same
questions over and over again and having
and and having conversations about
research ethics especially for public
data
what is public anyway
um when is or is ever consent
appropriate what about violations of
terms of service
how do we account for the fact that even
if we might think this is unreasonable
most people don't think that researchers
are using or using their data what about
things like stolen or leaked or deleted
data anonymization practices how do we
even create shared expectations in a
single discipline or 150 disciplines
what kinds of precautions should we be
taking for vulnerable populations in
particular
and what are our obligations to those
communities and these are just again
questions that I hear over and over and
I'll address some of these but I don't
necessarily have answers
uh to any of these again but things to
think about but one of the big questions
that we often start talking about when
having this conversation is okay so I
want to do a research project using
Trace data
how do you decide whether it's okay
for your definition of okay
to collect data I hear two answers most
commonly when you ask someone this
question the first one
is well what are the terms of service
say
I'm guessing that some of you might have
read terms of service at some point
perhaps even for this exact for this
exact reason
I'm going to be talking a little bit
about some work now that I did with
Brian Keegan at my University and Nathan
beard who's a PhD student at University
of Maryland now I want to point out
something real quick before I continue
this conversation about terms of service
which is
legal and ethical or not the same thing
I'm actually not going to be talking
much about the legal issues here
um in part because they tend to be less
interesting to me and and mostly less
important
to me
um
but for what it's worth
recent court cases suggests that it's
probably not a Computer Fraud and Abuse
Act violation to scrape against terms of
service I also
um
perhaps not my not the area of expertise
that I am known for now but my
dissertation was all about copyright law
I also think that copyright law is not
the interesting part of what's Happening
Here but I'm happy that to talk about uh
to talk to you guys about fair use in
copyright law and that sort of thing
during the breaks if if you want to
um but what I want to think about here
is
ethical issues in violating terms of
service so
for example if a website says
do not do academic research here
and FetLife which is a social network
for Kink and fetishes is the only
website I've ever seen that has this
explicit prohibition and you can imagine
why that might be
right
so if we want to talk about the legality
of violating terms of service this is
basically the same as as any other
website when that might have a
Prohibition on
unscraping or research
but you might think that the ethical
issues are a little bit different here
because of the very specific prohibition
for you as academic researchers
and you might have seen many Provisions
that look just like this right or
variations thereon and so as part of a
research project a few years ago we
analyzed the data scraping Provisions
for over a hundred different social
media and social networking websites
I use Yik Yak as an example here
actually because this is a website that
started my interest in this topic
because when I was a PhD student at
Georgia Tech Yik Yak was actually based
in Atlanta we were one of the first
universities to have it
and we were talking about
how interesting it would be to get data
from Yik Yak in my research lab and me
being the buzz kill lawyer I went and
read the terms of service and I said hey
you know technically we're not allowed
to do this
and my advisor said well we know them
we'll just ask them and they said no
and then guess who didn't study
and meanwhile other researchers are
publishing Yik Yak papers and we're just
but I wouldn't use this as an example
real quick actually because I think this
is an interesting one because
uh if you're not familiar with Yik Yak
it is a location-based
um ephemeral social networking site it
went away for a while and then it came
back last year uh but it's very very
popular on college campus and around
2015.
Anonymous location-based ephemeral the
data goes away
so you can imagine
why yukak might not want people to be
creating Archives of data from a website
where the expectation of the users is
that it's going away
right and this is not the only site
that's like that but do they say that
here do they say this is why no they
don't and they almost never do
um I don't expect you to take any
meaning from from this table
um this is a way that we coded all of
these different data scraping Provisions
for things like whether they prohibited
uh only automated scraping or manual
scraping as well or anything and whether
they had any kind of like special
Provisions whether it was just for
personal anyway the point of this is
super inconsistent
if you read the terms of service for
Instagram that tells you nothing about
the terms of service for Yik Yak right
when it comes to data scraping but
they're also super vague like
don't scrape
things that don't matter include
what kind of data for the most part what
you're going to do with it who you are
what the expectations of the nor and the
Norms of the users are are basically all
of the kinds of things that you think
might matter for an ethical decision
like what I just mentioned with respect
to Yik Yak
um
so that answer to Is it okay for me to
collect data here
if you are making a decision solely
based on terms of service
so if the terms of service prohibit it I
cannot collect data if the terms of
service say nothing about it I can
collect data
that strategy has two major problems
one is that it assumes that violating
terms of services inherently unethical
I would argue that that is not true
and one of the reasons I say that that I
don't think that's true is in part
because
you can put whatever you want in a terms
of service you might in fact put in a
terms of service anyone can scrape data
here
unless you're an academic researcher and
you're going to say bad things about our
platform
um
there's actually a provision that is
like getting very close to saying that
in parlors in terms of service
um
and the other thing is that
there are some reasons for perhaps the
good of society where we might want to
make sure that not only
people who have
the access that data are the only ones
who can study it right this conversation
has come up a lot with respect to
Facebook in particular
um
Facebook is not the only platform for
which this is relevant but we've just
had a whole lot of conversations about
them in particular
and there are a lot of amazing
researchers at Facebook
a lot of amazing researchers and our
community who are doing really cool work
and they're publishing papers
lots of them and the data that they have
access to is amazing
but
they're still
a company with corporate interests
and this is true
for any platform
honestly this is true for if you build a
new platform
what's your incentive
to want to know how that platform harms
society and then tell everyone about it
I will give some sort of rare kudos to
uh Twitter
Twitter did an audit on one of their
algorithms a couple of years ago and
published a scientific paper about how
it was biased
you don't see that very much right so
the argument is that
we might want external researchers
to be able to study
the data that comes from platforms to be
able to look at their impact on society
Etc and a lot of and and a lot of
platforms including Facebook are trying
to find ways to open up access to data
in part for that for that reason
Facebook has run into some problems with
this
more movement even recently in trying to
make this happen and in fact right now
in the EU there's a proposed law the
Digital Services act that if passed
might require platforms to open up data
to researchers more
of course this becomes complicated when
you consider that also Facebook in
particular has gotten into some hot
water when it comes to research
happening on their platform and so
there's actually a really fine line uh
to walk here and a lot of the different
things that I'm going to talk about
today have these tensions the tension
for example between protecting people's
privacy and open science would be a
great example
but also
we don't want to think that violating
terms of service is the only thing that
could make data collection unethical and
so actually now let's put aside in terms
of service for the rest of this and and
think about these other kinds of things
so
the answer that I actually hear a lot
more than talking about terms of service
as well is the data public
right these These are the magic words
when it comes to trace data is it public
so for example
um OkCupid the dating site technically
public right
um and in 2016 there was
a big controversy because a researcher
scraped all of OkCupid and put the data
set online
without any anonymization
um I don't know if any of you use
OkCupid or have in the past but the way
that the matching algorithm on that site
works is that you answer many many many
many many questions about yourself
and from uh what's bigger the Sun or the
Earth
kind of question to like extremely
detailed question about people's sexual
preferences
um and at the time people were pointing
out you know
you've got people's usernames here
you've got their locations it would not
be hard to identify a lot of people in
this data set and when called out about
this on Twitter the researchers said uh
but the data's already public
and this is such a common response that
this was the title of my collaborator
Michael Zimmer's paper in 2010
and he has a Google a Google alert set
for this phrase
the data is already public
and publicness of data is one of those
like get out of IRB free cards right
and so this is often the sole ethical
heuristic
for using Trace data so now I'm going to
spend like an hour and a half telling
you why that should not be the case
um so
again this this paper was written in
2010 uh you know in early paper about
this kind of thing and it was with
respect to Facebook uh
even at that time Facebook data was
pretty hard to get
but we started getting data it was much
easier to get
um
in 2014 zainab tufeki wrote a paper
about social media big data and made a
point that I think is very important
which is why do we use Twitter data so
much
is Twitter so great like is Twitter what
most people are using is Twitter the
representation no
we use Twitter data because it's easy to
get
um and in this paper she talks about
Twitter as essentially the fruit fly
of academic research
that Twitter has the model organism
problem we know people don't study the
fruit fly because the fruit fly is like
the organism that's most like every no
it like has a really short lifespan so
it's really easy to study
same thing right you know if we were
going to study social media data based
on uh like Global representation we
would have thousands and thousands and
thousands of papers each year using
Facebook data not Twitter data right but
Twitter is one of the big ones
regardless of the reason
um and the point made earlier about how
this has some representation issues uh
is important as well the exclusions of
Big Data
but this is the state of the world I'm
also going to talk about Reddit later
but in
uh 2017 when I started doing research in
this area Twitter was definitely the big
one and myself and my collaborator Nick
perferas who's at Arizona State
University now wanted to answer a pretty
simple question which was how do Twitter
users feel about this
because we weren't talking about this a
lot at the time because it wasn't people
it was just data like a data set of 10
million tweets
that's not people it's it's data it's
public right so we conducted a survey of
Twitter users about how they feel about
the use of their tweets and research and
in particular the contextual factors
that might influence that now you might
be thinking about the totally obvious
selection bias in this study right
we surveyed people about how they feel
about research so people had to opt in
to take a survey we cannot survey people
without their consent
and when we did the study we're like
there is a very good chance that we get
the survey results back and everyone's
like yeah research is great
um because why would people who hate
research participate in our research
study about how they feel about research
um
that wasn't her finding but I bring this
up because a I want you to realize that
I recognized the selection bias but B I
actually think that
the attitudes that you're gonna see here
are better than if we were able to get a
to get a sample without that kind of
selection bio so first of all
61 of the people we surveyed had
absolutely no idea this was a thing
um
and and anecdotally I hear this a lot
right I talk to people about my research
they like I'm like yeah you know I study
like research topics of scientists using
tweets or YouTube videos or Reddit posts
or whatever and they're like wait what
why would scientists read my tweets
um this might seem obvious to you but
like this is a data source but to the
average person
no
um
we also asked people well
do you think that's allowed
like our researchers permitted to use
tweets without permission and almost
half were like no definitely not they
must be breaking some kind of rules here
and of those people who thought that
this has to be against the rules uh 61
thought thought well they're clearly
like breaking some kind of ethical rule
for researchers
um it also 23 were like yeah this is
also definitely a violation of Twitter's
terms of service
um and that one's interesting because
Twitter's uh actually not their terms of
service their privacy policy is like hey
just so you know University researchers
might be using your tweets of course
people don't read terms of service right
which is another reason why if we're
thinking about the ethical issues with
like following terms of service
you can't assume that well their terms
of service doesn't prohibit research so
therefore people must know there's going
to be research there
um terms of service are not a
particularly good proxy for knowledge of
anything
because people don't read them
we also asked people
well regardless of
you know whether you think it's allowed
and actually regardless of how you feel
about your tweets specifically
should researchers be able to do this
um and Moe said no
actually but more interestingly
we asked people to explain
why they felt this way and this is where
the contextual factors started to come
up
well does the research serve a greater
purpose
was I told about it
is it a large-scale study or is it my
individual tweet being picked out of
this
right we went into this study not like
our our question wasn't
should researchers use tweet I am not
going to do a study where I tell
researchers they can't use tweets like
if I thought there was any chance that
was going to be the answer like I was a
second year Professor I was not going to
go that there right
and actually throughout the course of
all of this I'm not I'm never suggesting
that we should not be doing this kind of
work the important thing is how do we do
it so this is where contextual factors
become really important and I don't
expect you to take meaning quickly out
of this chart but we asked people about
all these different things like were you
informed was it analyzed along with
millions of tweets was it a protected
account was it deleted was it analyzed
by a computer program or a person
these kinds of things
and the point of this is that these
kinds of things matter
and so let me give you a few examples
so the purpose of the study is one thing
that matters on someone on the previous
slide said does it serve a greater
purpose we also saw a number of people
who
were unhappy that like this this work
was probably being done by like evil
liberal academics
um which I which is a point that I'll
come back to later as well so but to
these people it mattered who they were
who's doing the research
also the content of the tweet and this
seems really obvious
right
um well is it personal is it
embarrassing is it identifying what's
the tweet
people thought about anonymity is it
tied to their name
and also issues with
dissemination
well do I get to read the findings of
the paper
was I
credited with my handle in there people
feel differently about that as well
um but I think the big Point here
and this looks similar to a slide that I
have a moment ago is that data
collection decisions should not be
context agnostic like these things
matter what's the data what are you
going to do with it who are you what are
the Norms of the users and the big Point
here is that all of these things are not
just publicness
publicness is a a floor not a ceiling
when it comes to like
no we do not want to be studying not
public data right so an example of this
would be like a private health related
Forum where you have to have a login to
read it uh you're not
I hopefully think that most people would
not think it was okay to just use that
kind of data without consent like not in
public data or like the slack Channel
for this institute like just taking the
data from that without people's
permission
but if we consider publicness
as a floor as a bare minimum there are a
lot of other things we should be
thinking about as well
um and I'm going to go through a few of
these this is not a comprehensive list
of all of the types of things that you
might want to be thinking about but I'm
going to go through a number of things
that have come up specifically in my
research and specific cases that I that
I've heard about so I'm going to go
through a couple of these before before
we take a break
so first of all
it's important to not think of data as
just data
if that data comes from people so I'm
mostly thinking about social media data
and the kinds of stuff that I'm talking
about here because that's such a common
piece of Trace data for human behavior
you could imagine some other categories
of data but the important thing here is
that it's not all the same
so here's a tweet
a tweet that I got when searching for
breakfast
and Twitter in 2018 when I first gave a
talk like this
um so here's someone tweeting about what
they had for breakfast at the time I
also looked for some tweets on some
other topics and another tweet that I
found had someone talking about being
HIV positive
and I was able to find this by doing a
search for HIV positive in Twitter
this is actually an obfuscated tweet
it's paraphrased I don't even remember
what the original tweet was at this
point but why would I even need to use
that tweet on a slide
um let alone
published in an academic paper where
someone could search for it and find
that person again pretty easily
the idea that these two tweets are
equivalent and should be treated exactly
the same as absurd
right these are not the same
there are some types of data that
requires more care the same would be
true if you were doing human subjects
research right so like I've done many
many many many
protocols for the IRB from the ethics
review board at my University and
sometimes I do projects where I'm asking
computer science students hey what did
you think about this assignment in this
class
uh very recently I've started doing a
project about uh type 1 diabetes talking
to people about very personal Health
Data the Hoops that I have to jump
through for the IRB are different which
is completely appropriate because some
kinds of content is more sensitive than
others
so there was a study conducted that was
published in 2018 where they looked for
tweets in PubMed articles so PubMed is
all medical health published papers
lots of public health research uses
tweets
so 72 percent of the articles that use
Twitter data quoted tweets directly and
they could lead back to the Twitter user
84 of the time
and these are tweets about medical stuff
right these are not what did you have
for breakfast
tweets
um so again these these things are
different this reminder that data does
come from people and here's people
talking about their health conditions
let me give you another data as people
example
um
this is from a published paper
that is matching these photographs to
BMI body mass index so there's a data
set that that was based on helping
AI to be able to determine BMI from a
photograph of just your face
so in order to do that
what do you need you need photographs of
faces
and you need BMI so there are a couple
of different ways you could do this one
you bring in a bunch of people you ask
them their height and weight and you
take a photograph of their face and you
create a data set which would be a lot
of work or you can go to the subreddit
where people are sharing their weight
loss Journeys and they're saying here's
my height and weight and here's my
photograph
right
so
I have no idea if the people in the
subreddit ever found out about the study
or have any idea uh that it happened
even the people who were shown in a
paper with the bar over their eyes but I
want you to think for a minute about the
people in this data
why do you share a photograph of
yourself with your height height and
weight this is a very vulnerable thing
to decide to show this to a bunch of
strangers on the internet
and these are often folks who and we
know this based on the stories that
they're sharing here as well
don't even want to talk to their doctors
about this people often lie about their
weight to their doctors
um or you know don't want to be weighed
or or whatever it's a very vulnerable
thing to show weight loss photos to
strangers on the internet and probably
weren't expecting
that to be used in any other way right
um my understanding is actually that
this data set has been removed in part
because of these kinds of
ethical concerns
um
but let me give you another example of
this kind of thing
there were researchers who were
using YouTube videos of people sharing
gender transition stories to train
facial recognition
to be able to
still be able to do facial recognition
for for gender
um depending on where some where someone
was in a gender transition
um and
this was a story in Verge about this at
the time and this part here particularly
struck me so there was someone who's
transition picture was in a scientific
paper just like the example that I just
showed you
um and she didn't know about this until
it came to her attention much later and
talked about how it felt like a
violation of privacy
um so there was no consent
uh here but also this is another example
of
why would someone share this on YouTube
right
very vulnerable you're doing this to
help your community if you're make
putting up a YouTube video about your
gender transition you are not doing that
for science right
um
I do think that Norms around these
things are changing this is another data
set that is gone
um this data set was retracted
again because in part because of of
ethical concerns and I think these are
things that are changing but these are
really important examples of remembering
the humans in the data
so I want to talk now a bit about
informed consent or rather not informed
consent but informing and consenting
um so I'm gonna talk now a little bit
about
a particular research ethics controversy
that you might have heard about the
Facebook emotional contagion study
so this happened in 2014 actually as I
was finishing up my PhD and I mentioned
that people were starting to talk more
about these kinds of things and this was
one of the flash points in the social
Computing research community that kicked
off conversations about research ethics
that we were not having before
the short version of this is that some
academic researchers worked with
researchers at Facebook and they wanted
to test the psychological phenomenon of
emotional contagion which is basically
if you're around people who are happy
you're happier if you're on people who
are sad you're sadder so the question
was does this happen on social media and
so
as you all I'm sure know Facebook has an
algorithm that is constantly tweaking
the kinds of stuff that you see on your
news feed so it's just a matter of
putting people into experimental
conditions where their news feed was
tweaked based on sentiment analysis to
show uh more positive or less positive
content and then doing that same kind of
analysis on what that person posted
afterwards
and
the initial press release and the first
couple of news stories about this was
researchers show that emotional
contagion happens on social media I mean
it was a very small effect but it was
significant
and then
the headlines after that were
Facebook researchers are manipulating
you to make you sad
um
and exercise that you might find useful
and we'll talk a little bit more about
this kind of speculation as I go on in
this talk
um
it was a good idea to imagine
the worst possible headline someone
could write about your research
I sometimes have my students do this
um
now whether these sort of outcry about
this was appropriate or not
it was an interesting way to look at how
people reacting to research so I talked
about the selection bias in my study
earlier how do you find out how people
feel about research they don't want to
participate in your research study about
how much they hate reading yeah
um so I did my own study of Trace data
we wanted to find out what people were
upset about when it came to this
particular study and so we analyzed
comments on news articles
about it
um and there were a lot of interesting
findings here a lot of which aren't
particularly relevant to issues of Trace
data which is what I'm mostly talking
about here but I wanted to bring up one
thing that came up in our findings that
I think is relevant generally
which was this idea of
I didn't come here to be your science
experiment
I'm not on Facebook to jump in a petri
dish
I'm not a lab rat
um
the findings that we got here and a
little bit out of that survey like I
gave you the example of like the person
who said they didn't want liberal
academics studying them
um there are some people who
fundamentally
do not want to be part of your science
experiment
they do not want their Trace data in
your study
now I'm not saying this as a way to
suggest that this means no more
computational social science using Trace
data ever but this is an important thing
for you to know
because there are then certain types of
content that you might want to treat
differently or certain ways that you
might want to be careful
to assuage potential
concerns that people might have like
this
um and in this case
we actually saw also a lot of
disagreement about how people felt in
this case and it was in part because
they had different ideas of like what
Facebook is for and what their
relationship is to it
and also
to be frank there are just a lot of
people who think that Facebook is evil
and will absolutely ascribe worst
possible intentions to anything ever
um and again in the survey that we did
about Twitter there was a someone who
said like well is this for the greater
good right I feel differently if this is
for science versus if this is for like
uh market research or something like
that so these kinds of things matter
as well
and then of course we have the examples
of like data where
someone explicitly will not give you
their consent or in this case and this
is the FetLife data scraping provision
Provisions again
they said you can get consent from the
platform
so I am not going to suggest that anyone
should try to get individual consent
from a million people on Twitter
like you're going to do public health
research about covet or whatever I'm not
I am not suggesting that you need to be
tweeting out a consent form
to every person in your data set
um but there are some things that you
might consider
um if any of you have ever used Reddit
data
a thing that you might do is get consent
from the subreddit for example
um this is a message that was posted to
our drugs
um which was
uh well actually here they they the
moderators on our drugs knew that
research was happening based on their
subreddit
and they basically said we know that
because of reddit's terms of service and
the fact that they have an API and all
that we can't stop you
from scraping data
but we would really ask that you
announced yourself
to the moderators
because it's the right thing to do
ethically now
this is something that someone could do
anywhere
there there are some subreddits also
that just say don't research us
and you might be thinking also but what
if I ask the moderators and they say no
and the question you might ask yourself
is why do they say no
right so this goes back to the sort of
like legal versus ethical thing
um and then you might ask yourself well
but what if I want to do it anyway
and then the question I would ask you is
why
so something that I want you to be
thinking about sort of throughout all of
this
and in some ways this is a simplistic
way of thinking about research ethics
but it's appropriate
um
harm versus benefit
there's a lot of research
that people do
because it's never been done before
have any of you ever
reviewed a paper where that's literally
the only justification
for the project at all like there's
absolutely nothing about why this should
be done except we are the first to do X
there are a lot of things that haven't
been done because they're not worth
doing
um and there is research that absolutely
might have benefit that might outweigh
something
um like the comfort of the people who
are being studied
an example I might give actually is
looking at arguably like toxic
communities
so there are a lot of people who do
research on say
explicitly racist online communities
Community there used to be I mean I
think they're mostly gone now
go Reddit but like there were subreddits
that were explicitly devoted
to racism and misogyny and fat shaming
and these sorts of things
there might legitimately be really
important things that we need to learn
about these kinds of interactions and if
they are happening publicly
I think that you can make
um a benefit versus harm analysis in
part because
if this were not our drugs if this were
one of those communities
a researcher
might be actively putting themselves in
danger
by telling the community right but in
these cases you need to be thinking
about the benefits and you need to be
thinking about the way that you're doing
the research and we'll talk about some
of those things as well I think we have
all right I have one more Point
um on this topic and then we're going to
take a break before I go into some more
things
this was another Finding from the
Twitter study
we asked people what would you want to
know if your Tweet was in a research
study and the answer is yes most people
want to know and 83 percent of people
said they'd want to read the paper now
is this actually true would they really
want to read the paper Maybe
um
but this is an interesting point
inform and consent are not the same
thing
you can potentially inform people
without consenting them
and again I don't necessarily mean
you know contacting sending an email to
everyone who's in your data set of a
million tweets
but let's say for example you study a
subreddit
you could post the paper in that
subreddit when you're done with it again
if it's not going to be something that's
going to put you in in danger or or
something like that
or you might
tweet to a hashtag
one of my PhD students did a study at
black Twitter recently
tweeted about it to the black Twitter
hashtag I write I have done a bunch of
studies of fandom I write Tumblr posts
about them I've made tick talks about
research
we very often study communities without
giving anything back to them at all not
even the knowledge that we gained from
that community
um
and I will talk more about that a bit
again later
from
one of the most important things is to
be thinking about it at all
sometimes this means
speculating about possible harms
thinking through the kinds of questions
that I just took you all through
and also writing about your ethical
considerations when for example you
publish a paper this is also how we
learn from each other if you want to
learn more about my work and the work
for my collaborators you can find out
more about the pervade pervasive ethics
for computational research project and
also I am of course all over social
media so that everyone can study my
tweets you can find me on Twitter at
cfisler and on Tick Tock at Professor
