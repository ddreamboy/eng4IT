openai just released a new text generating 
program called gpt3 the previous version gpt2  
made some noise and was recently used on images it 
uses the same principles as a text generating task  
in order to complete an image it is really 
cool and different than your typical papers  
this newer version of the gpt program is 
shockingly good and has taken twitter by storm  
it alone shows how far the field has come 
someone even made a website to create all  
the impressive gpt3 applications in one place you 
should definitely look it up the link is in the  
description box below let's quickly look at how it 
works and then show more impressive examples of it  
the current state-of-the-art nlp systems struggle 
to generalize to work on different tasks they need  
to be fine-tuned on data sets of thousands of 
examples while humans only need to see a few  
examples to perform a new language task this was 
the goal behind gpt3 to improve the task agnostic  
characteristic of language models of course this 
model is pre-trained but it is never touched again  
specifically they train gpt-3 on a data set of 
half a trillion words for 175 billion parameters  
which is 10 times more than any previous 
non-sparse language model then there is no  
more fine-tuning to do with this model only few 
shot demonstrations specified purely via text  
interaction with the modal for example an english 
sentence and the french translation the few shot  
works by giving k examples of context and 
completion and then one final example of  
context with the model expected to provide the 
completion without changing the model's parameters  
the model even sometimes reach competitiveness 
with prior state-of-the-art approaches  
that are directly fine-tuned on the specific task 
in short it works great because its memory pretty  
much contains all text ever published by humans 
on the internet i will stop my review of the paper  
at this point but you should definitely give a 
look at their paper for a better understanding  
of this new gpd3 model i linked it in the 
description below let's look at more awesome  
examples using this new gpt model another app 
made by sharif is a sentence describing what  
google's home page should look and here's gp3 
generating the code for it nearly perfectly  
i invite you to pause the video whenever 
you need more time to see the examples
harland duman had gpt3 write some css for 
him without even giving it examples first
paras chopra made a fully functioning search 
engine on top of gpt3 for any arbitrary query  
it returns the exact answer and the 
corresponding url it's mind blowingly good
faraz got gpg3 to start 
writing sql queries for him
matt schumer has built an ai inception he used 
gpd3 to generate code for machine learning model  
just by describing the data set and required 
output this is the start of no code ai other  
side ai built a program that is going to change 
the way you work using gpt3 it automatically  
write emails in your personal style by simply 
writing the key points you want to get across
if you think the gpt demos 
with just text are impressive  
check this out ben lindsay built a 
model that generates music videos  
based on input text by replacing the final 
layers of the gpt3 with a flowgan architecture
one last great example was made by tushar who 
has created rev theo using gpt3 he has tried  
to revise the way we have been using dictionaries 
for ages of course this was just a simple overview  
of this new paper i strongly recommend to 
read the paper linked in the description
