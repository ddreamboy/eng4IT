my name is bettina warburg i'm a
researcher of transformative
technologies and co-founder of animal
ventures today i've been challenged to
explain one concept at five levels of
increasing complexity
my topic is blockchain technology
blockchain is a new network and it's
going to help us decentralize trade
allowing us to do a lot of our
transactions much more peer-to-peer
directly and lower our use of
intermediaries like companies or banks
may be i think today everyone can leave
understanding something about blockchain
at some level
do you know what we're going to talk
about today
it's called blockchain what's blockchain
that's a really good question it's
actually a way that we can trade
do you know what trade is
it's like it's when you take turns every
time that's when you give a most of what
you want right when you give up most of
what you want well sometimes that
definitely happens for sure what if i
told you that there's a kind of
technology that i work on that means you
could trade with any kid all over the
world really yeah if i could trade with
any kid i would trade
well i would chase something i don't
like so much that's probably a good idea
maybe somebody else likes it more than
you do so normally when people trade
they have to go to the store or they
have to know the person so that they can
get what they asked for with blockchain
you can make that exact same trade but
you don't need the store and you don't
even necessarily need to know the other
person
really really
so ian do you know what blockchain is no
have you ever traded or sold anything
actually i'm selling my computer on ebay
right now that's amazing what made you
decide to trade on ebay um well i mean
i've heard of it and i trust it a lot
because there's they have like all their
guarantees so i i know that i'm gonna
get money and the person's gonna get
what they want so what if i told you
that blockchain technology is basically
a tool where you can do the exact same
thing but it goes to you and i directly
you wouldn't need an ebay or a brand in
between that's cool and there's a lot of
those kinds of middlemen
in our society today right we have a lot
of banks we have a lot of
companies that sort of
help us make sure that our trades happen
but if we could guarantee the same trade
using technology
as sort of like a technological trust
then we wouldn't really need all those
middlemen in between so how does it work
it's basically a network of computers
that all have the same history
of transactions and so instead of sort
of there being one company with one
database that holds all the information
the same sort of list
is held by all these different people
like you could have it on your computer
and then it gets validated by everyone
and basically that turns into the next
part of the list so it's sort of
constantly updating itself so like how
do you make sure that it's secure so it
uses cryptography and that helps it
basically encode all of the transactions
so you can't really see exactly what
happened but you know it happened
because it's like a marker so you could
kind of like i don't know say trade you
trade apples but you would just see like
random letters yeah for it so you
wouldn't be able to like track it i
guess exactly that's cool so it's kind
of this like really big ledger or
accounting system for all sorts of
things that get traded but instead of
being owned by one company
it's owned by everybody that's cool yeah
we're going to talk about blockchain
technology have you heard of blockchain
i've heard of the words blockchain but
i'm not sure i know what it is so when
we were much smaller societies you and i
could trade in our community pretty
easily but as the distance in our trade
grew we ended up inventing institutions
right if you use uber or you use
airbnb or you use amazon even these are
just digital marketplaces and platforms
that help us facilitate an exchange of
value
but today we actually have a technology
that allows us to trade one-to-one but
at scale and it's called blockchain
technology there is some kind of
interface for it you could have an app
or you could use your computer to do it
but instead of there being a company in
the middle or what's helping you make
that transaction is a bunch of software
code and so it's being run by all of
these different computers
that have like a node so they're all
running the same software and
guaranteeing your transactions
um as they happen i mean i would assume
this technology is taking away business
or activity from these middlemen in some
cases yeah it is and a lot of people in
the financial industry in particular are
looking at it from the banking side of
how do we use
this technology to trade things like
bitcoin or other tokens that um
are easier to use instead of today's
currency you know a lot of people think
about blockchain as bitcoin
because it's sort of in the news a lot
and it's this new cryptocurrency and
it's kind of exciting but we're actually
seeing a lot more use cases for
blockchain that aren't around the
currency side they're more around how do
you take any asset
and be able to trade that using the same
technology is there a mechanism for
verifying
that person a is a legitimate
seller or producer of the item
so today a lot of people are working on
how to create identity structures that
leverage blockchain and one of the tools
for doing that is being able to
cryptographically sign
for
a given attribute so your
government could sign that you have a
u.s passport or a university could sign
that you are a currently enrolled
student and you could then dole out that
information
and control it yourself and be able to
show people those certifications on an
as needed basis
so today we're going to talk about
blockchain technology okay have you ever
heard of blockchain i have whenever we
have a transaction and let's say i buy
something from you this information gets
logged and it gets verified by a third
person or third party and then
if like all this information verified
and it all matches right the transaction
goes through without any intermediary
basically right and it gets stored
and when we make further transactions
this information is already embedded
it's in the in the ledger yeah that's
exactly right and you can append it you
can sort of add new information that's
more current but you can't actually go
erase anything absolutely right the way
the technology is changing nothing's
gonna be like it used to be and there's
no like firm and then the buyer and the
seller and it's basically we'll have to
rewrite a lot of rules and economics as
well for sure a lot of the assumptions
won't hold true same with who are the
who are the actors it's not just people
anymore it's machines absolutely we're
going to have to create entire new
concepts of how they do trade and how
they work with us too what kind of
barriers or roadblocks would you
imagine
are going to happen in the blockchain
space so at least when we we talk about
bitcoin there are some trust issues
there have been some hacks and uh
so there is obviously a need to to work
on on trust and feeling that it's uh
it's the safe technology yeah one of the
problems that bitcoin has faced is
bitcoins getting stolen or lost but a
lot of that actually comes from
people trying to recentralize bitcoin in
different ways making themselves
actually a pretty easy target absolutely
so education will be a big part before
we actually can use the technology very
in in the wide sense right yeah to
actually transition into the mainstream
and and make it useful for average
people to use we're going to need to
make sure we have
a lot more education a lot more
standards and probably work with a lot
of enterprises to create sort of the
user experience around this being a
technology that is safe and usable and
understandable what is the current state
of blockchain in your understanding
what's going to have to happen next the
current state is in this the research
state and it's being
developed to to be applied in many many
areas it might be used almost everywhere
to where like we won't even imagine how
we lived without it but i'm not sure
where it's going to go i mean no one
really knows right well we have a lot of
uh public blockchains
like we have bitcoin we have the
ethereum network
nxt but a lot of companies and
consortiums are getting together to
build
private blockchains so ones that are
more closed off at first and then may
evolve into a public network when people
feel comfortable using it and some are
also proof of concepts out in the real
world projects in energy and in
pharmaceuticals and in
retail and lots of different fields are
starting experiments and we'll see in
the next few years how all of those
interact and what we learn about the
best use cases for blockchain and what
it means for trade
so tell me your version of a technical
definition of blockchain
a technical definition of blockchain is
that it is
a persistent transparent public
append-only ledger
so it is a system that you can add data
to and not change previous data within
it
it does this through a mechanism for
creating consensus
between scattered or distributed parties
that do not need to trust each other but
just need to trust the mechanism by
which their consensus has arrived at
in the case of blockchain
it relies on some form of challenge
such that
no one actor on the network is able to
solve this challenge consistently more
than everyone else on the network so it
randomizes yes yeah it randomizes the
process and in theory ensures that no
one can force the blockchain to accept a
particular entry onto the ledger that
others disagree with one that
relies on a mechanism for a peer-to-peer
network that can maintain
updates to the ledger and then verify
those updates in such a way that it is
impossible to defraud and impossible to
alter after the fact and do you see it
as defining a new discipline of kinds or
where where are we going to see
blockchain emerge in the real world
first i mean just so like as an example
one thing that i think about a lot in
terms of possible blockchain
applications is electricity right the
next generation of distributed smart
grid technology effectively sure and
people are working on that already yeah
yeah exactly and it's this very fruitful
area of research and you can find
yourself looking like 20 years out right
where you have an enormous number like
of electric cars you have all of these
batteries like that's essentially
um a distributed
peak load power grid right like the cars
are getting plugged in and unplugged at
different times if you have a mechanism
that is able to
automatically and autonomously
be distributing power based on batteries
that are scattered throughout the grid
that are being used for other purposes
their owners don't even necessarily need
to be aware you begin to have something
that looks like a much more viable
society that still has a lot of
electricity needs but is able to base
that much more on renewables is able to
make up the difference during peak load
periods or during differences in weather
that is able to have power much closer
to where it's needed rather than having
to be distributed over great distances
like
that's something that would be an
enormously hard problem to solve and
it's not that the blockchain makes it
easy but it makes it possible a lot of
people are seeing blockchain in the news
and maybe seeing a lot of sort of
initial coin offerings this sort of
monetization opportunity around
blockchain and are getting very excited
about it and some of that excitement is
is real and should be you know
encouraged but some of it is also hype
how do you feel about the hype cycle
around blockchain today i'm glad you
mentioned initial coin offerings um
because for me those really exemplify
the sort of the the problem that we're
having at this exact moment they are a
an idea with enormous potential
significance down the road however the
promise of the initial coin offering has
been kind of hijacked into this string
of like basically pump and dump scams or
sort of desperate gold rush schemes the
faster that we can we can shift from
this this fantasy that it is going to
make you rich in a sort of you know
1920s tulip bubble kind of way um
is is that is the sooner that we can get
into people honestly and i mean this
like with all the hope in the world
people being disappointed in blockchains
like oh i didn't get rich it's just
being used now to make it easier to
transact goods and services safely
across borders this isn't exciting at
all and then we'll see that like become
part of the everyday infrastructure of
the world in a way that i think will be
very significant but i think it is now
almost every aspect of it that's
connected with the concept of money is
wildly overhyped um and
it also creates a problem which is
people get a lot of excitement around it
and then they're waiting for
[Music]
the world to change yeah right where
where is this technology why haven't i
seen anything changing yes yes because
we've had a lot of pr a lot of proof of
concept but yeah truthfully this is more
like a science right it will develop it
will take five years it will take 10
years that kind of time is necessary one
of the areas that brought me to supply
chain research is the fact that we're
we're not just going to see blockchain
emerge we're going to see artificial
intelligence continue to evolve we're
gonna see connected devices and this
sort of growing internet of things
machinery that can do a lot more and
have a wallet and transact on their own
and so
i actually think a lot of where
blockchain and other technologies are
headed is this interesting synergy that
will help us elevate the kinds of
institutions we've used in the past and
cobbled together to create that
identifiable
verifiable trust yes and one of the most
interesting ideas to me that came out of
the currency side of the blockchain
project was the notion around like
coloring coins right assign properties
to a particular coin
and in particular to assign those
properties in ways that would allow you
to do things like bring in the graph of
previous transactions you know there's
sort of an obvious application for this
which is something that would look a
little bit like an extreme version of
like a boycott divestment and sanctions
kind of approach right a model where
it's sort of like i will not touch money
my wallet will automatically not touch
money that has been exchanged with the
following as a sort of very extreme way
of cutting those things out but there's
also ways in which i think that could be
applied to to clearing out the entire
logistics process of many kinds of bad
actors but trying to make a supply chain
better in some ways relies a lot on
whose version of better that is and
exactly kind of what gets qualified but
also how that is quantified
within say some kind of like smart
contract system there's multiple ways
that i could see this backfiring and one
is the ways in which that is implemented
for example
leaving certain kinds of bad behavior
untouched or unanalyzed or one that
feels even more dire to me in some ways
is creating an extremely inflexible con
like because human contracts legal
contracts are actually very flexible
like there's a lot of kind of room to
move and renegotiate yeah but we we
already have
real world versions of some of these
nightmare scenarios right where like
your kid has a medical emergency and you
can't unlock your car because you're two
days behind on payments for it and so
the car system will no longer respond to
the app mechanism that you're supposed
to be able to use to drive it barrier
being sort of a rigidity in structures
that maybe don't accommodate real life
scenarios very well as you and i have
been talking one of the things that
keeps coming up is that we tend to hold
novel technologies to an unrealistically
high standard in terms of what they are
supposed to deliver rather than
comparing them to actually existing
systems where we can begin to see the
possibility that even like a slight
incremental improvement would still be
an enormous gain the system we have
today is also broken
right
it's it's hard to compare it to some
perfect future just like we compare
um you know autonomous vehicles to this
very high standard because machines are
doing it should be perfect right there
should be zero car deaths
and when you say well there's hundreds
of thousands millions of you know car
deaths on the road due to human error
today i think we're in a similar place
we're going to see problems with this
technology and we are going to need to
develop
multiple kinds of standards that also
have some flexibility
but it's it's going to also be a
version a system that
allows us to fix some of the things that
are broken today
blockchain may sound complicated but at
its core it's just another tool for
humans and eventually robots and other
kinds of identities to trade at scale
and make that trade more decentralized
and it's part of our future so it's
important that people have these kinds
of conversations and start to learn
about it
