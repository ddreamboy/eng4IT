What are cryptocurrency wallets? ⚡ ...and how do 
they work? 🤔 As we always discuss together on the  
channel, it is extremely important to protect 
our digital asset investments 🔐 by completely  
owning and controlling them 🔗 using our own 
cold storage hardware wallets!! 📲 🔑 However,  
besides finally deciding to take the plunge... 
opening up an account with a crypto exchange 🏦 and  
buying our first cryptocurrency 🚀 many people find 
the idea of setting up their own cryptocurrency  
wallets 📲 🔑 and transferring their crypto to it 
incredibly daunting!! 😱 Public keys ❌ private  
keys ❌ wallet addresses ❌ seed phrases ❌ secret 
phrases ❌ blockchain ❌ on chain ❌ off chain ❌ gas  
fees ❌ transaction fees ❌ ...different 
networks like Bitcoin ₿ versus Ethereum  
versus Solana... 😕 This new speculative 
tech is riddled with confusing jargon for  
newcomers!! 😮 And although it's a great sign that 
we are extremely early adopters of revolutionary  
tech with likely insane upside potential 🤑 ...it 
does take a fairly large investment of time and  
energy to wrap our heads around how it works!! 💫 
And lucky for us ☘️ ...by the end of this video,  
and for some maybe after watching it a few times 
over ⏮️ ...we will experience that "Eureka!"  
moment ‼️ ...where we finally understand how 
crypto wallets work!! 🤗 We're going to break down  
some important information about cryptocurrency 
wallet into simple and easy to understand concepts  
together 😎 Our goal by the end of this video, 
is that we feel more comfortable transferring  
our cryptocurrency off of exchanges into our own 
cryptocurrency wallets for safe keeping 🔗 ...and  
also explore different ways we can put our 
new knowledge into practice by doing small  
transactions between exchanges 🏦 ➜ 📲 and wallets, 
transferring crypto between different wallets  
we own 📱 ➜ 📲 ...also we are more confident and 
prepared for likely the last once in a lifetime  
opportunity to invest as an early adopter in 
cryptocurrency and blockchain technology 🤓 ...to  
achieve generational wealth 💥💰 Because big 
traditional financial players 🏦 are getting in,  
under-the-radar 📡 The mainstream media has been 
misinforming the public about crypto since its  
inception 🤞 So when the tides inevitably turn 
and tons of money starts flooding into this new,  
small asset class 💰🤑 ...we need to make sure we 
are in a position to reap the rewards of taking  
the time to watch videos like this ⌚ learning 
new complex things 🧩 practicing using new complex  
tech, so in the end we will have truly earned the 
potential life-changing gains over the next 18 to  
24 months 💥 By putting in the time, being brave 
and taking on risk 💪 and being part of something  
bigger than us... something that will help 
us build a better future together 🌴 Amazing,  
so what is a cryptocurrency wallet? 🔒 When we 
hear the word wallet, we immediately think of  
the pocket or purse accessories that hold our 
cash 💵, IDs, credit, and debit cards 💳 However,  
unlike cash, digital currencies are not stored 
in a specific location and do not exist in  
physical form. Instead, cryptocurrencies, account 
balances, and transactions exist on computers...  
a network of computers 🖧 using a blockchain 
or similar technological foundation. So what  
is blockchain? ⛓️ Blockchain is just a fancy term 
that describes a running ledger of transactions.  
Without losing sight of this video, if you would 
like to learn more about blockchain and why it was  
developed, you can check out my video guide for 
beginners by clicking on the link above 🖲️ ⬆ Nice,  
back to wallets a cryptocurrency wallet has 
software that creates and stores your private  
and public Keys interacts with the blockchain 
monitors your cryptocurrency balances and allows  
you to send and receive digital assets so to send 
receive store and monitor your cryptocurrency  
balances and other digital assets like nfts you 
need to use a cryptocurrency wallet and what's  
funny is we shouldn't really use the word wallet 
when talking about crypto because a wallet in  
the traditional sense makes us think of our cash 
actually physically inside of our wallet or our  
credit cards actually inside of our wallet while 
a cryptocurrency wallet is more accurately a key  
to access our phones because our cryptocurrencies 
and digital assets are not actually inside of our  
wallets they are on the blockchain which is a 
running Ledger of transactions distributed all  
around the world so in reality our crypto is 
basically assigned to our wallet's private key  
and our wallet gives us access to the crypto and 
the ability to view our balances send and receive  
crypto stake it interact with smart contracts Etc 
awesome hello I'm cryptocasian in this video we  
are going to explore how cryptocurrency wallets 
work the different types of cryptocurrency wallets  
available on the market and why it's important to 
use multiple cryptocurrency wallets to diversify  
the risks associated with investing in new 
speculative technology let's hit it [Music]

Ledger Fiasco tantrum has been swamped so orders  
have been backed up for a few weeks so pre-order 
one to get your spa in line for the next batch of  
wallets scroll down and use links below to access 
the correct and official sites as well as redeem  
any special offers they have for us so how do 
cryptocurrency wallets work we are going to go  
through a very simplified analogy to help us wrap 
our heads around around how cryptocurrency wallets  
work together please note this is not exactly how 
the technology works it's just an analogy so a  
simplified way to understand how cryptocurrency 
wallets work is to consider how your traditional  
online banking applications work imagine your 
bank is the blockchain your bank account number  
is the public key your crypto wallet is your 
online banking app and your online banking app  
login credentials are your private key so your 
bank records and tracks all the transactions  
going to and from your bank account just like the 
blockchain records and tracks all the transactions  
going to and from your public key using your 
online banking app you are able to check the  
balance of your bank account and send or receive 
transactions just like a cryptocurrency wallet  
allows you to check your balances and send or 
receive crypto however in order to log in to your  
online banking app you need to first type in your 
username and password which is like using your  
private key to access your cryptocurrency wallet a 
public key is similar to your bank account number  
in that if you provide anyone with your bank 
account number they can send you funds keep in  
mind that public keys are also commonly known as 
wallet addresses however having your bank account  
number alone would not allow someone to take funds 
from your account this is also how a public key  
works people can send cryptocurrency to you using 
your public key or public wallet address but they  
cannot take funds from you using your public key 
on the flip side giving your online banking app  
login credentials to someone would allow them to 
send funds from your bank account to somewhere  
else this is similar to a private key if you give 
someone your private key they can access your  
cryptocurrency and send it somewhere else unlike 
traditional banking if you give away your private  
key and your funds go missing you will likely 
not be able to recover them this is why it's  
so important to keep your private key private and 
before sending and receiving cryptocurr currency  
you must first make sure you are sending the same 
type of currency to a wallet address or public  
key that supports that particular cryptocurrency 
for example you can only send Bitcoin to bitcoin  
addresses and you can only receive ether 
from either addresses and the simplest way  
to understand why Bitcoin addresses only work with 
Bitcoin ether only works on ethereum Solana only  
works on Solana Etc is to think of them like 
software applications on Mac versus PC versus  
Linux or like Apple versus Android so they are 
just different Tech foundations using different  
code which is why Apple apps can't be installed on 
Android devices there has to be an Android version  
of the app to be supported on Android cool so if 
you have another person's public key or address  
you can easily send them some corresponding 
cryptocurrency and vice versa and when  
cryptocurrencies are sent or received no actual 
physical or digital exchange occurs between the  
wallets remember cryptocurrency wallets interact 
with the blockchain and the blockchain is where  
all cryptocurrency transactions are logged and 
it's also where balances are tracked so just to  
recap a cryptocurrency wallet has software that 
interacts with the blockchain stores your public  
and private Keys monitors your cryptocurrency 
balances and allows you to send and receive  
cryptocurrency nice what are the different types 
of cryptocurrency wallets there are many different  
types of cryptocurrency wallets to choose from and 
each of them have their own pros and cons let's  
break down crypto wallets into two categories 
hot and cold a hot wallet creates and stores  
your private Keys online while cold wallets create 
and store your private Keys offline so examples of  
hot law include desktop or mobile app software 
these wallets operate on your computers and cell  
phones which are connected to the internet so 
when you set up these wallets your private key is  
generated on a hot device which just means it's 
connected to the internet which could be more  
vulnerable to being compromised especially with 
AI scamming tactics becoming more sophisticated  
Etc however by far the least secure way to store 
large investments in cryptocurrency for the long  
term is on an exchange why well first of all it's 
online therefore hot therefore more vulnerable to  
hacks and on top of it cryptocurrency exchanges 
are huge targets for hackers since obviously  
there's a ton of potential crypto that can be 
stolen with any wallet we manage on our own  
a hacker has no idea how much potential funds 
there are to steal while crypto exchanges are  
a guaranteed Gold Mine of swords and second of 
all due to lack of transparency and regulation  
there is an artificial supply of crypto meeting 
real demand because exchanges lend out crypto  
you stake infinitely between other people and 
exchanges which basically means that one ether  
you are looking at on your account could also be 
the same either five other people on The Exchange  
are looking at meaning cryptocurrency exchanges 
don't actually have all the crypto backed one to  
one for all of their customers so if there was a 
massive run on exchanges where everyone wanted to  
move their Bitcoin and ether to their own wallet 
there would not be enough to go around like we saw  
with FTX there are also some bad players out there 
gambling with our funds we leave on the exchange  
and can go bust and third of all as we see with 
coinbase regulatory bodies like the SEC can go  
after them sue them demonetize them by forcing 
them to de-list a significant amount of crypto  
which would destroy their profits which puts 
them at risk of going under as we've discussed  
at length on the channel exchanges need to be used 
as a tool to exchange Fiat for crypto crypto for  
crypto and crypto to Fiat not for storing crypto 
Investments we need to be transferring any crypto  
we want to exchange to them and when we are done 
transferring our crypto back to our own wallets  
sweet now let's learn about the safest most ideal 
way to store significant amounts of cryptocurrency  
for the long term cold wallets cold wallets are 
also known as Hardware wallets Hardware wallets  
are designed to safely create and store your 
private key offline and when sending receiving or  
managing funds you will need to use the hardware 
wallet device and go through more security steps  
in general which makes your funds less vulnerable 
to theft by creating and storing private keys  
with Hardware wallets your funds are safer from 
hackers and other potential security issues that  
hot software wallets are more likely to experience 
so store your cryptocurrency on a hardware wallet  
is the safest most secure way to manage your 
funds so if you scroll down to the description  
area below you can access the correct and official 
site of my recommended Hardware wallets note there  
are two important things you need to know about 
buying a hardware wallet first only buy Hardware  
wallets from the real manufacturer do not buy used 
Hardware wallets and do not buy them from other  
other companies or individuals this is because 
hackers may buy a hardware wallet tamper with  
the software and resell the Hacked device to steal 
your phone and second as with all crypto related  
activities make sure you double and triple 
check the URL you are accessing to buy the  
hardware wallet make sure the address is correct 
and that it has an SSL or secure sockets layer  
which uses the https protocol instead of HTTP 
there are a ton of phishing scams online that  
will pretend to be the real website you intend 
to access and if you access a fake website you  
may lose your funds or receive a hacked wallet so 
again if you're interested in my recommendations  
using the links below get you where you want to 
go safely all while supporting the channel since  
Ledger's announcement of their recover Services 
software update to their devices tangent wallet  
an alternative that never reveals our private key 
or seed to anyone has been blowing up like I said  
there is a wait for the next batch of wallets so 
make sure to get your spa online earlier rather  
than later it looks like a credit card uses 
the highest standard of security among crypto  
wallets known as eal 6 Plus which is a level 
of protection used by NASA and in passports the  
source code for tangem's mobile app is all open 
and available for review on their GitHub which is  
important for full transparency to ensure there 
are no backdoors built in and that funds can be  
accessed if the company shut down for any reason 
instead of a seed phrase as the only way to back  
up our crypto wallets backup copies of the wallet 
are created and used on other tantrum cards that  
we encrypt with our own unique access code we 
create breach card also note the pricing for this  
cryptocurrency Hardware device is much cheaper and 
affordable than other ones starting at just over  
forty dollars with free shipping using our promo 
code this is a plus for any beginners just getting  
started or anyone who is looking to onboard 
friends and family into crypto with a simple  
easy to use secure self-custody wallet so scroll 
down and use link below to access tangents correct  
and official site as well as redeem any special 
offers they have for us cool and we can check out  
the step-by-step Tanger wallet setup guide to get 
a better idea about how tangent wallet creates and  
protects our private Keys differently than Ledger 
trezor and other wallets that use seed phrases by  
clicking on the link above since the vast majority 
of cryptocurrency wallets use seed phrases to back  
up our wallets and access our phones at large 
while we wait for the next batch of tangent  
wallets or wait for whatever Hardware wallet 
we've chosen to go with like Ledger treasure  
BC Vault to arrive let's create our own hot wallet 
together using a mobile app called trust wallet it  
transfers some crypto to it get ready we are about 
to have the Eureka moment we've all been waiting  
for about what happens if your phone dies or if 
your Hardware wallet breaks or if it's stolen  
Etc when it uses a seed phrase as backups let's 
in it how to set up your own crypto wallet in  
this video we are going to set up the trust wallet 
together on our mobile device step by step open  
the app store on your phone and type in trust 
wallet and click download and install it then  
open the app tap on create new wallet tap to check 
the box agreeing to the terms of service next we  
are going to create a passcode to add an extra 
layer of security when using the app then confirm  
the passcode by entering it again and now we are 
going to back up our secret phrase which is the  
master key to your wallet and anyone that has it 
can access your crypto so never share it which is  
why I recommend backing it up manually versus to 
your iCloud as it could pose more vulnerabilities  
if your iCloud is compromised so we are going to 
tap backup manually on the next screen the app  
gives us more information stating this secret 
phrase is the master key to your wallet tap on  
all check boxes to confirm that you understand the 
importance of your seed phrase tap the first box  
that read if I lose my secret phrase my funds will 
be lost forever tap the second box that reads if  
I expose or share my secret phrase to anyone my 
funds can get stolen and tap the third box that  
reads trust wallet support will never reach out to 
ask for it then tap continue and here are the 12  
words you need to write down in order and secure 
to protect any crypto use into it after these next  
few steps it will become clear how our crypto is 
on the blockchain and how private keys or recovery  
phrases are merely keys to access our funds that 
are on the blockchain and how anyone with these  
words can steal all of your funds if you do not 
properly secure these words these 12 words are  
the keys to your wallet literally by memorizing 
these 12 words you can carry access to hundreds  
and thousands millions and billions of dollars 
worth of crypto right here in your brain stay  
tuned for the end of this video when I show you 
how I can gain access to your funds using these  
12 words anytime and anywhere but regardless of 
whether you lose this particular phone or not it's  
for this reason I do not recommend backing this 
phrase up to iCloud which is something that could  
also be hacked I don't recommend ever storing your 
wallet private key on any device connected to the  
internet password manager or similar so don't 
take a screenshot of it or picture the best way  
is using good old-fashioned pen and paper for now 
securing it in multiple geographical locations in  
case of a fire flood or similar in this video 
we are just doing a simple short-term solution  
for storing our own crypto together to get it off 
of exchanges until we can get a hardware wallet  
so for now like I said I recommend writing 
your secret phrase down on paper and storing  
it somewhere extremely secure like a safe or 
inconspicuous like into your house in a book  
on a shelf or similar cool next we need to verify 
the secret phrase by tapping the words to put them  
next to each other in the correct order and we 
are done we have officially created our very own  
self-custody crypto wallet where we can completely 
own and control our digital assets using the trust  
wallet we can buy crypto deposit and store nfts 
and deposit crypto tap deposit now let's say  
we have some ether we can send to our new trust 
Wallet tap ethereum and from here we can scan the  
QR code or copy the address for our first example 
to show you how easy it is to use tangent wallet  
we are going to send some ether from tangent 
wallet to trustwallet so I'm going to tap the  
copy button to copy our trust ether address then 
I'm going to open tangem's mobile app and tap scan  
card then using my physical tangent Hardware 
Wallet card I'm going to tap it to my phone  
then enter my access code then tap the card again 
and here we are at our tangent wallet dashboard  
I'm going to tap ethereum TAPS in paste The Ether 
trust wallet address into the address field enter  
100 worth of ether looks like the network fee to 
process the transaction is about two dollars make  
sure everything looks good and tap send to verify 
the transaction I'm going to enter my access code  
again tap my tantrum card to my phone and success 
the transaction has been signed and sent to the  
blockchain so now if we open our trust Wallet 
app enter our passcode hear almost instantly on  
the trust wallet dashboard we see the hundred 
dollars worth of ether has a wrap amazing next  
here comes the part that will probably be a 
lot easier than you think transferring your  
crypto from The Exchange to your new self-custody 
mobile wallet for Simplicity I'm going to assume  
your crypto is on coinbase in this guide however 
no matter which exchange you use you should be  
able to log in choose a send function and follow 
similar steps to move your crypto on your computer  
or phone log into your Exchange in this guide 
I'm accessing The coinbase Exchange app on a  
mobile device on the coinbase mobile app dashboard 
TAPS in let's say we want to send Bitcoin from The  
Exchange to our trust wallet so tap Bitcoin and 
on the Trust app tap Bitcoin to see the QR code or  
or copy the address in this video we are scanning 
the QR code like so then tap continue enter the  
email of Bitcoin to send I always recommend that 
beginners and seasoned crypto investors alike  
send a small amount to a new wallet first to make 
sure everything goes smoothly before sending large  
amounts in this video we are going to send 100 
worth tax preview make sure everything looks good  
the fee will be about 73 cents it'll take about 30 
minutes to complete the transfer tap send now if  
you have 2fa setup enter the six digit code from 
your authenticator app and it's been successfully  
sent tap done and we can see after a few minutes 
the Bitcoin has arrived to our trust wallet  
brilliant here we are we now are in complete 
control of our Bitcoin and ether where it's  
stored on the blockchain and we are the only ones 
with keys to access it rather than it merely being  
an amorphous pool of Bitcoin controlled by the 
exchange so secure your secret phrase and repeat  
these steps to transfer all of your cryptocurrency 
currency on exchanges you're looking to hold for  
the long term to your new mobile wallet that 
is until your Hardware wallet arrives now for  
the Eureka oh my God I finally get it moment as it 
relates to secret phrases and access to our crypto  
let's just say I come across your 12 words and 
just your 12 words not your phone not your address  
or passwords or anything that has any connection 
with you to it at all if I found a piece of paper  
in the middle of the street with these 12 words 
and I wanted to take your crypto this is how it  
can be done you can pretty much use almost any 
other mobile crypto Wallet app to do this quickly  
in this example I'm going to download another 
crypto mobile app called Exodus next I'm going  
to open the app but instead of choosing to create 
a wallet I'm going to select I have a wallet and  
on the restore wallet screen I'm going to select 
secret phrase and start typing in the 12 words on  
this paper I randomly found on the street note 
that while it's like Ledger and trezor create  
24 words and you can do the same exact thing if I 
found your 24 word Ledger private key I can do the  
same exact thing and take all of your funds cool 
okay so all 12 words are entered and now I'm going  
to tap continue and restart to restore this wallet 
after a minute or so we've been notified that  
the restore was successful in voila here is the 
hundred dollars of Bitcoin and hundred dollars of  
ether we sent to our new trust wallet but since we 
didn't secure our 12 words I was able to download  
another crypto Wallet app and restore access 
to it using just the 12 words from here I can  
easily send the funds elsewhere to another wallet 
I control and you do not effectively stealing all  
of your crypto and digital assets that fast and 
that simple check it out here's the Bitcoin and  
it's gone and here's the ether and it's also gone 
the next time we open our trust wallet we set up  
but did not secure properly we can see our balance 
is zero that's why it's so important to guard your  
private key recovery phrase 12 or 24 words 
whatever you've got and to consider getting a  
horror wallet that generates a private key offline 
and stores it offline for maximum security or we  
can also consider different wallets that do not 
use seed phrases that can easily be stolen or  
in some cases we can be socially engineered or 
tricked by scammers that pretend to be Ledger  
or similar and try to have us type in our seed 
phrases into a big website or by having us text  
them or email them our seed phrase then by similar 
steps we just went through using the words to  
drain your wallet wallets that use alternative 
ways to secure crypto wallet private keys are  
BC Vault and tangent wallet for example with the 
tangip wallet the private keys are actually never  
exposed to anyone ever so if I found your tandem 
wallet randomly on the street and downloaded the  
tangent Wallet app and scan the card the the 
requirement of an access code prevents me from  
accessing your crypto and sending it elsewhere 
to steal it at the end of the day with this new  
speculative technology it's important to 
diversify where we store our crypto long  
term by using several different types of wallets 
so we don't experience a total loss if something  
happened to Ledger vs trust wallet versus BC Vault 
or tangent so be sure to scroll down and use the
