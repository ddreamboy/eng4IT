hey everyone my name is rob and today
we're going to be using python to do
some object detection using yolo v5 if
you've never heard of yolo before it
stands for you only look once and it's
an open source package for doing object
detection it comes with pre-trained
models so it can do some object
detection just out of the box you can
also fine-tune it on your own data set
if you want to do custom object
detection i first came across yolo v5
when working on some kaggle competitions
with object detection and it really
currently is the state of the art there
is a lot built into it that makes object
detection just easy to do so we're going
to walk through that and see how it goes
today okay so here i am on the yolo v5
github repository you can see that it's
a pretty active repository and they do
have description here of what it is
and have some official documentation to
get started with it the first thing we
actually need to do is clone this repo
now i'm working on my desktop machine
which is a linux machine
running ubuntu 2004 and i also have
two gpus in this machine that
the yolo v5 will use to predict
it also uses
pi torch as the back end where all the
models were trained and we will actually
set up a new environment here that will
run yolo v5 and have all the correct
packages installed so i'm switching over
here to my handy terminal and i'm in my
directory where i like to clone my
repositories and all i'm going to do is
run this
git clone here
now it's recommended too that you have
anaconda installed right now i i have
anaconda installed on this machine and
that'll let me create a brand new conda
environment
for yolo v5 so what it uh says to do
next is just a cd into this directory
where
i cloned and if i do lctr we could see
these are all the
files from this github repository that
we have cloned
and then i'm actually gonna uh conda
create
uh with the name yolo v5 so i'm going to
create a fresh new conda environment
where we can
install all the required packages so i
just do that by doing connor create dash
name i named it yolo v5 and i do need
two dashes here in the name and i'll
type yes
to install all these dependencies okay
so in order to activate this conda
environment i just do conda activate
yolo v5
activated in this environment and you
can see because it says yolo v5 i also
ins made sure i installed python 3.8
because the docs for yolo v5 do say it
needs at least three
seven it looks like
so now that i'm in here i can just pip
install all the requirements that are in
this requirements text if you want to
just look in the requirements text these
are all the
packages that it will install and it'll
make sure i install
all the right versions
so this might take a little while
because it's going to have to download
some of the wheels if it's your first
time
installing these packages
and it needs to run through and install
them all
okay so it looks like it's done
installing them all so i'll just clear
this screen if you look over in the repo
in this detect dot pi
we could see that it actually
can be called just from python
with some arguments so
by default it will
pick certain weights to use so
yolo v5 comes in different sizes let's
look and see what sizes of the weights
that we have as options yeah so they're
shown here yolo v5 the smallest is n and
the largest is x and it looks like
there's even a new one efficient debt
version of it
and what else are we gonna get it we're
gonna need to provide it the source now
i wanna provide it this
my webcam to see if it will run directly
on my webcam and we just provide
the number where the webcam is
associated so if you only have one
webcam you'll be putting in zero here
and we'll see how that that works and
we're not actually providing any data
to train on so we don't have to worry
about this
that's all we really need i think
okay so i think i have it working here
the command that i needed to run was
just python detect and then i'm using
source five which is my second webcam
and i have a green screen here behind me
so it's going to show the green screen
when it loads up let's try running this
detect and see how it works
we can see that it is using
the small version of uh
yolo weights but there we are so you can
see me there's a person here's my oh it
thinks my fingers are carrots
thumbs up uh let's hold up let's take
off my glasses is it no glasses tennis
racket all right not perfect not perfect
um
phone
cell phone it's good at that
uh maybe
a cup
cup okay yeah that's pretty good
and you can see the confidences are
shown
on the side of the image so it's drawing
the bonding box and showing the side but
if you wanted to pull out just the the
bounding boxes you could do that as well
or store any information from yellow b5
by going into the source code
cool so we're going to kill that and
let's try to load the larger weights
because the larger weights are going to
mean that it performs more accurate and
it's might be a little bit slower but
it's going to perform better so
what we need to do to get the larger
weights is run python detect and then
feed in the yolo v5x weights and then
give it the same source
now you can see it's actually
downloading these weights
fusing the layers
all right and now we're back to my
object detecting you can see the chair
it sees the corner of the chair it knows
this is a comp a lot better
does it think my fingers are still no
it's pretty good about my fingers maybe
if i just hold my hand no it thinks i'm
a person cell phone
this is just working on the default
pre-trained weights but if you wanted to
does it know this is a microphone but
you can make it more customizable by
fine-tuning the training on a different
data set that's pre-labeled
there we go look that's pretty good it's
pretty confident of all the things
now let's try to run it on video data
set so i do have this data set which is
a video
footage of a bunch of different cars
driving around and i'm used this for a
different youtube video that i created
on working with
video data but let's try to run
this object detection on this video and
see how it works we're going to call
this again but instead of giving it a
source we're going to give it the
desktop
mp4 file
okay so it looks like it's running
and it's detecting people bicycles cars
so what it's doing here is it's running
now on this data set
it has
the number of frames that it's gone
through of the entire video
and the number of people that it sees
cars these are just some of the labels
coming out here printed to our command
line
so it looks like you can provide a view
image
like this
in order to actually view the images as
its processing
yeah there we go it's a little bit
slower
but it is working we see that it's
detecting all these different cars and
objects even detecting the traffic light
which is really impressive
so if i kill this now
i can um change other
settings like the confidence threshold
and the iou threshold so if we only want
it to show objects that it's very
confident of it's defaulted to 0.25 but
let's change that confidence threshold
to 0.9
and run that
there now it's detecting much less
because the threshold that it needs to
detect in order to show needs to be at
least 0.9
let's do 0.5
okay that looks pretty good
and then there's also something called
an iou threshold and this basically
means
uh it's it will suppress
any
objects that it detects that overlap
each other so iou has to do with the
overlapping of two detected objects
let's do 0.9 for the iou threshold
is
0.5 so what's happening here is when we
set the iou confidence to be really low
it won't allow any boxes to be
overlapping each other very much it'll
just suppress any object detection that
overlaps with another object detection
so by turning this off and setting it
really high will allow for a lot of
overlapping boxes and let's do one last
run with a really low confidence
threshold and a high iou threshold
there we go so this is a lot of
different boxes and
even this car that it's detecting in the
lower right side
is very low confidence but it's
displaying it because we've set that
confidence threshold so low
thanks for watching this video it's a
short introduction to using yolo v5 both
on a webcam and processing videos for
object detection if you enjoyed this
