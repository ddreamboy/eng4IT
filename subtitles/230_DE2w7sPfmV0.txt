My name is
Shannon Ellis.
I am an assistant teaching
professor in HDSI,
so the Halicioglu Data
Science Institute
in the Cognitive
Science Department.
I focus mainly on teaching
large undergraduate data science
and programming courses to
our wonderful undergraduates
here at UC San Diego.
[MUSIC]
This question should
be way easier than it actually
is because it's hotly
debated in the field.
Everybody has their
own definition.
Mine, I try to keep
it simple and sweet.
Data science, to me,
is the scientific process of
extracting value from data.
That value could be monetary,
but it also could be
value in the context
of knowledge or gained
information in some way.
[MUSIC]
Data science is
relevant now for as many reasons
as you could possibly think of.
We are awash in data.
Our phones are constantly
collecting data on us.
Every time we send an email,
that's a whole bunch of data.
So we have more data than
we've ever had before,
both on the individual level
and at the population level,
just with the way technology
has gone over the
past few decades.
Having these data mean that
we can then extract more value.
We can ask more
interesting questions.
Think of your favorite
field, and there's
a data science question and
a data science approach
to answer that question.
Simply by having the
data, and having
the technology and the ways
to store the data and
process the data,
we're able to ask way
more interesting questions
than we used to.
[MUSIC]
I do actually have
an aha moment.
As an undergraduate, I was
a biology major, and I
was working with somebody named
Jeremiah [inaudible] at King's
College in Wilkes-Barre,
Pennsylvania, so this tiny
liberal arts college.
He and I worked together
for four years.
I had done research with him.
He knew I had an
interest in genetics.
He knew I wanted to do research.
We worked on these little
things called microarrays.
You extract RNA, and then
you put a whole bunch of
washes over top of them,
and the end, you get this tiny,
little slide that the
colors on it represent
the relative levels of
expression for this thing
that we're studying,
which is called Cryptococcus
neoformans fungus.
All of that said, I spent
months preparing these slides.
Then we took the slides
to a scanner, and we put
them through the
scanner, and it took
a picture of my slide,
and that picture was my data.
I had spent months pipetting
things in little tubes,
not really seeing what was
going on to get this picture.
So I hold a bunch of
these pictures and
then there was a
software that we
used to analyze the data.
I entered my pictures and
out came the results.
I was, like, what just
happened when I
clicked that button?
I asked my professor, I
said, what's going on?
How did it go from that picture
to those numbers
to those results?
He said to me, if you
weren't about to graduate,
I would teach you Python.
I thought to myself,
note to self,
go Google that when you get back
because I didn't know
what Python was.
I Googled Python. I
learned it was a
programming language.
At that aha moment, I was, like,
I want to understand
analysis so that I don't
have to trust this
piece of software,
even though it might
be trustworthy.
I want to understand
what's happening in
that black box when I click
"Go" to get my results.
At that point I was,
like, I'm going
to continue on research
because that's what I want
to do at the time, doing
something that I will
learn to do computation,
whatever that meant, until I
chose graduate programs
where there was
a deep statistical set of
courses and that I
would be able to join
a lab where I would
learn computation.
That was my aha moment
where I was, like,
how did it decide those
things for me, after I spent
months, in a second to come
up with those answers?
[MUSIC]
I sometimes joke
with other people who ask about
my job, and I say it's really
easy because data science is
that hot thing that all the
students want to learn.
Nobody is going to come
into my class and be, like,
when am I ever
going to use this,
because students have
this understanding
that these skills are
applicable as they go forward.
But in the classroom,
it changes a ton.
Students come in thinking and
knowing that they're
interested in this concept
of data science without having
a full and deep understanding
of what that means.
For example, they come
in, and they're like, AI,
machine learning, that's
the hot new thing.
I want to do that.
I try to rein them
in a little bit in the
classroom, and I'm, like,
the techniques used for
machine learning problems
are super interesting.
But let's spend the time talking
about the ethical approaches.
What do you need to
think about the data,
are your data complete,
and to really think about
all those steps leading up
to using your new favorite
machine learning algorithm,
trying to add the context, and
the ethics, and the
deep thinking students
need so that they
can go on to do
those interesting
algorithmic approaches
that they want to do,
and that's what I try to
do inside the classroom.
[MUSIC]
The specific challenges
for accessing information,
I have a few thoughts, and
they're not all tied together.
For the first one,
I'm going to put on
my biology hat and
my genetics hat,
which is what my background is.
There, if you got
government funding in
the United States and wanted
to publish your work,
it has been established
for a while
that you have to make
the data public.
The data are available, and
this is so that
others can either
reproduce your work or
replicate your work, or
so that others can use the data
in some other way
that works for them.
So the data are there,
but often they're in
these huge systems.
They're not well annotated,
meaning, you don't
know much about
the data or the sample
that it came from,
or they're hard to
get out. You still
have to do a ton of processing.
They take a ton of space.
There's access issues.
Not that the data aren't
there for you to use,
but more it's not a trivial
process to actually use them.
I think that's one side of
the spectrum that's actually
an easier to access issue.
The other side,
in the classroom,
in one of my courses,
we do group projects.
I don't do them.
My students do group
projects that I ask them to
do, and I have them
start with the question.
I tried to tell them, think
of a topic that you're
interested in that would
help your community,
would help your family,
that would help
large society and they can
choose whatever they want.
They have to come up
with their question
before they go find their data.
Sometimes they come up with
really interesting questions,
but the data are going
to be proprietary,
meaning, a company has
those data for sure.
You want to analyze
the sentiments people are
saying on Twitter over
some period of time and look
at how it corresponds to
politics, for example.
Twitter has what's
known as an API,
so you can get some
data from Twitter.
But if you work inside Twitter,
you would have access
to a lot more data.
I'm using Twitter as
an example there for
very good reasons.
Companies don't give you
access to all of their data,
both for monetary
reasons that they
have and for privacy reasons.
I'm not saying it's
a problem so much
as the barrier is sometimes
you have a really great idea,
the data exist,
but they just don't exist to
you, and so you just won't
be able to access them.
[MUSIC]
Typically, my work
starts with a question.
There's something
I want to answer,
and I try to mimic that
for students as well
because it can be really
easy to go search
on the Internet for
an available dataset and
then form a question
around that,
but that's not really what
you end up doing at work.
Your company actually is
going to be, like, go look at
the data and see
what you can ask.
Typically, they're
going to say, we have
these benchmarks
we want to ask a question about,
but we want to see why
this isn't working
as intended, and you
answer that question.
So for me, it starts
with a question, and
then it starts with,
do I have the data to answer it,
and simultaneously, do I have
the knowledge background
to answer it?
This is something I also
try to teach students.
You can ask a really
interesting question.
But if you've never thought
about that topic before,
you have to do your
due diligence.
You need to do
background research.
You need to read
other publications,
you need to get some
knowledge in that area
before you can do any analysis.
[MUSIC]
In my own work now, I
mostly ask questions about
the classrooms that I teach in,
and so it's a whole other
can of worms. I have the data,
it's a handful of questions.
One is, what can I use
these data for ethically?
A lot of working with
the IRB, which is
the Institutional
Review Board, which is
a great body that exists at
every academic institution,
and so I tell them what
I want to do and they
tell me if that's okay
and they are experts,
so they are great people
to get to know. Then the
second is there's a ton of
variability in education.
Every quarter, every term,
I have different students,
so how can I compare
this term to
last term when it's
not the same people?
What if I want to
change up how I
ask one question on a survey,
or clearly my exams aren't
the same from one
quarter to another,
so it's not as much as
the data accessibility
but what information do
these data have, and
what can I use, and
what should I not ask,
and what should I not
use, and talking to the
experts there as well.
Me asking questions
of my students
doesn't put them nearly at
as much risk as like me opening
up someone's skull and
doing brain surgery.
Of course, not every biological
human subject research
is opening up someone's brain,
but there's less inherent risks.
So there are different procedures
that you go through with
the IRB just because
the risks are lower.
When I submit things to the IRB,
they want to see the
surveys I'm asking.
They want to see what
I've communicated to
students about how
their data are going
to be used and what those
students expectations were.
They're really coming at it with
the lens of protecting students
and student information while
at the same time
knowing and just being
realistic that these
students are being
put at as much risk
as they could be in other
human subjects research.
We do have different paths
and different avenues there,
but there they are protecting
students, and they're
protecting student's
privacy as well,
making sure how are we
going to anonymize data?
Is it truly anonymized?
Is something identifiable,
even if you remove
their names, for
example? It is a different lens.
It is not as thought of
harm and risk, even though
of course they're trying to
protect students as some
human subjects research,
but I found the process to
be really thoughtful. Every time
I submitted something
and gotten something
back being like, Did
you think of this?
How are you handling
this? Have you considered
about this identification
process from the IRB?
It's just made me more
thoughtful through
the process as well.
When I think about data
access and data flow;
getting the data sometimes
easier than others,
once you have the
data and you've
determined that it can
answer your question
I try to encourage
my students and
myself to do tons of
exploratory data analysis.
By that I mean get to
know your data deeply.
Who has missing information?
What are the typical values?
Does anybody have
a value that looks
way off, and there could
have been an error?
If something's missing, is it
missing at random,
or is it missing
not at random, and how are
we going to consider that?
This is deep. Get to know your
data to convince yourself
even further that it is the data
you need to answer
that question.
It's a really important
part of this data flow.
Sometimes it's
circular, where you're,
like, "Do this exploration."
You're like, "These
aren't what I need.
I either need to go back and
do a different experiment,
or I need to go back and talk to
the company about the data
that they have and
this isn't going to
work or a different format."
That process often doesn't
show up in your resulting work.
You don't talk about, in
your report or your paper,
all the things that
failed in the middle, and
that's just part of the process,
so I like to talk about that.
You make mistakes, your
question is not great,
you didn't get the
data you need,
you explore it and realize
you didn't have enough,
and you have to go back
to the drawing board and
either ask a different question
because you're not going
to answer it or get different
data to be able to see
the process through to
the end where you do
the analysis and you write
the report or you
write the paper.
In graduate school I was
analyzing the genetic
basis of autism.
I was in a lab at a School
of Medicine, and we had
samples from individuals who
are affected with autism
and those who were not,
and these were
postmortem samples.
So these are individuals
who had passed away
and who had donated
their brains to science,
and I was analyzing these data.
The closest I got to
the autistic population
was looking at this
spreadsheet of
information I knew about
these people which gave me
very little
information about who
they were or even what
their "autism" was.
We know it's this huge spectrum.
I wasn't there integrated
with the autistic community.
I wasn't asking
about their needs.
I wasn't communicating
with them.
I'm, like, "If I'm
doing this research,
what is it that you,
as a community,
feel you want and
feel you need?"
I think we're having a
reckoning right now that,
that needs to be true, regardless
of who you're studying,
or who you're working with,
or who you're developing for.
For example, if you're
developing for the
disability community,
individuals with a
disability you're trying to
address should be part of
the process from
start to finish,
not just answering questions
but probably on your
engineering team.
Probably they're in the room
as you're doing development,
as you're doing better testing,
as you're launching
this into the world.
Even if you think
you have the world's
best idea, and you're
going to make this brilliant
startup around it,
make sure you've talked to
the people who are trying to
help before you come
up with this product.
That's what I try to
teach my students,
that's what I'm excited
for us to do better,
is to make sure those that we're
helping, or innovating for,
or developing for are
just part of the
process throughout.
The barriers are
somewhat historical,
so we all know the stories of
the largest tech companies
that are starting up.
Maybe we don't all know about
the demographics of individuals
who get venture capital funding,
but I can tell you that
the diversity has
just not been there.
I don't think it's for
malintent necessarily,
I think it was people have
an idea, and they want to
innovate on that idea.
People have been
willing to fund that,
and they hit the ground,
and run with it.
I think part of
the barriers are just
awareness, is the first one.
If you're not aware
that you should probably
have other people as part of
your team and how that can make
your team and your
product better overall,
then you wouldn't think to go
in that direction and
you would just hire
your friends who happened to
be people that looked
like you in college.
We've had some of that
historical pressure.
Another part is
economical in that if you
start a startup you have
very few people
in the beginning,
and often you're not
making a ton of salary
in the beginning.
Only certain people from
certain backgrounds
can afford to not make a ton
of money for a whole year.
Now sometimes these founders
end up making tons of
money down the line,
but you need that
ability in the beginning
to take that risk and
obviously that's going to limit
large swaps of our population.
I do teach hundreds and
thousands of students each year.
I think that the biggest
impact I'll have is
by teaching others how
to consider the
ethical implications
of their work throughout
their entire process.
That doesn't just mean,
are you allowed to
have these data?
It means, should you use these
data to ask that question?
Are you protecting individuals
in collecting the data
and storing the data?
Are you looking for biases
and the results
of your analysis?
Teaching that throughout
the entire process
because data is
the through line,
I think that's where I'll have
the most important role
in this when it comes
to data access,
and teaching that,
and giving examples,
and making sure it's a theme
throughout my course and
not just 20 minutes
in a lecture one day.
That's what it looks like to me,
is continuing to teach this and
demonstrate it to
the next-generation.
In my own work, I hope to have
access to the data
that I need to
answer the questions
that I'm interested in,
but if it's not that data that I
should have, I hope that
the other experts in
that field are the ones asking
the questions that I
set out to ask, or I
collaborate with them.
I think that secondary though
to making sure that my students
are thinking about this
as they go forward
and acting upon it.
This field has moved
quickly and even if you
think about Google there's
move-quickly-break things.
I'm excited to
reign things back,
pull things in,
and think deeply.
There is a huge field of
AI ethics and machine
learning ethics.
I'm not an ethics expert,
and this is not necessarily
where I did my
dissertation by any means,
but I'm excited for
those voices to
continue to get heard,
and to get more exposure,
and to be valued
inside of companies.
I'm painting large spinning
broad strokes here.
I have prioritized this
ability to innovate,
and embrace new technology,
and learn more about what
your preferences are,
so they can give
you advertisements.
Companies, and analysts,
and data scientists
have found that fun.
I'm excited for us to take a
look back, be introspective,
and make sure that those systems
are not harming individuals,
not harming certain populations.
I would say we're
at this crossroads
right now where
those people exist,
and they are knowledgeable,
and they are speaking out,
but they are not necessarily
being listened to
as much as they should be,
and so I'm excited for
companies to embrace
these individuals and academics.
They tend to have
academic jobs often,
but for both academics
and companies to embrace
this idea that we need to think
carefully about the products
we put out in the world.
We need to check for bias. We
need to make sure
we're not harming
groups or individuals
within marginalized groups.
Probably not what
most data scientists
would say they're
most excited about,
but it is what I'm
most excited about.
