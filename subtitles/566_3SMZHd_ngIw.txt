hey everyone welcome to this session by
simply learn in this video we dive
deeper into rpa by creating and
executing a simple bot
so let's go ahead and look at what's in
store for us
we will cover topics like why rpa what
is rpa what is not rpa how does rpa work
rpa software tools what is ui path
uipath components and a simple hands-on
demo so why exactly rpa now consider a
tech support unit that addresses
hundreds of queries on the daily the job
is to mainly guide the customer to the
appropriate tech unit to help resolve
the issues now most of their work that
they do is basically strenuous
repetitive and monotonous and not to
mention time consuming now rpa can
diminish the workload of the human help
desk by automating straightforward and
definitive tasks complex administrative
tasks like fault remediation and regular
diagnostics can also be automated
all in all rpa reduces human workload
and implements tasks effectively and
efficiently so moving on to the most
important question what exactly is rpa
robotic process automation is the use of
software with artificial intelligence
and machine learning capabilities to
handle high volume repetitive tasks that
previously required humans to perform
now some of these tasks could be
addressing queries making complex
calculations maintenance of records or
even maintenance of transactions
now to give you a better understanding
let's look at an example consider the
onboarding of a recruit into an i.t
company data collection is a crucial
part of the process with that
information a new user account email
address and access rights are generated
with robotic process automation the user
account can automatically activate a
template for the onboarding workflow now
rpa can assess prepare create new joiny
data initiate mailing of offer letters
and streamline the entire information
across the systems so tasks that
previously required asked to perform can
now be done within a few seconds with
the help of rpa
stats show that rpa automation and
accuracy can be increased to 100 percent
and the processing speed can be made 10
times faster rpa tools like uipath and
blue prism among others are now being
deployed at top it firms
so when you hear the term robotic in rpa
it's ledger to assume that it involves
robots that perform human tasks while
this is partially true there are certain
misconceptions so what are they so what
is not rpa
rpa bots are not humanoid robots they do
not have a physical form unlike robots
like sophia these bots cannot entirely
replace humans they are still controlled
and monitored by us and lastly they do
not possess human cognitive skills they
lack logical thinking and cannot make
decisions on their own which by
extension makes them incapable of
replacing humans
now that we have a clear understanding
of what rpa is and what it's not you
must be wondering how it works so let's
have a closer look at its working
the first step towards any approach is
planning in this stage the processes to
be automated are defined which includes
identifying the test objects finalizing
an implementation approach and defining
a clear roadmap for the rpa
implementation next we have design and
development
as the name suggests in this phase you
start developing the automation
workflows as per the agreed plan third
is deployment and testing this phase
typically includes the execution of the
bots now any expected outages are to be
taken care of during the deployment to
ensure accurate functioning testing of
these bots for bugs and errors is
crucial
lastly is support and maintenance now
providing constant support helps in
identifying and rectifying the errors
better
moving on we have rpa software tools now
these tools typically help develop and
execute bots some of the rpa tools are
uipath blue prism automation anywhere
work fusion among others in this
tutorial we will execute a bot using the
uipath tool
before executing a demo test case let's
go ahead and understand what uipath is
and its interface
uipath is basically an advanced rpa tool
which allows you to create control and
execute front office and back office
bots with the help of visual templates
and diagrams now it also provides
end-to-end automation calling it hyper
automation uipath offers three different
product suites first up we have ui path
studio now it is a platform to create
automation bots it encompasses hundreds
of activity templates and ready-made
components to drag and drop now some of
its features include gui dashboard which
basically consists of activities like
send email display message and so on it
offers different types of recorders to
record user actions on multiple
platforms it provides logging and
exceptional handling it also has
reusable components now the user can
create these reusable components to
publish them together as libraries the
next product suite is uipath robot now
they run automation bots that are
created using uipath studio there are
different types of robots firstly we
have the attended robots now these
robots work with you to speed up the
service desk and the help desk it's
basically used in activities where human
involvement is key next up we have
unattended robots now they operate
without the human touch maximizing the
cost and performance benefits for any
variety of back office tasks the third
product suite is the orchestrator now it
is a centralized robot management
dashboard where you can easily deploy
secure and manage your ui path robots at
scale now here's the course of action
the first step is that the user creates
a bot next the user has to save this
project and which is later used as a
process now once the process is created
it is assigned to a specific robot to
execute it this collectively constitutes
a job and all of which is taken care of
by the uipath orchestrator now let's
understand the uipath interface in brief
first up we have the recorder now as the
name suggests this component allows the
user to record all user actions such as
navigations clicks etc next up is
scraping now it involves two components
one is the screen scraping which is the
programmatic collection of visual data
and the other one is data scraping which
is the extraction of structured data
from an application user events now all
mouse clicks and key strokes given by
the user as input are recorded using
this feature lastly we have variables
now variables are used primarily for
using certain features now these
variables hold different types of data
and can change over time all right now
that we have a fair understanding of ui
path let's go ahead and execute a simple
test case so here's what we're going to
be doing first we extract information
about books on the website that is
goodreads.com so what information are we
extracting so we're going to be
extracting the names and the authors of
the new released books then this
information is going to be stored in an
excel sheet and this excel sheet is
going to be sent over an email so let's
go ahead and execute the test case all
right so let's go ahead and open ui path
studio and here
you go and click on new process in the
top right corner
all right and provide a name for it say
rpa
and i say create
so now this is going to create a
workspace for you this might take up a
few seconds
and this is what the typical uipath
studio interface looks like so moving
ahead we need to create a sequence of
activities so for that let's go ahead
and say new sequence to the top left
corner and provide a name for it i
choose to keep it sequence so i say
create
but what exactly is a sequence now
sequence is a set of activities so all
the activities mentioned in a sequence
are executed in the same order all right
so now in our use case we are going to
be scraping data from the goodreads.com
website right okay so now we'll have to
navigate to the goodreads.com website
and i've opened it in my browser
so here we've navigated to the most
popular books published in march 2020 so
now i have to extract data from this
right i need
two fields basically i need the name
of the book and the author
all right so what we're going to do is
we go back to uipath studio and click on
data scraping so go ahead and click on
data scraping
and here it says open your browser or
application and wherever you want to
extract your data from and then we click
on next and then click on the field that
you want to select
so i say next and here i want just the
name right so i click on the name
and it says you selected an entire table
cell would you like to extract the data
from the whole table no i just want the
name of the table right so i say no
and now the next thing you need to do is
you have to create a pattern the tool
needs to understand what exactly you are
extracting so what we do is we have to
create a pattern
to do that we have to select a second
element so i say next again
and i click on the second name here i
say click and now the name of the column
that i want to give so i say
books and i say next
now so this is how it's going to look
this is the data preview
right so next we need the name of the
author so i say extract correlated data
here
so go ahead and click on that
and now i need the name so i say i click
on sarah j maas
and again to create a pattern i need to
select another element so i say next and
click on the next name of the author so
i click on this
and i
give the name author for this column all
right so i click on next
okay so this is how it's going to look
so after this i say finish
all right so now it's going to ask me if
data is spanning across multiple pages
now in our case if you look at this
page
data is not spanning across multiple
pages say suppose you had one two three
four five saying there are more books
ahead then that would be data spanning
across multiple pages so that is not the
case here so i say no in our case
and that is it
so we have scraped our data from the
website okay so now that we're done with
data scraping the information that has
been extracted has to be saved in a csv
file
so for that you have to create the file
so go to your activities and say write
csv
all right so just drag and drop
the activity here
now it asks for two fields right so the
first one is a target field where the
information is stored so provide a name
for it for that let's go ahead and
browse it
and
in my case
i create a document say demo
one
underscore rpa
and save it
all right and the next field is a write
from field now the information that
you're storing in the csv file is
basically the output of data scraping so
that is all the information from the
data scripting event is stored in an
output variable so click on that and
here you see you have an output variable
so copy the output variable control c
and then paste it here
all right now save the file and now
let's execute it to see if it
successfully works
so
go ahead and click on play
so all right it's completed the
execution so let's go ahead and check
if it has completed the execution
correctly so i go back to my documents
ui path and we have demo one underscore
rpa
open that
and
here we go
we have the name of the author
and the book all right so this works
completely fine
okay so the next step in our use case is
to attach the csv file and send over an
email
now for that you have to provide your
credentials that is your email id and
the password now these credentials are
also used multiple times across the test
case so instead of specifying it every
time we can create two variables right
one for the email id and one for the
password so for that click on variables
here
and say create variable
and
okay we have one already here so let's
call it email
and the other one
is called
password
so go ahead and provide your credentials
so i provide my email id
and then my password
okay and then save it
all right now we have to attach this csv
file and send over an email right for
that we have an activity
called send smtp mail message
so go ahead and drag and drop it here
and now it has three fields it has the
two field the subject field and the body
field right so 2 is where you provide
the email id
so here i just say email because i've
already defined a variable the next is
the subject so i say
attachment
and say the body i'll keep it simple and
say pfa okay now we have to attach the
file right so click on attach files and
here we have to provide the path to the
file so go back to the place where
you've saved your csv file and
copy the path
and paste it here
as an expression and at the end you
provide the name of the file so it was
demo one underscore rpa dot csv
okay so now go ahead click on ok
now we have a lot of other fields to
provide here as well
so here
we have
the port field now the smtp port that
we're using is number 465 so go ahead
and provide that
and the server
is basically smtp.gmail.com
all right and again we have to provide
the email id that is just email
and this is just
password
and then
two is also provided already and the
sender is again me so i say
email again and the password is again
password
all right
so now save it
okay and as you can see
there are no errors
that means it's good to go
okay so let's go ahead and execute this
and see if it executes successfully so
go ahead and execute it
all right so it has successfully
finished its execution so now let's go
to my gmail account and see if i've
received an email and yes i have
so go ahead and click on that
and here
i download the file and see if it's
appropriately sent and here we go so
here we go we have the name of the book
and the author
okay so with this we've successfully
implemented an rpa bot for email
automation now uipath also offers so
many features that you can play around
with to create more advanced rpa bots so
