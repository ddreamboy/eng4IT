in this video we'll create this awesome 
interactive Excel dashboard in just 15 minutes  
first we will structure the dashboard and make 
it Dynamic then we'll create all of the charts  
and visuals and finally we'll customize them to 
fit our look so let's get into it so here's the  
Excel file that we'll be working with which you 
can download for free in the video description  
let's suppose that we're working at McDonald's and 
we're tasked with creating a sales dashboard for  
the South America region and for this we're given 
three different tabs the dashboard where we'll  
have all our charts and visuals then the inputs 
tab where we have all of the data to create the  
visuals and finally we've got contacts tab over 
here just to have the contacts of all the managers  
so let's go back to the dashboard and the first 
thing here is to make this Dynamic so you can  
see that we've got all of these icons here 
to the side we can actually hyperlink them  
such that they navigate to different tabs 
so we'll go to right click on this one say  
and from here towards the bottom 
you'll find the link and we want to  
link it to a place in this document and more 
specifically to the inputs tab we'll hit OK  
the third one we can link as well we'll go to link 
again this time for the contacts and the final one  
here you can see the question mark let's say this 
is the support so it actually links to an email  
so let's suppose this is to an email address and 
you can specifically type say info at support  
.com that's just a made-up email but we'll hit OK 
there and then this first one should go to the to  
this dashboard tab so we'll go to link again and 
Link it to a place in this document the dashboard  
and we'll hit OK the idea here is that when you 
click on one it's gonna take you to the different  
tab we need to add the same thing across all 
of the different sheets so we'll go to this  
first one just select the column by clicking on 
the a here Ctrl C go to control page down Ctrl V  
control page down again and Ctrl V and now we can 
dynamically navigate across the different sheets  
now that we have the navigation in place let's 
work on the general structure so we're going to  
add different shapes here we're just going to go 
to insert then under shapes let's go ahead and  
create a rounded rectangle and we're just going 
to drag it more or less from here from column B  
all the way to column m and here you can decide 
how how rounded you want it to be we don't want it  
too rounded so I'm just gonna hover over there the 
shape fill we're gonna want it in a white color  
with no outline so we're gonna go to no outline 
down over here one final touch here is actually  
adding a shadow on the background of the shape 
kind of like so once we have the shape we can go  
ahead and add a title here so let's call this a 
sales dashboard for now Ctrl a in case you don't  
see it's probably because the text is currently 
in white so we'll change that to say a dark blue  
Ctrl B to bold in to make it bigger you can just 
click on this bigger a here once we have this  
first one you can just hit the Ctrl shift and 
then just drag it that's going to allow you to  
drag it down over here so the idea is to have 
three different shapes here such that they're  
going to be the three kpis so we'll go ahead and 
reformat this let me fast forward how I do that  
then right below that we're gonna have one large 
chart over here and then one smaller one down  
below here so let's do the shapes for that as well 
so Ctrl shift and just drag down let me reformat  
that as well and finally we need to add one more 
shape over here which is going to represent the  
map of South America nice now that we have all 
of the shape structures let me fast forward how  
I rename them here's what the structure with the 
titles is going to be looking like so we've got  
the title and what the figures are in right below 
that we have the three main kpis then we're gonna  
have some kind of a line chart over here alongside 
the customer satisfaction scores and finally a  
breakdown using a map chart to see the sales by 
country now that we've finished this first step  
the second step is to work on the different charts 
and visuals so let's head over to the inputs tab  
for this so control page down here the first thing 
we're going to do is go ahead and select all of  
the customer satisfaction scores here just hit on 
Ctrl a for that and then we're gonna go over to  
insert and we're gonna add what's known as a radar 
chart so we'll go to this drop down over here  
under all charts we're gonna go towards the 
bottom where it says the radar one it was hit  
on OK there and we don't really need this Legend 
here as we kind of have that already in the labels  
so we'll delete we'll also delete the title here 
now you can more or less see how we're doing on  
each of the factors and speed clearly isn't a 
very good one and nor is service we'll just go  
ahead and move this over to the side and make it 
smaller and we'll work on reformatting it later  
right next to that we've got the map chart over 
here so the country breakdown so control a again  
this time under insert we're gonna head over to 
maps go under a field map and we can just remove  
the title layer you can see that's looking fairly 
good already so we'll just make this a bit smaller  
leave it here to the side then for these sales 
figures over here to compare them easily we can  
use something like a line chart so we'll go Ctrl 
a insert and we're going to go under recommended  
hopefully it shows up there and you can see that 
we've got the line chart so we'll hit OK on that  
but you'll notice that this um axis over here 
has way too many labels so you actually can't  
see what's going on within this range so from 
more or less 180 to 250 is what we care about  
so first we'll delete this title here we'll change 
this axis by right clicking on it going to format  
access that minimum amount is the one we want 
to change and we'll add something like 180 here  
and hit enter and now you can see 
that discrepancy a little better  
and again we'll just move that 
to the side for the time being
now let's work on these up over here basically 
here we're gonna get the different proportions  
so the percentage of complete if we look at the 
formula is simply going to be the actual over  
the target so we just want to get these two here 
so the complete and the remainder that's going to  
be enough for us to create a donut chart so we'll 
go under insert under the pi over here we're gonna  
select the donut down below great let's remove the 
title and we don't need the legend either and one  
more thing that we can do here is actually add 
a text box inside which is going to give us the  
percentage that's completed so in this case it 
would be 85. for this let's go to the insert tab  
under shapes here we're gonna select 
the first one which is the text box  
and then we're just gonna drag it over here but 
you can't simply put the 85 percent as that's not  
going to be dynamic so we're actually going to 
go up over here to the formula bar go to equals  
and we'll select that 85 percent ourselves and 
hit enter we can then reformat it so maybe put  
it in the middle and let's also Center it like 
this Ctrl V to bold then we can make it a bit  
bigger to something like size 16. and then we'll 
change the color to something like the dark blue  
great from here let me just go ahead and resize it 
I'm gonna fast forward how I do the same thing for  
all the other ones but one final thing is making 
the donut the width here a bit thicker so we can  
see it a bit better so we'll go to right click 
there go under format data series you can see  
that we have the donut hole size so this is 
what we want to change to something like a 65
and now you can see how it looks a lot thicker 
great let me fast forward how I do the same thing  
for these other ones you can see here as I'm 
working on the second donut chart I just need  
to go ahead inside the text box and change that 
from a d to a g I'm going to hit enter there but  
you'll notice how the formatting all of a sudden 
changes if you want to bring it back to this  
original formatting you just gotta select the text 
box go under the format painter and then just drop  
it over here so click there you can see how it's 
reformatted it the same way let me fast forward  
how I do the last one nice now we have all of the 
key visuals that we're gonna need if you like what  
you're seeing and you want to learn more you can 
also check out our range of courses which include  
Excel for business and finance PowerPoint Finance 
evaluation as well as a range of bundle packages  
and what makes our courses different is 
that they're all applied to the real world  
so aside from teaching the theory our lessons 
also offer case studies that simulate the type  
of work you might be assigned in your day-to-day 
ranging from creating a financial model from  
scratch on Excel to creating a professional 
slide deck presentation on PowerPoint  
and if you get stuck along the way you can easily 
ask us questions in the course discussion forum so  
if you're interested in checking it out you can 
go to the link in the description below alright  
back to the video awesome now that we have the 
dashboard structure individuals we just need  
to bring it all together so for this let's go back 
to the inputs tab first we'll select the map chart  
and just hit on Ctrl X from here let's go back 
to the dashboard and Ctrl V we're just gonna drag  
it over to the side and let me just reformat this 
one you can clearly tell it doesn't look too great  
because the map is so small if you want to change 
that you just need to go to right click under the  
legend first click on the legend right click go 
under format Legend and we want to click deselect  
this button here so show The Legend one now if we 
look at how that looks you can see that it looks a  
lot better because it's removed that spacing then 
let's also remove the fill here for the chart so  
we'll go no fill and we don't want a border either 
so no border now it should all look a lot better  
nice so that's the map chart done now let's 
focus on the other visuals starting with this  
trend trend line over here so we'll go to 
the inputs tab select this trend line Ctrl X  
let's go back to the dashboard here and Ctrl V 
and for this one we're going to want to change  
both the colors and we're also going to change 
kind of how the markers are currently labeled  
first let's select the entire chart under chart 
design let's go ahead and select the third option  
here which looks a bit more elegant then we click 
on that specific line the orange one for now go to  
right click format data series and here is where 
we want to change both the color and the markers  
so we're gonna select a line that's going to be in 
red color and then we're gonna select the marker  
right next to it select marker options and from 
here we want a built-in marker that's gonna be a  
circle so we'll select the circle from here we're 
fine with a size five but we want that fill color  
to be a solid fill that's going to be in white and 
we also want a border for it that's going to be  
a solid line in red let's also increase the width 
of that to something like one point and now we can  
kind of see what that looks like which hopefully 
looks a lot better same thing here with the blue  
one let me fast forward that great so now you can 
see that we've got one in red and the other one in  
dark blue let's also remove the fill here so we'll 
go for no fill and no borderline great now that's  
looking a lot more like it now we'll work on the 
radar chart here for the customer satisfaction  
so go back to the inputs let's control X again 
let's go back to the dashboard and Ctrl V  
and again we'll just drag it over let's try to get 
the same format as this one over here so with this  
um dots as markers so we'll go to 
right click go under format chart area  
we want no fill no borderline and for these 
actual points we're just gonna select them  
and we're gonna go for a solid line that's a dark 
blue color and we're gonna go for a marker that's  
gonna be uh rounded again so built in we'll go for 
a rounded one and let's go for a dark blue color  
solid fill white and we're gonna go for a solid 
line in dark blue and increase the thickness of  
that to A1 as well and there you go great now we 
just have the three kpis left over here and for  
these it would be nice to not just show The 
Donut chart but also have the actual number  
here on the side so for this we're just gonna 
insert a text box so under shapes here we'll  
go for text box and we're just gonna select 
it over here and again we want to make this  
one Dynamic so we'll go equals and we're going to 
link it over to the inputs tab under the actual  
amount for sales and same thing with profit 
customers later so once we have that we need  
to reformat it like we've done before and then do 
the same thing for these let me fast forward that  
now that I have this first one I just gotta go 
Ctrl shift and just drag it across like so and  
then Ctrl shift again and drag this one as well 
now I just need to change the labels by changing  
the link and if you get this issue again where 
it's not formatted properly just gonna select on  
the first one go under form a painter just click 
on that second same thing over with this last one  
like so great now we're ready to go under the 
inputs and select the three donut charts here  
so just hitting the control key you can select 
all three Ctrl X let's go back to the dashboard  
and Ctrl V now we just need to reformat all of 
these so let me show you how I do it for the  
first one let's select it then go to right click 
under format chart area let's go for no fill and  
we'll go for no line as well then we'll select 
the donut just select this this blue part only  
let's say we go for a dark blue color here so 
like the dark blue we've currently been using  
and we'll select the remainder so this area 
that we've still not fulfilled in Orange right  
now so something like a lighter blue like so 
great now let me do these other ones as well  
awesome now we have a really nicely designed 
dashboard which is also interactive using the  
different hyperlinks over here and you can see 
that it tells us pretty much all of the key  
information that we will need in just one sheet
